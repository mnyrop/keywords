				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disability studies scholars recognize that the term “ability” shapes our understanding of what it means to have a livable life. Although it is often treated as the antithesis of “disability,” ability has been used as a conceptual sledgehammer to determine and shape social status and caste on both an individual and a collective level. In effect, “ability” employs a judgment that establishes standards of body and mind that are actionable in the present or in projected futures.</p>
<p>Today ability and disability are conjoined as a simple binary. In the past, the relationship was more fluid. Aristotle viewed “monstrous” bodies as natural <em>anomalia</em> (Greek for “irregularities” or “unevenness”), that represented different types of “ability.” Since the late 1300s, “ability” has signified a quality in a person that makes an action possible; in turn, someone who can execute an expected range of actions is able-bodied, a person who can lead a potentially worthy life. “Ability” in the Anglo-Norman world was a legal term tied to capacity to enter into contracts or inherit property. Hence “ability” began to point to an exclusionary matrix in which it belonged only to propertied men. The rest of the population (nonpropertied men, women, people of color, beggars, and changelings) had an invalidated and disabled status to a greater or lesser extent.</p>
<p>Not all representations of the “abnormal” or disabled body are so infused with negativity. In “On the Refusal of a Pension to the Invalid” (402 BCE), Lysias, a speechwriter and Attic orator, argues that physical impairment did not in itself class an individual as <em>ordunatous</em>, or unable (Lysias 1957). It is not surprising, then, to read that Marcus Sergius, a Roman general during the Second Punic War (218 BC), returned to battle as a double amputee, fitted with iron hands. Throughout much of premodern Western history, ability and able-bodiedness referred to a person’s role in the community rather than to a fixed condition.</p>
<p>The term began to refer to a type of person in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, when “abled,” as an adjective, described a “capable, vigorous and thriving” person or object (the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> cites the example of an <em>abled tree</em>). Still, it had no coupling with an assumed opposite of a disabled subject. That coupling began to emerge during the age of enlightenment (ca. 1700–1800), which ushered in a new spirit of optimism about the rationality and autonomy of man and afforded the attributes of will, authority, and reason new prominence. Such sentiments held out promises of the perfectibility of the body. Mental or bodily ambiguity came to represent anomaly and aberrance, and the dis/abled person was identified with failure, hopelessness, and the necessity for surveillance, repair, and management.</p>
<p>Science and philosophy during this period were concerned with working out which beings were “human” and which were not. Discussions like those of John Locke in <em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em> (1955) were related to physical and intellectual capacity, animality, and species ranking (including a discussion of rankings according to notions of gendered characteristics associated with a hierarchy of abilities). In 1727, “able-bodiedness” referred to those who are “fit, and healthy, physically robust, free from physical disability” (<em>OED</em>) and thus fit for the army or work. It is not surprising, then, that there was a shift from able-bodiedness as an attribute of character to able-bodied people as an identifiable class capable of selling their labor. The next 200 years saw the expansion of global markets and colonization, the Industrial Revolution, and the rise of manufacturing. Governments, medicine, and the sciences of population management and economic efficiency were concerned with harnessing labor and regulating idleness and capacity. The human body was marked and measured in terms of efficiency. An example of this typification of abledness occurs in Fritz Lang’s film <em>Metropolis</em> (1927), in which the cyborg Maria becomes a corporeal clock mediating time, pace, and the quality of well-being itself. Ability came into sharp focus during World War I, when bodies were destroyed and maimed on an unprecedented scale (Carden-Coyne 2009). Whereas “ability” had been partially defined by fitness for armed service, now modern war was transforming the meaning of ability, with a new connotation of lives that needed to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>By the second half of the twentieth century, the contested meanings of ability took on new urgency as society contended with the need to reintegrate large numbers of disabled soldiers and to create a productive workforce. From the twentieth century onward, distinctions between abled and disabled bodies have been linked to notions of the productive body within particularized economies, such as agriculture, manufacturing, or technology. In the 1980s, the term “abled” was decisively coupled with disability in a negative relation. According to the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>, the term now meant a “full range of ordinary physical or mental abilities”—in other words, not disabled. Whatever new meanings attach themselves to “ability,” the concept is now firmly paired with an opposite that is deficient, provisional, and nonproductive. The contemporary world is witnessing a new “abled,” signifying an unencumbered worker who is a master of economic possibility and available for further corporeal enhancement as the economy or workplace requires it.</p>
<p>Increasingly, ability and abledness assume an independent, unencumbered self. This hyperproductive, gender-neutral employee has replaced the gendered rhetoric of the main (male) breadwinner. This worker is the übercitizen who is mobile, portable, available 24/7, 365 days a year. People with disabilities rarely fit this mold, as they may have bodily or cognitive needs that cannot be mechanically routinized or normalized. Meanwhile, developments in surgery, pharmacology, and other consumer technologies are rapidly transforming notions of “normal ability.” Today’s “normals” may end up being tomorrow’s abnormals, and what seem like hyperabilities can become standards of future ability.</p>
<p>Throughout these changes, what Robert McRuer calls “compulsory able-bodiedness” persists. For McRuer (2002), able-bodiedness, like heterosexuality, is an ideal that is constantly to be striven for but impossible to achieve. More broadly, “ableism” refers to the ideological hypervaluation of ableness and the ways in which such norms of abled and disabled identity are given force in law, social policy, and cultural values. Such norms shape and are shaped by claims about the impaired, non-abled body’s legitimacy or fraudulency (for instance, in claiming social benefits), legal protections, and social status.</p>
<p>A disability studies critique of “ableism” takes the focus away from disability as a self-contained designation. Ableism denotes the ideology of a healthy body, a normal mind, appropriate speed of thought, and acceptable expressions of emotion. Key to a system of ableism are two elements: the concept of the normative (and the normal individual); and the enforcement of a divide between a “perfected” or developed humanity and the aberrant, unthinkable, underdeveloped, and therefore not really human. The notion of ableism is useful for thinking not just about disability but also about other forms of difference that result in marginality or disadvantage. Interrogating ableism means thinking about what being abled means today in different contexts, and how those meanings intersect with other ideologies of body and mind such as race, gender, sexuality, and coloniality.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The noun form of the word “access”—meaning “the power, opportunity, permission, or right to come near or into contact with someone or something”—first appears in published texts in English as early as the 1300s. It has been used to characterize the relationship between the disabled body and the physical environment since the middle to late twentieth century. More specifically, it refers to efforts—most prominent in the United States—to reform architecture and technology to address diverse human abilities.</p>
<p>In its most literal form, “access” describes the ability to enter into, move about within, and operate the facilities of a site, and is associated with architectural features and technologies, including wheelchair ramps, widened toilet stalls, lever-shaped door-handles, Braille lettering, and closed-caption video. Figuratively, however, it can suggest a much broader set of meanings linked to a more inclusive society with greater opportunities for social and political participation. Given these technical and metaphoric interpretations, the push for access has yielded some contradictory results. While improved public infrastructure has been a major success of the disability rights movement of the last half century, technical change does not necessarily translate to the deeper goals of openness, inclusion, or opportunity. In fact, in some cases technical compliance can replace and even obscure the movement’s broader goals of social, political, and economic integration.</p>
<p>Though “access” and its corresponding adjective “accessible” have distinct meanings in relation to disability rights, both terms convey broader arguments about rights and opportunities. Discussions of social and economic justice often refer to an ideal of access: “access to jobs,” “access to housing,” “access to health care,” and so forth. These expressions convey the importance of recognizing external barriers that prevent disenfranchised persons from gaining access to resources. They exist in contrast to debates over inherent or biological inequality, such as sexist or racist arguments that view women or nonwhites as physically and mentally incapable of equality. A focus on access is a shift away from attempts to fix or cure disability on an individual level, and toward an emphasis on social or legal interventions. Access implies social potential not dependent on correcting the disabled body, but instead made possible through institutional and material change.</p>
<p>In the history of disability rights, the concept of access linked disabled people’s material struggles with other civil rights causes. In debates over the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared that “all members of the public should have equal access to facilities open to the public” (tenBroek 1966, 849). The disability rights movement emerging in the same period interpreted this language for its own cause. The legal scholar Jacobus tenBroek wrote in 1966 of a “right to be in the world,” rooting the rights of the disabled in core principles of citizenship. Barriers to free mobility, tenBroek wrote, violated a “basic sense of the right not to be unjustly or causelessly confined,” a right he traced to the Magna Carta and major Western constitutions (848). Legal advocates Marcia and Robert Burgdorf similarly linked “access” to core American rights. “Free access to public buildings and transportation systems,” they wrote in 1975, was a key component of disabled persons’ rights to equal protection under the law (Burgdorf and Burgdorf 1975, 855–866).</p>
<p>Access holds the curious distinction of being seemingly easy to define and comprehend but difficult to create. As early as the 1960s, for instance, building codes in the United States defined access in clear, specific terms. Local regulations mandated such features as wheelchair ramps of less than 1:12-foot rise; doorways of at least thirty-two inches in width; and grab bars in toilets (<em>American National Standard Specifications</em> 1961). The difference between the ideal and the real, however, often proved significant. The first national law that addressed access, the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, required that architects design or renovate buildings purchased and leased by the U.S. government “to insure whenever possible that physically handicapped persons will have ready access to, and use of, such buildings.” The phrase “ready access” suggested the possibility of a site’s availability to any given disabled person. In reality, the components of legal compliance were often piecemeal and failed to add up to overall improvements in usability. Early regulations applied to specific buildings, so a courthouse or hospital might be technically accessible, but without sidewalks, curb cuts, or usable public transportation, actually getting to and into the building remained difficult for many. Even in the present day, compliance with the law can be fleeting when building tenants or managers leave elevators or ramps locked, allow accessible features to fall into disrepair, or obstruct spaces and passageways.</p>
<p>The demand for improved access follows the logic of the “social model” of disability, which shifts attention from the impaired body to the surrounding environment. Early advocates used the term in a very literal way, evaluating sites and products in terms of their function for people with physical and sensory limitations. The category “accessible” delineated the reachable from the unreachable: ramped entrances and clear pathways from stairs and cramped passages. In technical guides and government policies, “accessibility” and “usability” often appeared with the related term “barrier-free.” If “access” was the outcome of diligent planning, “barriers” were the existing conditions, often characterized as needless or “thoughtless” obstacles. These analyses of “access” and “barriers” pointed to problems and solutions in the physical environment, not fixes for the individual body. Disability activists likewise point to architecture as an external barrier that prevents people otherwise willing and able to participate in society from doing so. In a 1990 transportation protest, a black disabled man taped a sign to the back of his wheelchair stating, “I can’t even get to the back of the bus,” linking lack of physical access to the history of racial segregation (“Civil Rights, Disability Rights”). In a number of protest actions—including the occasion of a 2004 Supreme Court ruling on disability discrimination lawsuits—wheelchair users left their chairs at the bases of grand staircases to government buildings and crawled up the steps (Shapiro 2004). These actions perform the argument that it is not physical inability but the absence of architectural accommodation that keeps people with disabilities excluded from the public spaces identified with civic life.</p>
<p>While the most extensive requirements for access mandated by law originated in the United States, access has proven a powerful concept in disability rights discourse on a global level. Architectural access is now included in civil rights legislation in Australia, the United Kingdom, South Africa, and the province of Ontario, Canada. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, ratified in 2008, requires signatory nations to provide “reasonable accommodation,” including technological and architectural access. Still, the American model of building ramps, expanding doorways, and installing technologies to improve access does not translate immediately to global contexts, particularly for areas without extensive paved roads or centralized transit infrastructure. Furthermore, in a human rights framework accessibility can describe not only the concerns of those considered “disabled” but also those of women, children, migrants, and others who experience constraints of movement and expression (Meekosha and Dowse 1998). Attention to access, therefore, proves most powerful when interpreted broadly, bringing notice to mobility and communication barriers that may not be as tangible as sidewalk curbs and public announcement systems.</p>
<p>Mandates requiring accessibility remain fraught even after decades of legal battles and new legislation governing arenas ranging from private offices to online shopping. At stake in these debates are core American and Western values of individual and social citizenship. Rights discourse often centers on the value of “independence”—that is, being able to move about and do things on one’s own, without the assistance of doctors, nurses, parents, or charitable strangers. The ideal of an accessible public environment follows this conception of citizenship as autonomy. And yet, in practice, claiming the rights to autonomy through accommodation can be interpreted as a neoliberal critique of the welfare state, which fosters the notion that individualism and independence are prerequisites for good citizenship. The late historian Paul Longmore details the “ceremonies of social degradation” that accompany social welfare and other entitlements, inculcated in endless paperwork and bureaucratized misdirection (2003, 240). Access, too, comes with its rituals of shame, as in cases when disabled citizens must pursue legal action to demand usable workplaces or accommodating schedules, leading to frequent accusations of fraud, moneygrubbing, or selfishness. Lennard Davis describes the sense, rooted in modern psychological theory, of disability as a form of narcissism, and the demands for accommodation as “self-concern rather than a societal concern” (2002, 124).</p>
<p>In recent years, some scholars and activists have questioned the centrality of access to the mainstream disability rights agenda. While the principle of access seems infinitely expandable, it often narrows to discussions of architectural details such as stairs and ramps. The International Symbol of Access—the white figure in a wheelchair against a blue background—seems to exemplify the problem of representing disability solely in terms of mobility impairments, and access solely in terms of wheelchair access. It centers the ideal of access on overcoming the realities of barriers. While few would question the importance of establishing and enforcing architectural access, these laws also show some of the limitations of technological interventions in a neoliberal political economy. Access can represent a form of outsourcing, as authorities implement technological change without addressing underlying prejudices and misconceptions. As disability advocates shift their rhetoric, they urge a look “beyond ramps” and emphasize those disabilities (including psychological and intellectual concerns) for which accommodation may not take tangible form (Russell 1998).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“What happened to you?” The question from strangers to people with visible impairments suggests a popular fixation on <em>accident</em> as a cause of disability. It is as though the most important thing to know about disability is its genesis (Linton 2005)—perhaps due to anxiety about whether or not “it could happen to me.” This narrow meaning of accident as unforeseen bodily trauma (as compared with illness, congenital trait, or aging) highlights one axis of diversity that both enriches and complicates disability studies.</p>
<p>In a broader and more abstract sense, disability is often relegated to the category of <em>accident</em>: unintentional, undesirable, marginal deviations from idealized norms of fitness. It was not always so. Early conceptions of disability imbued certain bodily differences with religious meaning, as coded signs of divine intent or judgment. In step with the values of industrialization, nonconforming bodies later came to be equated with accident, much like assembly-line cast-offs. The spectacle of the mid-nineteenth-century to twentieth-century carnival freak show as a refuge for extraordinary bodies exemplified such marginalization, with its sharp boundary between the onlooker and the “freak of nature” (<em>lusus naturae</em>) on display. In spite of the freak show’s demise, disability is still often associated with defect as opposed to natural variation. Through the scientific lens, the disabled body becomes a medicalized anomaly—“I’m ‘that accident,’” (Wade 2010)—which, if not prevented from existing in the first place (as through eugenic interventions), can at best aspire to “overcome” environmental barriers or be rehabilitated to normalcy. Disability studies rejects the assumptions that underlie this view, foremost by affirmatively valuing disability experience and accepting bodily diversity not as accidental but as essential to society.</p>
<p>Like impairment itself, the disadvantage associated with disability is often glossed as unfortunate happenstance. In one of the field’s key contributions to cultural studies, the “social model” locates disability not in individual bodies themselves but in their interactions with social practices, institutions, and the built environment. If disability is the disadvantage that flows from these structural relationships (a view that some criticize as erasing aspects of disability experience such as pain and loss of function), then neither disability nor any presumed standard of fitness is truly accidental.</p>
<p>What of specific instances of bias that exclude people with disabilities: Is disability discrimination haphazard and marginal (contrasted as it often is to race and gender discrimination) or systematic and central to social hierarchy? Who or what is responsible (in a causative sense) for it, and who if anyone should be held responsible (in a legal sense) for remedying it? As with gender and race, whether people can claim a legal remedy for disability discrimination depends in part on whether unequal treatment was inadvertent or intentional. Recent studies of unconscious bias, however, show that this dichotomy overlooks predictable patterns of prejudice that further complicate disability discrimination law.</p>
<p>In sum, though <em>accident</em> has no specialized meaning within disability discourse, its multiple senses illuminate the contributions of disability studies as well as tensions within the field.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Accommodation” bears a more positive and powerful meaning in disability discourse than its roots in race and religion contexts would predict. In the history of U.S. racial politics, “accommodation” is a dirty word. Accounts of the early civil rights era used accommodation to refer to a brand of gradualism and compromise associated with Booker T. Washington—a position famously critiqued as “conciliation” by W. E. B. DuBois (1994; Myrdal 1944). But while racial accommodation evokes blacks accommodating the white majority, in the disability context accommodation means changing society in response to disability. The term has thus shifted radically in both sense and reference.</p>
<p>Accommodation gained prominence as a keyword in disability politics and theory through legal discourse. In the United States, which introduced the term into our legal vocabulary, accommodation began as a right of religious employees under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Almost immediately, however, courts emptied it of force. Most important, in <em>Hardison</em> (1977) the Supreme Court has interpreted accommodation not to include religious “preferences,” such as avoiding work on Saturday, and to require employers to bear no more than a de minimis cost to accommodate an employee’s religion.</p>
<p>Accommodation in U.S. disability law, by contrast, is more robust. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, which has served as a model for many other nations’ laws (Herr 2002), requires “reasonable accommodations” that do not impose an “undue hardship” on employers, including “making existing facilities . . . readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities” and such specific efforts as “job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, . . . the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations.”</p>
<p>Moreover, contrary to its view of religious accommodations, the Supreme Court said in <em>US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett</em> that “the [ADA] requires preferences in the form of ‘reasonable accommodations’ that are needed for those with disabilities to obtain the same workplace opportunities that those without disabilities automatically enjoy. By definition any special ‘accommodation’ requires the employer to treat an employee with a disability differently, i.e., preferentially.” Though the Court has limited this conclusion significantly, the principle of a broader concept of accommodation for disability remains.</p>
<p>One central conceptual debate surrounding accommodation concerns whether accommodation requirements are fundamentally different from, or of a piece with, other responses to discrimination. This issue touches on the broader problem of analogies. In U.S. debates, race typically serves as a starting point for discussions of discrimination; in Europe and elsewhere, sex begins the conversation. As a result, disability advocates and theorists often confront the demand to analogize disability rights to movements based on these other categories. These demands translate into a particular question about accommodation: Within the rights discourse of law, is <em>accommodation</em> a form of <em>antidiscrimination</em> or something altogether distinct?</p>
<p>The ADA itself provides one answer by defining “discriminate” to include “not making reasonable accommodations.” This is significant because many U.S. courts and some scholars understand discrimination to mean, centrally or exclusively, differentiating in favor of or against a group along a protected axis like race. They therefore see accommodation as an entirely different creature, since it involves making affirmative changes to the environment in response to difference (Karlan and Rutherglen 1996). Consistent with a growing scholarly trend (Bagenstos 2003; Jolls 2001), the text of the ADA cuts against this view by treating the failure to accommodate <em>as falling within the definition of “discrimination” itself</em>. Recent amendments to the ADA may, however, inspire courts to interpret the law in ways that emphasize differences, rather than similarities, between disability discrimination and discrimination on the basis of race and sex (Emens 2013).</p>
<p>A second debate concerns the costs and benefits of accommodation. To some minds, discussions of disability accommodation evoke Kurt Vonnegut’s Handicapper General, who makes everyone “equal” by requiring them to wear masks, heavy weights, and loud headsets to offset any advantages they might have in beauty, strength, or intelligence (Vonnegut 1968). In this dystopian vision, burdensome adjustments in the name of equality drag down the entire society.</p>
<p>Many employers see accommodations as costly endeavors that will hinder productivity. As a result, accommodation requirements may lead to so-called disemployment effects, depressed hiring of disabled people in response to disability laws (see Bagenstos 2004b). But empirical research indicates that such effects are temporary, suggesting that employers may discover after a time that accommodations are less costly, or more beneficial, than anticipated (Jolls and Prescott 2004).</p>
<p>Indeed, most accommodations are not costly, and many impose no direct costs at all (Schartz, Hendricks, and Blanck 2006). Where Vonnegut’s story is about leveling down, accommodations should aim to level up, allowing otherwise qualified people to perform jobs successfully. Moreover, the benefits of accommodations have frequently been underestimated. U.S. courts, for example, have portrayed accommodations as costly to employers and to third parties (such as coworkers and customers) but useful only to the individual disabled employee (Emens 2008). But disability accommodations can have broader benefits to coworkers, customers, and the wider society (Stein 2003). For example, ramps and curb cuts benefit not only people in wheelchairs but also people with strollers, suitcases, or bicycles, and disability has inspired technological innovations such as voice-to-text software, closed captioning, and ergonomic furniture design. Accommodation can therefore be understood in either static or dynamic terms (Emens 2008). On a static model, accommodations are small tweaks to the existing baseline to make room for an individual. On a dynamic model, accommodations take disability as the impetus to recalibrate the baseline for everyone. The static model fits neatly with some early meanings of the term “accommodation”—as referring to “a favour” or “concession” (<em>OED</em>)—and is probably the most common popular understanding of the term. But the dynamic model captures important elements of the landscape of accommodation. For example, universal design typifies the dynamic model because it tries to create an environment that is always ready for the widest variety of possible users. More broadly, employers often have a choice—commonly overlooked—about whether to design accommodations on a static or a dynamic model. For example, if an employee asks to work from home (telecommute) to accommodate his disability, the employer can either permit a special exception for this employee or use this request to spur the creation of a telecommuting initiative that may please many employees and create cost savings for the company (Emens 2008).</p>
<p>Of course, there may be trade-offs among accommodations, and also among design principles. For instance, curb cuts may be great for wheelchair users but present new challenges for people with vision impairments, and designing workplace accommodations in ways that create the most third-party benefits may not always lead to the best version of particular accommodations for those who requested them. These problems require careful consideration and, some would say, rethinking of concepts such as universal design (Shakespeare 2006a). They raise the question of whether accommodations should be reserved for those deemed to need them most—such as people with disabilities—or whether the right to accommodation should be expanded to create a greater entitlement for all workers. The nonprofit Workplace Flexibility 2010 initiative has proposed a universal accommodation right, aligning the interests of workers who have obvious needs for accommodation, such as disabled people and caretakers, with the interests of the broader workforce in flexible arrangements that may allow them to pursue any number of needs and interests, including spiritual practices, educational pursuits, or volunteer activities. A universal accommodation right sounds utopian until one considers that it could involve as minimal a requirement as a “right to ask” without consequences.</p>
<p>For some scholars, accommodation will always be too limited a model because it is grounded in antidiscrimination principles. These thinkers argue that accommodation can only go so far without a robust human rights approach that brings together negative and positive liberties—that is, an approach that brings freedom <em>from</em> interference with one’s aims together with freedom <em>to</em> access equal goods and opportunities (Stein 2007; see Berlin 1969). A model for this approach is the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD; 2008), which embraces civil, political, economic, and social rights, thereby combining a commitment to accommodation with a complementary insistence on social supports like vocational training. Through the CRPD, the concept of accommodation continues to be important to efforts to create equal opportunities and access both for people with disabilities and for the not-yet-disabled, which is to say, everyone.</p>
<p>These legal and conceptual endeavors all take accommodation to mean altering the environment to respond to disability. But Harriet McBryde Johnson (2003) turns this definition on its head in her elegant essay about her surprisingly cordial meeting with Princeton professor Peter Singer, whose brand of utilitarianism implies that people with disabilities like hers should not exist at all. Johnson explains why she disagrees with those who see Singer as a monster. His views, she observes, are simply not so far from those of many people she encounters every day: “The peculiar drama of my life has placed me in a world that by and large thinks it would be better if people like me did not exist. My fight has been for accommodation, the world to me and me to the world” (Johnson 2003, 79). Johnson thus reminds us that accommodation, in the disability context, may be shadowed by what it has meant in terms of race—the marginalized group in some way compromising with the mainstream—and suggests that the two meanings may be, for better or for worse, inseparable.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Activism is a practice of, or orientation toward, taking action, often implying the context of a social or political movement. Although activism emphasizes collective action, an individual and his or her actions may be considered “activist” depending on their relationship to larger struggles. Disability activism refers to “collective political action by and for people with disabilities” (Barnes and Mercer 2010, 176), which contributes to “the continuing struggle of disabled people to gain a voice and to shape our destinies” (Longmore 2003, 231). The word “advocacy” is sometimes used interchangeably with activism, since a person may advocate on behalf of others. But although some scholars and activists include advocacy by parents and other nondisabled allies under the category of disability activism, leadership by disabled people in activism is crucial to collective autonomy.</p>
<p>While recognizing a plurality of disability movements, and groups within disability movements, the late Paul Longmore argued that some shared goals and stances predominate. These include the reframing of “disability” as a social and political, rather than simply a medical and rehabilitative, problem; the shift in priorities from correcting individuals to reforming society; the assertion that the necessary means for social participation and integration, whether devices and services or access and accommodations, should be enforceable civil rights rather than dispensations of charity; the contests for power with professionals and bureaucrats; and the quest for both individual and collective empowerment and self-determination (Longmore 2003, 114).</p>
<p>Addressing disabling barriers to political participation and mobilization is another unifying concern (Charlton 1998). For instance, many disabled adults encounter inaccessible voting arrangements or are ineligible to vote (Barnes and Mercer 2010, 158–160). Educational barriers hinder effective organizing. Transportation barriers make it difficult to hold meetings or participate in public gatherings. Community meetings and political events are often held in structurally inaccessible spaces, with poor air quality or use of scented products, and without accommodations for nondominant languages or multimodal forms of communication. These and other forms of disenfranchisement have motivated activists to demand change and also to take steps to ensure accessible spaces, processes, and communication strategies within disability movements.</p>
<p>Disability activism arose in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as some people with disabilities began to organize to resist restrictions on their freedoms and demand economic opportunities within industrial economies. Blind people and other disabled people in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Ireland formed associations to fight for social and economic rights and modeled their aims and tactics on working-class and trade union struggles (Ó Cathain 2006). In the mid-twentieth century, blind, deaf, and physically disabled people engaged in separate struggles for specific policies, with each group seeking to better its educational or economic opportunities. Parents of children with disabilities organized locally and internationally to resist institutionalization and advocate for community living and educational access.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, a confluence of developments enabled a cross-disability political consciousness to emerge in the United States. Observation of and participation in the civil rights movement, the Black Power movement, the women’s movement, and other collective struggles of the 1960s and early 1970s exposed men and women with disabilities to tactics of protest and enabled them to begin recognizing and questioning violations of their human and civil rights. The women’s health movement, in particular, questioned medical power and supported individual empowerment. Yet people with disabilities often experienced barriers to full participation in these movements.</p>
<p>Other developments opened opportunities for new understandings and increased expectations of freedom from institutionalization and professional domination. In the late 1940s, for instance, disabled veterans of World War II experienced barrier-free mobility in dedicated spaces at the University of Illinois, Galesburg (later relocated to Urbana-Champaign), which encouraged them to challenge institutionalized barriers to their broader social and economic reintegration outside of the university setting (Pelka 2012). Meanwhile, the first generation of physically disabled youth who had attended public schools began demanding access to higher education and developing new models of user-controlled services. In the early 1960s, University of California, Berkeley, undergraduate Ed Roberts and his colleagues—known as the Rolling Quads—were inspired in part by other forms of student activism at Berkeley, including the Free Speech Movement and the women’s movement’s refusal of imposed passivity. Roberts went on to establish the Disabled Student Program on campus; in 1972, he cofounded the city of Berkeley’s Center for Independent Living (Fleischer and Zames 2001, 36–39).</p>
<p>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which mandated equal access in federally funded programs and buildings, created a watershed opportunity for disability activists. Yet by the mid-1970s the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) had delayed enforcement of the new regulations. In 1977, disability activists—led by the group Disabled in Action—responded with sit-ins of federal buildings in New York, Washington, DC, and San Francisco (Barnartt and Scotch 2001). A broad array of nondisabled ally groups supported the twenty-five-day occupation by disabled activists of the HEW regional headquarters in San Francisco. Through these weeks, a number of emergent disability rights activists—some of whom were also active in the Black Power movement—shared stories and came to understand the relatedness of their experiences across different impairment categories (Schweik 2011). This deepened understanding across categories of race, class, gender, and ability enabled protesters to commit to shared political struggle (Longmore 2003).</p>
<p>Simultaneous developments in the United Kingdom reflected parallel shifts in consciousness as well as political strategy. The Union of the Physically Impaired against Segregation (UPIAS) developed what has become recognized as the social model of disability as a way of rejecting professional and charitable dominance and asserting the inherently unjust social and political bases of disability-related inequality and exclusion. This new way of defining disability in terms of exclusion rather than embodiment helped activists across impairment groups to recognize common experiences of exclusion and restricted life chances and to build a shared politics of disability.</p>
<p>These shifts undergirded extensive coalition building across the globe through the latter decades of the twentieth century and galvanized such remarkable organizational and legislative successes as the United Kingdom’s Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act (1970), France’s Declaration of the Rights of Handicapped Persons (1975), Disabled Peoples International (established in 1981), American Disabled for Accessible Public Transit (ADAPT; established in 1983), the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990), and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2008).</p>
<p>Despite the spread of cross-disability organizing and the growing embrace of the social model of disability among diverse activists, disability rights movements continue to be “a splintered universe” of loosely affiliated groups and shifting coalitions (Shapiro 1994, 126). Factions within disability movements often have overlapping membership and goals, and they reach out to one another for solidarity and costrategizing on specific campaigns. In the United States, some groups have arisen from specific, impairment-related histories of segregation and other forms of institutionalized oppression; these include blind people’s activist groups; psychiatric “survivors,” “mad activists,” and other current or former mental health service users who protest the treatment and social situation of those who are labeled mentally ill; and self-advocacy movements such as People First and the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network.</p>
<p>Other groups have organized in relation to intersectional political identities, including Feminist Response in Disability Activism (FRIDA) and indigenous peoples’ disability activist groups. These groups challenge racism and patriarchy within disability groups. Some groups have organized to address specific issues; ADAPT, for example, first organized in the early 1980s to fight for transportation access, now focuses on deinstitutionalization and community living. Other groups include those that resist a liberal, civil rights–based approach and advocate a more radical vision of social justice, for example, the disability justice movement and Occupy Wall Street–related groups. Not Dead Yet fights physician-assisted suicide and related life-ending policies and practices under which persons with physical disabilities and chronic illnesses are disproportionately targeted. And although they have worked in coalition for cross-disability legislation, Deaf Pride movements continue to distance themselves from disability identity, asserting instead a linguistic and cultural minority identity and refusing to associate deafness with impairment.</p>
<p>There is little agreement as to which actions rise to the level of “activism”; a seemingly wide array of tactics may be considered activist. The term “click-tivist,” for instance, has recently been used to dismiss Internet-based activism that may be poorly informed and requires little individual effort. Yet the increasing use of information technology and social media has enabled geographically disparate disability groups to organize, and many groups have broadened their communicative and coalition-building capacities. Disability activists in Ontario, for example, may be unable to meet frequently in person across hundreds of miles, but they strategize online. Deaf activists in Ghana and elsewhere communicate largely by e-mail and text. U.S. activists with chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome and multiple chemical sensitivities, for whom in-person activism is largely inaccessible, engage from home via the Internet. A monthly “Organizers Forum” phone call allows activists from disability groups across the United States and beyond to connect, learn together, and exchange ideas.</p>
<p>Although much social and policy advocacy now takes place online, street protests, disruptive occupations, and performance-oriented street theater remain crucial ways to draw attention to disability issues that might otherwise be rendered invisible. The line between political protest and performance often has been blurry. ADAPT protesters crawled up the steps of the U.S. Capitol in 1990 to protest delays in passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Elderly women activists in Syracuse, New York, protested closure of the Ida Benderson Senior Center in 2011 by organizing and participating in a public head shaving. Jerry’s Orphans repeatedly disrupted the (now-defunct) annual Muscular Dystrophy Association Telethon in Chicago and documented these efforts on film.</p>
<p>Some activist events take a playful tone and gesture toward alternative social arrangements and definitions. Mad Pride Week in Toronto, for example, utilizes a variety of participatory performances such as the Mad Hatter’s Tea and the Bed Push Parade to celebrate mad pride, history, and culture. Such activism does not propose policy; rather, it makes visible the everyday quality of disability oppression while also celebrating disability experience and culture and engaging bystanders in imagining and even coperforming alternatives.</p>
<p>Simi Linton has observed that “disability studies both emanated from and supports the Disability Rights Movement” (qtd. in Fleischer and Zames 2001, 206). Many groundbreaking scholars in disability studies—Ed Roberts, Simi Linton, Paul Longmore, Jim Charlton, and Carol Gill, to name but a few—emerged directly from activist backgrounds and resistance movements. Activism is—in Robin D. G. Kelly’s phrase—an “incubator of knowledge” (qtd. in Schweik 2011), and the collective wisdom of disability activism is preserved in oral history interviews with activists as well as from memoirs, activist blogs, zines, photographs, films, and other forms of social documentation. Yet much of how we think about disability has emerged not only through the work of activists but also through theoretical engagements with disability activism by scholars in disciplines including sociology, history, anthropology, and literary and cultural studies.</p>
<p>Although academia and activism are interdependent, they are often, unfortunately, pitted against one another. On the one hand, activists may perceive the work of academics and scholars as theoretically abstract and call for more accessible and relevant disability scholarship (O’Toole 2009). On the other hand, scholars may dismiss activism as naive or excessively concerned with short-term, utilitarian goals. Yet this relationship, however fraught, might be a productive one if reconfigured as symbiotic and collaborative. Activists can keep scholars current, grounded, and aware, while scholars in turn may construct “usable pasts,” depictions and theorizations that aid activists in critically understanding the present in order to work toward a different future (Longmore 2003, 9).</p>
<p>With the significant growth of disability studies programs over the past two decades, the accountability of scholars to disability activist communities is an often-debated question. The privilege and security enabled by academic salaries and benefits are rare commodities among disabled people, who are among the most impoverished and disenfranchised groups globally. Yet such privilege also engenders responsibility to facilitate tangible social and political transformation. Disability scholars often engage directly in activism by advocating for governmental and institutional policy changes, joining community-based activist groups, supporting student activism, and working to end exclusionary practices in scholarly associations and the academy itself.</p>
<p>Of course, scholars also address this accountability through their scholarship. Humanities scholars uncover experiences and knowledge of disability that complicate dominant narratives; activists may take up such knowledge in a variety of ways. Some social researchers (Goodley and Lawthom 2005) engage in participatory action research that sheds light on realities of community life while building self-advocacy among participants. Some UK sociologists, such as Michael Oliver, have insisted upon a strict “emancipatory” model, in which disability scholarship is guided and led by disabled activists in a way that supports the disability community’s policy agenda. Doing so is not straightforward, however, as disability activists are not unified, and activist agendas require both scholarly support and critical examination if they are to promote justice. For example, Kelly (2010) warns that when minority model–based activism glosses over the diversity of needs and interests within the disability community, the resulting policies may help some subgroups while neglecting or harming others.</p>
<p>While scholarship can shed a needed critical light on the inner contradictions of movements, it can also help to foster dialogue and alliances among them. Currently, disability activist-scholars are building bridges with prison abolition movements, organizations, and activist groups that promote antiracist and anticapitalist platforms, and those movements that embrace animal rights, food justice, and environmental justice. These emerging dialogues and coalitional politics promise to complicate and deepen our understandings of disability and its multiple intersections.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether addressing ideas of beauty in nature or works of art, aesthetic judgments implicate disability insofar as they presume a normative standard of perception and an ideal of bodily perfection as the object of affective response. Although theories of taste and beauty have been in existence since Plato and Aristotle, the term “aesthetics” emerges centrally in the eighteenth century as a discourse about perception and feeling. For Immanuel Kant, for instance, an aesthetic judgment is distinct from one involving deductive reasoning or conceptual information concerning the object. He distinguishes between teleological and aesthetic judgments, the former of which concern objects, purposes, and intentions; the latter are disinterested, based on subjective apprehension. Kant implies that disinterested pleasure is distinct from the self-interested pleasure we obtain from satisfying a drive or solving a problem. In a paradoxical move, however, he also claims that my feeling of pleasure is validated by my presumption that others would feel the same way (“when [a man] puts a thing on a pedestal and calls it beautiful he demands the same delight from others” [Kant 1952], 50). This conflation of noncontingent personal pleasure with collective assent is the cornerstone of bourgeois aesthetics, from Karl Marx to Herbert Marcuse. It is also the source of ableism as the ideology of bodily normalcy.</p>
<p>The claim of disinterestedness presents a conundrum for disability studies. It represents an attempt to legitimate judgments of taste by removing the body that makes such responses possible, or more precisely by diverting bodily responses onto objective forms. But judgments of taste are always framed by social attitudes and cultural contexts. Such values constitute forms of cultural capital in the reinforcement of class privilege, and as such restrict competing views of beauty, sensory satisfaction, and human variety. When the seventeenth-century Spanish artist Diego Velázquez places the Infanta at the center of his painting <em>Las Meninas</em>, for instance, he includes a court dwarf at her left, as a grotesque contrast to her youthful perfection. An aesthetic of disinterestedness is never far from a formalist desire to project the work of art as a <em>cordon sanitaire</em> against bodily variety and corporeal mutability.</p>
<p>Eighteenth-century and early nineteenth-century aesthetic treatises attempt to provide for subjective experience the kind of authority claimed by empirical science. Yet the criteria for judgment often presuppose an ideal of embodiment. Johann Joachim Winckelmann, for instance, sought artistic perfection in classical sculpture based on the perfect Greek body. He argued that “masterpieces [of classical art] show us a skin which is not tightly stretched, but gently drawn over a healthy flesh, which fills it out without distended protuberances and follows all the movements of the flesh parts of the body in a single unified” direction (1985, 37). By contrast, Gottfried Lessing felt that certain emotions—such as pain—can be better expressed in poetry, while bodily infirmity and variety may be the ideal subject for painting, since they create a challenge for the artist’s mimetic potentiality. Lessing believed a modern artist would declare, “Be you as misshapen as is possible, I will paint you nevertheless. Though, indeed, no one may wish to see you, people will still wish to see my picture; not in so far as it represents you, but in so far as it is a demonstration of my art, which knows how to make so good a likeness of such a monster” (1985, 63). For Lessing, realistic depiction of a “misshapen” man is less important for its verisimilitude than for its demonstration of artisanal superiority.</p>
<p>In both Winckelmann and Lessing, the ability of aesthetics to define affective and sensory response depends on—and, indeed, is constituted by—bodily difference. In Kant, by contrast, the aesthetics of beauty is only one half of a dialectic between bounded and unbounded sensations. The latter, associated with theories of the sublime, is the inevitable site of cognitive and physical difference in their challenge to our reasoning faculty. Theories of the sublime during the eighteenth century were inspired, to some extent, by the eighteenth century’s discoveries in medical science or what Michel Foucault (1984) calls the “politics of health.” In Edmund Burke’s <em>Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful</em> (1968), the sublime is defined through the author’s medical researches into physical pain. For Burke, the sublime is superior to beauty because it leads to further consciousness and action, whereas beauty recedes into lassitude and passivity. The experience of pain is beyond reason and comprehension, a state that challenges ideas of mortality and finitude. Once released from pain, the individual enjoys the “joys of convalescence” whereby we learn to appreciate a health we had previously taken for granted.</p>
<p>A key theater for theories of the sublime can be found in the Gothic tradition. As an antidote to Enlightenment rationalism, Gothicism engages with various forms of bodily difference and psychological otherness. Where Winckelmann vaunts human perfection in health, smoothness, and unity, the Gothic explores the pathological, uncanny, and monstrous. David Punter observes that “the history of . . . the Gothic [is] a history of invasion and resistance, of the enemy within, of bodies torn and tortured, or else rendered miraculously, or sometimes catastrophically whole” (2000, 40). Gothic fiction offers a catalog of characters who exhibit bodily deformities, mental disability, or psychic distress: from Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein to the blind rabbi of Charles Robert Maturin’s <em>Melmoth the Wanderer to the giant of The Castle of Otranto</em>, the <em>One-Handed Monk</em> and the narrator in Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Fall of the House of Usher.” As a camera obscura on Enlightenment aesthetics, the Gothic displays, according to Ruth Anolik, “human difference as monstrous, and then, paradoxically, [it] subverts the categories of exclusion to argue for the humanity of the monster” (2010, 2).</p>
<p>David Mitchell and Sharon Snyder (2000) refer to such images or metaphors as “narrative prostheses,” since their appearance in literary works provides a figurative (and, often, a literal) crutch to a redemptive story of bodily renewal. Oedipus’s self-blinding is an inaugural moment in Western art’s linkage between moral life and bodily deformity. Similarly, Shakespeare’s Richard III’s hunchback is a physical embodiment of his corrupted sense of power, while Dickens’s Tiny Tim’s limp facilitates Scrooge’s redemptive vision of charity. The function of such narrative prostheses is to provide readers with a model of bodily difference from which they may distance themselves. What the disabled body disturbs in the moral universe, the redeemed, healthy body recuperates, just as the death of the monster or the villain restores the health of court and state. As Mitchell and Snyder summarize, “While an actual prosthesis is always somewhat discomforting, a textual prosthesis alleviates discomfort by removing the unsightly from view” (2000, 8). The rhetorical trope of pathos, the appeal to an audience’s emotions, is often purchased by an identificatory logic that turns aesthetics into pedagogy. Pity and fear, those qualities Aristotle ascribed to tragedy, may be aesthetic criteria for mimesis, but they are embodied in a blind and crippled Oedipus.</p>
<p>Since the late nineteenth century, modernist art has had recourse to deformed or grotesque bodies to metaphorize the condition of what Matthew Arnold called “this strange disease of modern life” (2004, 1093). The canon of high modernism is replete with representations of physical and mental disability—from aestheticism’s convalescents to Expressionist portraits of demented urban denizens, to the blind and neurasthenic figures in T. S. Eliot’s poem <em>The Waste Land</em>, to Andre Breton’s cognitively disabled heroine in <em>Nadja</em>, to Henry James’s invalids Ralph Touchett and Milly Theale, to William Faulkner’s cognitively disabled Benjy Compson, to the consumptive heroines of opera, to the incarcerated narrator of Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “The Yellow Wallpaper.” Nazi <em>Entartete Kunst</em> (“degenerate art”) exhibitions of the late 1930s used modernism’s depiction of “defective” or dysgenic persons in Expressionism or Surrealism as a sign of Western culture’s decline, in contrast to the idealized Aryan bodies in rural settings depicted in the “Great German Art Exhibitions” endorsed by Hitler. If the salient feature of modernist art and literature was its emphasis on the materiality of the medium and the defamiliarization of everyday life, its thematic focus was embodied in a blind soothsayer, a child with Down syndrome, a tubercular artist, and a hysteric woman (Davidson 2008).</p>
<p>The turn in modern aesthetics’ dependence on a discourse of disability is powerfully evident in art’s reliance on a disabled person to symbolize moral flaws or frame the able-bodied hero’s moral recovery. In the late nineteenth century, for instance, convalescence became a key trope for philosophical acuity and aestheticism. Literary figures such as Edgar Allan Poe’s narrator of “The Man of the Crowd,” des Esseintes in Joris-Karl Huysman’s <em>Au Rebors</em>, or the title character in Friedrich Nietzsche’s <em>Zarathustra</em> are only three of many convalescents whose return to avidity from illness inaugurates a new intense, passionate interest in the world. Modern aesthetic theories also have a taxonomic function insofar as they attempt to organize and rationalize sensory experience. For Jacques Rancière, “the practices and forms of visibility of art . . . intervene in the distribution of the sensible and its reconfiguration” (2009, 29). This distributive or categorical function parallels in many ways the biopolitical rationalizing of bodies and cognitive registers that emerged in medical science during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries but was refined and perfected in the twentieth.</p>
<p>Modernist aesthetics is also dominated by the idea that literature “lays bare the device” of language through formal rupture and non sequitur (Shlovsky 1965). Twentieth-century Russian formalists such as Viktor Shlovsky, Boris Eichenbaumm, and Roman Jakobson have theorized that literary devices such as metaphor, patterned rhyme, and narrative frames “make strange” the everyday and quotidian so that it can be experienced anew. Disability theorists have come to similar conclusions about the ways that disability unseats ideas of bodily normalcy and averageness. Ato Quayson (2007) calls the discomfort that disability occasions among able-bodied persons “aesthetic nervousness,” a recognition of bodily contingency that arises in the presence of the nontraditional body. Lennard Davis (2002) argues that disability, because it crosses all identity categories, “dis-modernizes” biopolitical regimes that attempt to fix and categorize bodies through medical technologies and population control. Aesthetic defamiliarization and disability deconstruction are joined by their critique of mimesis—the idea that there is a putatively “real,” “given” world that must be represented and cited. When art foregrounds its own operations, when disability unsettles the normative body, mimetic criteria are shattered and the means of aesthetic and social reproduction exposed.</p>
<p>The attempt to differentiate the “normal body” in modernity was aided by a number of developments in visual culture that made the nontraditional body more visible. Photography was enlisted by eugenics and race theorists to catalog aberrant or dysgenic “types,” while films such as <em>The Black Stork</em> (1917) provided documentary evidence justifying fetal euthanasia, sterilization, and incarceration. Antivagrant laws or “ugly laws” were instituted in a variety of U.S. cities to prevent “unsightly” or disabled persons from appearing on the street (Schweik 2009). As Martin Pernick (1996) observes of such developments, aesthetic values were often used to define those “lives not worth living” and remove them from public view. Modern reform movements in favor of suffragism, birth control, women’s health, workplace improvements, and settlement houses were often fueled by eugenicist ideas about health, genetic purity, and ability. In Lennard Davis’s terms, “enforcing normalcy” becomes a preoccupation of modern social and medical sciences for which both high art and mass culture provide prosthetic reinforcement.</p>
<p>The twin legacies of an aesthetics of disinterestedness and a biopolitics of health and genetic improvement have helped to shape what Tobin Siebers calls “an aesthetics of human disqualification,” a “symbolic process [that] removes individuals from the ranks of quality human beings, putting them at risk of unequal treatment, bodily harm, and death” (2010, 23). Fitter family contests, “ugly laws,” and freak shows of the modernist era provided individuals with an opportunity, during a period of social fluidity and change, to imagine themselves as not “ethnic,” not “feebleminded,” and not disabled. Mass cultural spectacles and modernist art both contributed to such an aesthetics by making visible bodies with which one would not want to be associated while validating sensory responses to bodies that confirmed one’s own integrity and vitality.</p>
<p>Siebers (2010) uses the phrase “disability aesthetics” to draw attention both to the formative role of disability <em>in</em> aesthetics and the aesthetic practices of disabled artists whose work engages in a critique of ableist attitudes. In 1990, for instance, when disability activists from American Disabled for Accessible Public Transit (ADAPT) left their wheelchairs to crawl up the steps of the U.S. Capitol building in support of the Americans with Disabilities Act, it was an act of civil disobedience. But it was also—vividly—a form of disability performance art. Such theatrical gestures blur the boundary between art and activism that has characterized much disability aesthetics in the recent period. The performance artist Mary Duffy, born without arms, poses nude while adopting the position of classical sculpture. She uses her posture as a nude Venus de Milo (who also lacks arms) to address her audience and rearticulate feminine beauty from a disabled and gendered perspective. The deaf artist Joseph Grigley makes installations out of the “conversation slips” (matchbooks, bar napkins, Post-its) he exchanges with his hearing interlocutors. The neurodiversity activist and autistic artist Amanda Baggs uses a software interface to transcribe her written text into an electronic voice that urges her audience to learn “her” language of repetitions, scratchings, and monotone humming. The blind photographer Evgen Bavcar photographs classical sculpture and archaeological sites, often intruding his hand into the image to instantiate his reliance on a tactile rather than retinal relationship to objects.</p>
<p>The situation of deaf poets and performers presents a specific challenge to traditional aesthetic ideals based on printed or verbal representation. Many deaf persons think of themselves not as disabled but as a linguistic minority who compose their poems and performances through sign language. Many of the themes of d/Deaf performances involve the history of oralist pedagogy that emerged in the mid-nineteenth century and that dominated attitudes toward the assimilation of deaf people into hearing culture (Baynton 1996). Poets such as Clayton Valli, Debbie Rennie, Patrick Graybill, and Ella Mae Lentz create works in American Sign Language (ASL), most often repudiating voice-over translation in order to “speak” directly to a nonhearing audience (Brueggemann 1999). Deaf artists’ interest in differentiating themselves from disability illustrates the difficulty of defining disability aesthetics within a single category with a common history. Furthermore, it forces us to rethink the largely ocularcentric character of aesthetic discourse and configure it around other sensory avenues and cognitive registers.</p>
<p>“There is no exquisite beauty, without some strangeness in the proportion.”  Edgar Allan Poe’s quotation of Francis Bacon in “The Philosophy of Composition,” summarizes the crucial link between art and otherness, between the aesthetic and the different bodies that constitute it. In an essay that advocates the most extreme example of artisanal control, Poe’s belief in poetry’s need for “strangeness” exemplifies the aesthetic’s uncanny dependence on difference. What Terry Eagleton calls “that humble prosthesis to reason,” the aesthetic depends on a body that reason refuses to recognize. One must remember that the ideal forms that the humanities vaunt as epitomes of proportion and grace—the Venus de Milo, <em>La Victoire de Samothrace</em>, Leonardo’s Vitruvian man—are, respectively, armless, headless, and possessed of multiple arms and legs. The aesthetic discourse that creates disinterested appreciation of the beautiful is also the one that has historically relegated the hunchback to the dungeon, the fat lady to the freak show, and the deaf person to the asylum. The close proximity of aesthetic judgment to carceral isolation and rationalized euthanasia is the darker side of Enlightenment knowledge, even as the increased visibility of the disabled body creates the occasion for its liberation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Affect,” a term understood by some to be synonymous with “feelings” and “emotion,” is associated with a set of theories that are useful for understanding somatic experiences that generate meaning outside the limits of signification and critical interpretation. The turn to theories of affect among writers including Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Adam Frank (1995b) and Brian Massumi (1995) was provoked by a sense that cultural theory had not adequately come to terms with forms of embodied feeling experienced outside the registers of speech, signification, communication, and meaning. A major catalyst of the “affective turn” (Clough 2007) was the publication, in 1995, of two essays: Sedgwick and Frank’s “Shame in the Cybernetic Fold,” a work that introduced the writings of American experimental psychologist Silvan Tomkins to readers in literary, feminist, and queer theory; and “The Autonomy of Affect,” an essay in which Massumi expanded upon French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s use of the term “affect” in <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em> (1987).</p>
<p>Tomkins’s method of understanding affect, articulated in work collected between 1962 and 1991 in four volumes of his lifework, titled <em>Affect, Imagery, Consciousness</em> (reprinted as Tomkins 2008), was to observe embodied expression, spontaneous gesture, and comportment as factors through which we might come to understand affect, the motivating force or response system that supports and modulates human drives. Rather than focusing on what people say (as Freud did in his “talking cure”), or on communication, knowledge, and meaning production, Tomkins focused on embodied expressions and interactions to decipher the circuit of emotions through a system of nine categories of affect. Tomkins’s writings on shame, the subject of a volume of excerpts from his work edited by Sedgwick and Frank (1995a), have become especially important for disability studies scholars interested in how feelings of shame can be generated, expressed, shared, hidden, or amplified—often outside the realm of language. Sedgwick and Frank (1995b) introduced the writings of Tomkins on shame as a corrective to politically engaged critical theory that—in their view—focused too narrowly on language and disembodied meaning in the critical interpretation of social and political life, missing the variable, sometimes delicate and fleeting but important place of affect in political and social experience. Rather than seeing shame as a sentiment that should be overcome to achieve pride, they propose, with Tomkins, that shame holds a transformative potential that can be worked through even in its indirect or subtle forms to enable expression and identity.</p>
<p>The work of Gilles Deleuze on affect, as interpreted by Massumi, also has been influential in exploring the significance of affect as a concept through which to get past the impasse of signification and meaning as the locus of cultural and political theories of opposition, rights, and political transformation. Ann Cvetkovich and Ann Pellegrini (2003) were among the authors who emphasized the importance of understanding the public and political dimensions of affect and sentiment.</p>
<p>A critical interrogation of positive public affect, notably pride, is needed in disability studies in much the way that public shame and pride have gained centrality in queer studies. If pride is the repudiation of shame, how do we approach with respect those who feel shame without assuming a patronizing educative stance or a sense of pity? A critical interrogation of the affective dynamics of pride may allow disability studies to work through the problematic of humanitarian patronization that is rightfully disparaged in the field. Sally Munt (2000) and Elspeth Probyn (2000) offer insight about the ways in which shame, rather than being something that must be overcome and replaced with pride, offers the potential for queer political affinity and empathy.</p>
<p>One of the core contributions of affect theory is to change the way that influence and power are understood. In the most general sense, to affect someone is to influence or change his or her mental or emotional state. This seems to imply that the object or person that elicits feeling wields power over the person who is “made to feel.” But the relationship that makes up affect, if we are to draw from either Tomkins or Deleuze, is far more complicated. Most often, agency is reversed in ways of describing this relationship. We rarely state with absolute certainty, “I moved her,” though we are likely to feel some certainty about feelings when we admit, “I was moved by her.” Often we attribute our affective response to something we have strongly felt emanating from the other person’s outward affect. We may even feel as if our own feelings were directly drawn out of us by that person’s emission of <em>inner</em> feeling—this is what we call “being affected” by someone: “I was touched [affected] by her [tragic, stunning] life story,” or “I was struck [affected] by the change in his behavior.” A humanist spin on these formulations is that they describe positive empathetic relationships. What, after all, could be wrong with the idea of one person picking up directly, intimately, on the inner feelings of another? Isn’t that what it means to be human?</p>
<p>From a disability studies perspective, however, such a seemingly simple idea is inherently troubling, especially when we consider the historical evidence of those who have exploited empathy—in the form of charity, pity, or awe—to describe perceived physical, cognitive, or mental differences in the other, from the standpoint of a presumed social norm. The person whose life story is perceived as tragic may not believe it is tragic at all, for example, and may feel disgusted that someone has “felt their pain” when in fact he or she does not feel pain at all, or in the imagined way.</p>
<p>Not all affective relationships are misrouted and patronizing, of course. But often when we notice affect, it is precisely through relationships like these that entail considerable projection on the part of the perceiver, and that are weighted on the side of the perceiver’s feeling some “direct” connection that is in fact projective (see Cartwright and Benin 2006). Affect is thus subject to a complicated intersubjective dynamic that is not generally in the control of the person whose affect is being “felt,” interpreted, or narrated by another. This imbalanced relationship can easily default to a system where normative judgments creep in, on the part of the one feeling and the one whose feelings are “felt” by another. Pity expressed toward one with a disability may generate shame, anger, or disgust in the person who was intended to be the beneficiary of pity as largesse.</p>
<p>Affect thus can bear a close relationship to stigma. This is evident in the use of “affect” to imply that someone’s behavior is not natural or genuinely felt—as in the disdainful suggestion that someone is behaving pretentiously or with conceit: “She spoke with an affected manner.” We use this phrase to condemn the person in question for performing his or her affect “unnaturally” or in a charade, as if we all shared a template for normative or natural ways of acting in public. But because all mannerisms are modeled after or against normative ways of speaking, gesturing, and interacting, labeling anyone as “affected” can be problematic. Think of how often gay men are said to exhibit a gay “affect” for mannerisms that may be common among gay men but are atypical of straight male behavior. To label one category of behavior as affected and leave the other (straight male) affective behaviors unmarked is to make the notion of affect itself stigmatic. If I have a cognitive, motor, or sensory difference that keeps me from expressing my feelings through presumed normative (natural) gestures and cadence of voice, then I might gesture and speak deliberately in a performed, “affected” way. For example, I might overcome the social stigma of having “flat affect” in my interactions by scripting my interactions and reperforming them “with feeling” in social settings, taking on a manner of speaking or relating that may seem to my interlocutors to be unnatural or a pretense, but which I have carefully learned in order to pass as neurotypical. To label my mannerisms as “affected” and someone else’s similar affect as normal is an irony of the affective social domain, which presumes that “natural behaviors” are spontaneously performed and not consciously learned or assumed.</p>
<p>For some scholars, the structure of affect and empathy is tied historically to the emergence of aesthetics. One classic notion is that nature’s “harmonious” lines and colors are the inspiration for architectural form—as if nature “speaks” directly to our feelings through its forms. As Susan Schweik (2009) has argued, aesthetics and affect are intimately tied to the history of mandating normative or ideal-driven models of physical appearance as law. Schweik shows how public outrage against the appearance of “freaks of nature,” for example, or aversion toward “ugly” people comes from the undesirability of feeling affective states such as disgust and shame. Affect, in the sense of feeling, is thus powerfully tied to the troubling fate of bodies perceived to violate norms of aesthetic expression in public space. The “ugly laws” that banished people with visible disabilities from public spaces through much of the twentieth century laid blame for this generation of feelings of shame projected as disgrace on the outcasts themselves.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The biological process of growing older, human aging is almost always accompanied by limitations in physical capacities and, in many cases, diminution of mental acuity. In addition, aging is, like disability, both a biological and a cultural phenomenon that is inflected decisively by the social, legal, medical, statistical, and experiential meanings given to it. For example, old age may be defined by a society in chronological terms (in the United States, ages sixty-two and sixty-five mark eligibility for Social Security) and individually in psychological terms (someone may be seventy-five years old and “feel” fifty). In the United States and many other industrialized nations, aging, as Susan Wendell (1999, 133) has written, is disabling. Aging is invoked rhetorically—at times ominously—as a pressing reason why disability should be of crucial interest to all of us (we are all getting older, we will all be disabled eventually), thereby inadvertently reinforcing the damaging and dominant stereotype of aging as solely an experience of decline and deterioration (Davis 2002; Garland-Thomson 2005; Stiker 1999). But little sustained attention has been given to the imbrication of aging and disability (for exceptions to this rule, see Wendell 1996; Silvers 1999; Kontos 2003). Aging is not—yet—a keyword in disability studies.</p>
<p>Nor have the insights of disability studies been taken up in any depth in age studies, a relatively small field that for the most part, unlike disability studies, has not been entwined with identity politics. In 1969, the gerontologist and psychiatrist Robert N. Butler coined the term “ageism” in analogy with other social prejudices based on biocultural categories, such as sexism and racism. But the cultural study of age, with attention directed to older age understood to be part of the normative American youth–old age system, did not emerge in the United States until the 1980s. As cultural studies scholar Margaret Gullette has memorably put it, we are aged by culture. Gender has been fundamental to the analysis; as lesbian writer and activist Barbara Macdonald wrote in 1983, “Youth is bonded with patriarchy in the enslavement of the older woman. There would, in fact, be no youth culture without the powerless older woman” (39). Also fundamental to analysis has been the spectacle of the aging body. The “decline” associated with aging is largely detected in a visual register, while passing and masquerading as young—aided by a plethora of antiaging products and practices—serve as strategies for evading exposure as old (Katz 2005). At the same time, if disabled bodies can be understood as anomalous and extraordinary, visibly marked aged bodies are typically considered so ordinary that they recede from view, becoming invisible (Woodward 1991, 2006). The able body is the norm; so too is the healthy youthful and middle-aged body.</p>
<p>What are the biopolitical dimensions of aging today in neoliberal economies? As with most biopolitical queries, scale matters. Around the world, many national populations are aging. For centuries in the West, old age was considered part of the spiritual journey of a life (Cole 1992). Beginning in the twentieth century, however, as life expectancy increased enormously and in some cases almost doubled, aging became a medical problem to be solved, with an accelerating search in the twentieth-first century for scientific keys to slow down and stop the process. Aging populations present an enormous economic contradiction: on the one hand, aging populations constitute a huge market; on the other hand, political leaders, economists, policy makers, and others often regard an aging population as a potentially catastrophic impediment to the vitality of their national economies, as insufficiently productive. At the same time, in anticipation of old age, retirement accounts grow globally, which even in times of economic downturn can make enormous sums for investment available; unsurprisingly and ironically, a good portion of those investments are in antiaging research.</p>
<p>Aging is a process; disability is typically understood as a condition, as something one has. Temporally, aging and disability converge in the case of frailty, a syndrome often associated with advanced old age. As such, frailty—and to a certain extent aging itself—is conceptualized simultaneously as a disability in the present and as a risk factor for developing a disability in the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blindness is a condition of the flesh as well as a signifying operation. William R. Paulson maintains that blindness “means very different things, and moreover it <em>is</em> very different things, at different times, different places, and in different kinds of writing” (1987, 4). Such a critical stance can lead the field of disability studies to analyze disability in a manner that reckons with both the ways that bodies are made accessible through language and the ways that bodies exceed language. The state of visual impairment long ago assumed a metaphoric plasticity, making literal blindness serve as a figurative marker for other diminished capacities. This interplay permeates, for example, one of the West’s foundational texts, Sophocles’s version of the story of Oedipus. It is evident in the confrontation between Tiresias, the blind prophet, and the figuratively blind Oedipus, as well as in the ghastly scene where Oedipus literally blinds himself upon gaining his figurative sight (Stiker 1999).</p>
<p>Perhaps the earliest English-language example of blindness’s physical/metaphysical conflation occurs in the tenth-century <em>Blickling Homilies</em>. The narrator of the second quire, <em>Quinquagesima Sunday</em>, observes of the blind beggar of Jericho, “Right was it that the blind man sat by the way begging, because the Lord himself hath said, ‘I am the way of truth,’ and he who knows not the brightness of the eternal light is blind; and he liveth and believeth who sitteth by the way begging, and prays for the eternal light, and ceaseth not” (Morris 1880, 16). This exegesis clearly demonstrates a transformation of the physically blind beggar into a surrogate for the intransigent spiritual blindness of all sinners. By taking care of the blind beggar, sinners can move closer to Christ and therefore erase their own metaphoric blindness. In his examination of l’Hospice des Quinze-Vingts, the institution founded in Paris by Louis IX in 1256, Edward Wheatley (2002) argues that the church treated physical blindness as evidence of sin, which could be ministered to in order to imitate Christ’s role as protector and healer.</p>
<p>During the European Enlightenment, blindness became fetishized in debates among both rationalists and sensualists. As in the Middle Ages, though, it was not really visual impairment itself that was central to such debates; rather, blindness became a form of “narrative prosthesis” (Mitchell and Snyder 2000; Davidson 2008). Blindness aroused the thoughts of several Enlightenment philosophers because of an intellectual quandary posed by William Molyneux, a Dublin lawyer, to John Locke in 1688. Molyneux asked whether a man born blind who had tactually learned to tell a globe from a cube would be able, upon having his sight restored, to immediately distinguish through vision one object from the other. In later printings of <em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em> (1955), Locke answered Molyneux’s epistemological problem by arguing that such a man would be incapable of distinguishing the objects by sight alone. Inclusion of the query and Locke’s response in Locke’s seminal text brought the hypothetical scenario to the attention of eminent philosophers such as Berkeley, Condillac, Leibniz, and Voltaire, who regarded blindness as a mere intellectual puzzle that held no social value by itself. By contrast, it formed the impetus for Diderot’s <em>Letter on the Blind for the Use of Those Who See</em>, which explored blindness as a valid subject unto itself.</p>
<p>Against a backdrop of emerging industrialization and modernization, blindness became not a marker of sin, as it had been during the Middle Ages, but a marker of sloth. James Gall, a pioneering Scottish educator of the blind, for instance, declared that a blind person’s “condition is a state of continuous childhood. . . . He can produce for himself neither food nor clothing; and without the unceasing assistance of his friends he would of necessity perish” (1834, 13). Without intervention, it was feared that the blind would wallow in unproductivity and gross dependence. In the nineteenth-century United States, pedagogy for blind students heavily emphasized Protestant Christianity and nationalistic ideals; together they were meant to implant in blind students an ethos of independence, thereby making them capable of performing sighted normalcy. Furthermore, through educational and vocational institutions blind people were disciplined toward industrious participation in the nation. Such disciplinary practices were intended to transform them into facsimiles of the sighted. Additionally, this inculcation was meant to ameliorate the anxiety many sighted people had over blind people’s inability to join the imagined community of the nation.</p>
<p>Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, blindness was increasingly indexed according to complicated metrics of visual acuity, and there were tremendous efforts to achieve complete empirical exactitude. A universal medical definition, however, has proven elusive, and various global institutions have come to employ different quantitative standards. The inability to secure total agreement regarding the measurement of blindness demonstrates how “the evaluation of impairment is . . . full of errors of reification and false precision” (Stone 1984, 116). As such, the failed quest for an absolute metric has given rise to multiple classification schemes, all of which measure degrees of blindness.</p>
<p>This is illustrated by the U.S. Bureau of the Census and the World Health Organization, which use different criteria for diagnosing what constitutes blindness. For both institutions, the logic of categorization is buttressed by ophthalmological measurements of blindness. Such definitions may prove useful in terms of policy decisions and the disbursement of financial benefits, but they also have the effect of dividing the blind community. Kenneth Jernigan, for instance, a long-serving former president of the National Federation of the Blind, observed in an essay originally published in 1962 that “the complex distinctions which are often made between those who have partial sight and those who are totally blind, between those who have been blind from childhood and those who have become blind as adults are largely meaningless” (2005). For Jernigan, as for many activists and scholars in disability studies, organizing around a common identity for social gains has proven more relevant than classificatory nuances.</p>
<p>Perhaps because no universal technical definition of blindness exists, the scale incorporating multiple measures of blindness employed by different medical domains has not significantly influenced sighted culture at large. Sighted culture accepts only a total, plenary blindness, a stark binary of presence/absence. One either sees nothing or one sees everything; there is no allowance for a liminal state of partial blindness or partial sightedness, what Beth Omansky (2011) has termed the “borderland of blindness.” This may explain why sighted people still experience both trepidation and wonder at imagining the phenomenological dimensions of blind people’s existence, stemming largely from the belief that the blind body has only limited access to the world through a pitiable, incomplete sensorium. Georgina Kleege wryly recognizes how many sighted people go “into raptures” when describing a blind person’s “ability to recognize . . . voices, to eat spaghetti, to unlock a door. People sometimes express astonishment when I find the light switch or pick up my coffee cup” (1999, 27). Guided by such erroneous presumptions, sighted culture fashions the blind body into a totem of daily miracles, where even the most quotidian activities seem extraordinary.</p>
<p>Anxiety among the sighted makes it seem that a life of blindness is necessarily devoid of autonomy, agency, or the possibility for any positive affect. Such a broad cultural misconception empowers the dominant nondisabled culture to believe that blindness is existentially incomplete, a stigmatized state of deprivation. As Michalko (1999) has noted, blindness represents a lack that menaces sighted culture; it is an absence not only of sight but also of independence, intellectual acumen, morality, and productivity. Blind people are thus confronted with two options: either succumb to disciplining practices in order to perform normalcy—that is, some version of sightedness—or else face rejection.</p>
<p>One curious aspect of medical discourse is that it opens the definition of blindness to perpetual revision because the clarity and focus of the techno-medical gaze are always becoming sharper. For example, the reductive social binary of being either sighted or nonsighted diverges from medical conceptualizations of blindness, which acknowledge that people experience various forms of blindness in different and uniquely subjective ways. Some experience a mélange of colors; some see eruptions of paramecium-like shapes; and for some photophobia precludes direct exposure to light. Less than 10 percent of people who identify as blind possess no light perception whatsoever.</p>
<p>Medicine’s perpetually revised definitions of blindness imply that the sought-after complete description and comprehension of blindness will someday be the precursor of techno-medical mastery. Moreover, it is presumed that such mastery will cross a biological horizon and at some imagined point take the form of absolute cure. This is not new; medicine has conceived of blindness as being an inevitably conquerable condition, a belief that stretches from the second-century AD cataract surgeries by Galen of Pergamon to the first recorded reversal of blindness, performed by English surgeon William Cheselden in 1728, to the exuberant contemporary fantasies of the posthuman in the early twenty-first century.</p>
<p>Such efforts at mastery are problematic because they often displace efforts to improve the social conditions of current blind people. Future inquiries centered on blindness should instead assist in establishing a greater understanding of how human variation is an asset, and not a liability. Several disability studies scholars have created a foundation upon which future inquiries might be built. Robert McRuer’s (2006) work, for example, can facilitate an understanding of how blindness “crips” sighted culture. The concept of the “normate,” proposed by Rosemarie Garland-Thomson (1997, 2009), challenges ocularcentrism, including the presumptive right to stare at others that saturates sighted culture. In addition, Shelley Tremain’s (2001, 2008) application of Foucauldian theories to the ethics of disability demonstrates how poststructuralism can productively influence new conceptualizations of blindness and sightedness. Finally, the study of blindness can lead to fresh insights in fields outside of disability studies. Because so many cultural categories and disciplinary practices are based on sight and the visual inscription of the body, blindness can reveal how sight influences negative constructions of people of color, women, queer people, and disabled people without visual impairments, thereby recasting modernity’s problematic foundational assumptions so that a richer inclusivity might be gained.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although the disability rights movement (DRM) and the field of disability studies (DS) have emerged and blossomed together, the two have developed along slightly different trajectories. While the DRM has demanded the establishment of laws and policies that treat people with disabilities as equal and valued citizens, DS has created the intellectual and creative groundwork to reimagine disability not as a biological defect but as a valued form of human variation that exists within and is deeply affected by its social context. Because the DRM uses rights as its organizing framework, it is not surprising that citizenship and rights are central intellectual concepts in DS as well. For example, the DRM slogan “nothing about us without us” encapsulates an ideology of valued and equal citizenship. Disability studies has taken up this call by examining the meaning, content, and impact of citizenship as well as the ways in which disability is central to systems of citizenship.</p>
<p>Briefly defined, citizenship serves to demarcate who is a member of the national community and to establish the relational expectations among citizens, noncitizens, and the state. Rights constitute a key resource of citizenship, providing a tool to influence others, pursue one’s interests, and mark one as a respected member of the state (Carey 2009). Early scholarship on disability and citizenship focused on documenting the exclusion of people with disabilities from the rights and typical opportunities enjoyed by other citizens. According to Martha Minow (1990), the United States has a dual-track legal system in which individuals deemed competent and rational enjoy the rights of modern citizenship, whereas those deemed incompetent and irrational are placed in positions of subordination where they are “cared” for and “protected” rather than given equal civil rights. This system of paternalism reinforces the dependence of people with disabilities (Hahn 1983, 1988) and in effect creates a “dependent caste” (Funk 1987) of people with disabilities who have access only to “second-class citizenship” (Eisenberg 1982). Often, early DS research concerning rights left citizenship as a vague or undefined background concept. When citizenship was considered, it tended to be included in a package of rights granted by the state to individuals (Marshall 1950). The goals of DS research, then, were to identify the ways in which people with disabilities were provided with inferior “packages” of rights, examine the problematic assumptions behind this inequality, and thereby insist on access to equal rights.</p>
<p>Disability scholars and activists were rarely satisfied, though, with the assumption that equality would flow from obtaining the “same” package of rights. Disability studies brings to light the importance of human variation and reveals the ways in which the policies, standards, and rights based on an able-bodied norm may further reinforce exclusion. Therefore, it was not long before DS scholars began to develop innovative reformulations of citizenship theory. Some of the most important reformulations rely on the concepts of <em>practice</em>, <em>relationality</em>, and <em>embodiment</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>practice</em> approach argues that the exercise of citizenship involves a set of dynamic, relational practices, including constructing, claiming, and using rights. For example, analyses of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) emphasize the active negotiation of rights (Campbell 2005; Engle and Munger 2003; Francis and Silvers 2000; O’Brien 2004). Rather than offering firm guarantees, the rights granted by the ADA provide a set of resources that can be potentially harnessed by people with disabilities to shape identity, discourse, and interaction between themselves and others (Bérubé 2003). Thus, it is not enough to have formal rights; rights that are merely on the books cannot solve all matters of inequality because people must be able to claim and use those rights actively in order to participate in society. A practice approach centers on the role of inequality—including unequal access to resources, valued social roles, and cultural/interpersonal respect—in shaping the ways we experience citizenship (Turner 1993).</p>
<p>Disability studies has also expanded the literature on the <em>relationality</em> of rights and citizenship. Liberal political philosophy imagines the citizen as a rational independent person. In line with feminist scholarship, disability studies has interrogated ideas about personhood (Kittay and Carlson 2010a; Reindal 1999) and showed the ways in which our identities, actions related to rights, and power to shape our world are all relational phenomena (Beckett 2006; Carey 2009; Mason 2004). Kittay, for example, critiques the traditional emphasis on independence: “In acknowledging dependency we respect the fact that as individuals our dependency relations are constitutive of who are and that as a society we are inextricably dependent on one another” (2001, 570). Thus citizens are not isolated rational individuals; rather, they are interrelated and interdependent actors whose identities and actions are shaped by their relational web and social context. This account transforms not only the way we think about citizens and citizenship but also law and social change. The concept of relationality undergirds the ADA, which sets forth obligations on the part of employers and community members to create accessible conditions in support of the equal participation of people with disabilities (Silvers 1998). It also is fundamental to alternative approaches to liberal political theory, such as the capabilities approach, human rights theory, and care theory, each of which seeks new ways to include all people as respected and valued citizens in society through recognizing our diverse capabilities and our shared vulnerabilities (Beckett 2006; Kittay and Carlson 2010a; Nussbaum 2006).</p>
<p>Disability studies has also been in the forefront of illuminating the concept of embodied citizenship, as scholars have increasingly sought to move beyond conversations solely about how society treats disability to examine how the body affects our experiences within the “body politic” (Siebers 2008b; Wendell 1996). For example, people with autism not only have different experiences because society treats them differently; they also experience the world differently because they process information differently. Hughes, Russell, and Paterson (2005) therefore call for a theory of embodied citizenship that recognizes and problematizes diverse corporeality in a society that expects bodily conformity and uniformity. As with ideals like rationality and autonomy, the “normal body” is illusory, yet it forms the foundation of traditional ideals of citizenship (Russell 2011). The normal body, argues Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, is assumed to be unimpeded by architectural barriers, stares from those who pass by, gangly uncoordinated and shaky movements, or unarticulated patterns of speech. By contrast, the disabled body is assumed to be susceptible to external forces, “property badly managed, a fortress inadequately defended, a self helplessly violated” (1997, 45). Scholars such as Martin Pernick (1996) and Susan Schweik (2009) showcase the ways in which physical difference defined as monstrous or ugly justifies exclusion, segregation, and even death. Broader ideologies centered on safeguarding the “health” of the nation and creating a “fit” population have also legitimatized the denial of rights (Baynton 2001; Mitchell and Snyder 2001). Moreover, society enforces “compulsory able-bodiedness” and demands the invisibility and/or compliance of people with disabilities (McRuer 2006). Disability collides with sexuality, race, gender, and class in the formation of a stratification system that privileges some and disadvantages others. Robert McRuer further shows the ways in which systems of oppression uphold each other, such that homosexuality and disability are used in conjunction to reinforce the normativity of heterosexual able-bodiedness.</p>
<p>Disability, therefore, forms a crucial conceptual foundation in the way we experience and justify systems of inequality and membership/exclusion. It does so by producing disability as embodied limitation caused by imposing social barriers and labels that disadvantage particular people. Disability works ideologically to individualize and biologize dependence and “need,” treating disabilities as rare individual problems rather than conditions of everyday existence for all people. The assignment of disability thus serves as a broad justification to exclude a range of persons defined as unworthy for national membership and the exercise of rights (Baynton 2001). Consequently, the varied efforts by DS scholars, which began as an attempt to identify and theorize the inferior treatment of people with disabilities as citizens, have transformed the way we conceptualize citizenship for all people. This body of scholarship shows that the dichotomies of normal/abnormal, healthy/unhealthy, fit/unfit, and able/disabled underlie the very foundations of our systems of rights and our valuations of worth and membership (Carey 2009; Mitchell and Snyder 2001; Nielsen 2012).</p>
