				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the 2009 documentary film <em>Monica and David</em>, Monica, a woman with Down syndrome, is asked to define the word “handicap.” She responds, “When someone is in a wheelchair,” adding that the term may also apply to people who cannot hear or walk. “It’s a sickness,” she concludes. When presented with the same question, her husband, David (who also has Down syndrome), says he does not have a handicap. Asked if he has Down syndrome, he answers, “Sometimes.” In this brief exchange, Monica and David exemplify the challenges of defining disability as a coherent condition or category of identity. Yet David’s assertion that “sometimes” he has Down syndrome suggests that he understands a central tenet of disability studies: that disability is produced as much by environmental and social factors as it is by bodily conditions. While Down syndrome may prevent David from driving a car or managing his own finances, for example, his genetic condition is not a defining feature of his home and family life.</p>
<p>These insights by Monica and David remind us that the meanings we attribute to disability are shifting, elusive, and sometimes contradictory. Disability encompasses a broad range of bodily, cognitive, and sensory differences and capacities. It is more fluid than most other forms of identity in that it can potentially happen to anyone at any time, giving rise to the insiders’ acronym for the nondisabled, TAB (for temporarily able-bodied). As David suggests, disability can be situational; it can also wax and wane within any particular body. Disability brings together people who may not agree on a common definition or on how the category applies to themselves and others. Yet those same definitional challenges are precisely what make disability such a rich concept for scholars, activists, and artists. Because “disability” is this volume’s organizing term, it is important that we explore how it became attached to such diverse experiences and meanings, and produced such a wide range of social, political, and personal consequences.</p>
<p>The word “disability” has been part of the English language since at least the sixteenth century. According to the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>, the current sense of “a physical or mental condition that limits a person’s movements, senses, or activities [or] the fact or state of having such a condition” was first used in 1547. But the term also covered a broad range of “inabilities” or “incapacities” that included inability to pay a debt or to worship God with a full heart, while some conditions currently treated as disabilities were not regarded as such. Some—like autism or chronic fatigue syndrome—had not been discovered (or invented, depending on one’s perspective); others, like chronic pain or various disfigurements, were simply considered inevitable facts of life.</p>
<p>For much of its historical run, “disability” has brushed up against words like “infirmity” and “affliction,” both of which held connotations usually ascribed to disability today, as well as phenomena like poverty, ugliness, weakness, sickness, or simply subjection to an unfortunate experience (<a title="Baynton, Douglas C.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/baynton-douglas-c-se-3/">Baynton 2011</a>). Disability also shared ground with the early modern term “monstrosity” and the classical-era term “deformity”—the former having supernatural overtones and the latter representing a falling away from godliness into a particular kind of moral and physical ugliness (see Helen Deutsch’s entry on <a title="Deformity" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/essay/deformity/">“Deformity”</a> in this volume). By contrast, the word “cripple,” which derives from the idea of one who creeps, represented an attempt to characterize various physical impairments that impeded mobility. Similarly, “invalid” was an early medical shading of a broad range of infirmities resulting from injury or illness.</p>
<p>It was in the nineteenth century that disability became firmly linked, through the discourses of statistics, medicine, and law, to words such as “deviance,” “abnormality,” and “disorder.” <a title="Davis, Lennard J.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/davis-lennard-j-se-4/">Lennard Davis (1995)</a> argues that during this time the modern conception of disability emerged as a by-product of the concept of normalcy. Earlier human bodies were measured against idealized and often spiritual standards of perfection and ability that no earthly individual could match. With the development of statistical science and the bell curve, human ability came to be understood as a continuum, with disability and disabled people occupying the extreme and inferior end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, protecting the normal from the abnormal became a broad medical and social imperative undertaken in the name of progress. Vocabulary terms associated with disability reflect these shifts. Just as the eugenics movement attempted to rid the world of many disabilities through sterilization and segregation, disability terminology emphasized backwardness, atavism, and interruption: people with disabilities were said to be “slow,” “retarded,” or in a state of “arrested development.” Hereditary explanations stressed the degenerate threat disability posed to the white race. People with intellectual disabilities (classified under the broad term “feebleminded”), in particular, were said both to exemplify the debilitating effects of modernity and to represent instances of exceptional regression (<a title="Valente, Joseph." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/valente-joseph/">Valente 2013</a>). At a time when the industrialized world prized speed and efficiency, the temporal lag associated with disability amounted to being “handicapped in the race for life.”</p>
<p>Many of these terms remain as residual signifiers for disability in contemporary society. As Douglas Baynton argues, by the early twentieth century, one had only to say “handicapped” to indicate disability, while in France the primary translation for disabled remains <em>handicappé</em> (<a title="Baynton, Douglas C.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/baynton-douglas-c-se-3/">Baynton 2011;</a> <a title="Stiker, Henri-Jacques." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/stiker-henri-jacques/">Stiker 1999</a>). On a global scale, however, “disability” has now become the preferred term. It began its ascent in the United States during the Civil War, when “disability” measured one’s capacity to serve in the armed forces or one’s right to compensation from injuries incurred in military service. As the welfare state developed in the twentieth century, the term came to incorporate chronic illnesses and conditions of impairment that impeded one’s ability to work (<a title="Linker, Beth." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/linker-beth/">Linker 2013, 503–505</a>). But paradoxically, as “disability” has muscled out older competitors, it has also grown more ambiguous and unstable in its meanings. This is because as the term has expanded to include new categories of experience and perception as well as phenomena once labeled by other terms, those meanings have simultaneously been challenged by scholars and activists (<a title="Kudlick, Catherine J." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/kudlick-catherine-j/">Kudlick 2003</a>).</p>
<p>Although now someone with a visual impairment may recognize “disability” as the structure that links her to a wheelchair user or a person labeled as autistic, it thickens our sense of such alliances to study how people in earlier times understood—or, alternately, did not understand—their connections to each other. The historical record provides glimmers of cross-disability awareness but also of obstacles to finding common ground or shared values. A 1641 law in colonial Massachusetts, for instance, provided exemptions from public service for settlers who could claim “greatness of age, defect in mind, failing of senses, or impotency of Limbs” (<a title="Nielsen, Kim." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/nielsen-kim/">Nielsen 2012, 21</a>). Such unfitness for work ultimately led to organized systems of charity—and, by the nineteenth century, institutional quarantining and attempts at medical “correction” for people with a wide range of impairments.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, such quarantining sometimes promoted social cohesiveness within and even across different types of institutions. In nineteenth-century asylums and other specialized “total institutions,” blind and deaf people, people defined as mentally ill or deficient, and other disabled people often came into contact with large numbers of other members of their group for the first time. Thomas Gallaudet, the cofounder of the American Asylum for the Deaf, characterized the typical student at his school as “among his countrymen, for [they] use his native language.” Occasionally, this fellow feeling extended across categories of impairment. A patient-run literary journal published in a public nineteenth-century asylum for the insane, for example, records a visit by students from a school for the blind; another article in the journal speculates on the increased susceptibility of blind and deaf people to mental illness, showing an appreciation for the shared social vulnerability of all of these groups. Such institutional dispatches suggest a flickering awareness of institutionalization as the grounds for identifying a common set of experiences. Such connections were the grounds for political activism. Early American deaf-rights activist John Jacobus Flournoy, for instance, was one of the first to use the word “disability” in relation to deafness among a range of physical and mental differences when he wrote in 1855: “The old cry about the incapacity of men’s minds from physical disabilities, I think it were time, now in this intelligent age, to <em>explode</em>!” (<a title="Krentz, Christopher." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/krentz-christopher/">Krentz 2007, 155</a>).</p>
<p>As with segregation, colonialism, and apartheid, shared experiences of social separation and political disenfranchisement ultimately galvanized many people with disabilities and their supporters toward a common purpose. However, before the 1960s, politicized protests against the oppressive features of institutionalization and discrimination were scattered and generally did not speak for broad categories of disability. For instance, in the United States during the 1930s, when the League of the Physically Handicapped decried the Works Progress Administration’s policy of failing to employ people with physical disabilities, it did not include people with mental or developmental disabilities in its list of those who had suffered discrimination (<a title="Nielsen, Kim." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/nielsen-kim/">Nielsen 2012, 132</a>). And when the league approached leaders of the Deaf community to make common cause, they were rebuffed on the grounds that the Deaf were not disabled or unemployable (<a title="Burch, Susan." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/burch-susan/">Burch 2002, 126</a>). (Today, the Deaf community tends to regard deafness as a culture; whether it is also a “disability” is a contentious point.)</p>
<p>In this volume, the entry by Denise Nepveux on “Activism” tells how isolated protest movements cohered into the broad disability rights movement, which, by the late 1960s, was agitating for inclusion and access on many fronts, and which strengthened the sense of disability as a positive identity category rather than a stigmatized designation of inferiority or lack. Political organizing within the incipient disability rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s attempted to shift “disability” from an exclusively medical concern to a broadly social one, an effort that eventually won important battles. Major legislation and policy initiatives in the United States and worldwide reflect this shift, with profound implications for governments, businesses, and citizens—disabled and nondisabled alike. For example, the first two definitional prongs of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA; 1990; amended 2008) locate the meanings of disability within the body: “A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; a record of such an impairment.” These definitions are surprisingly similar to the long-standing dictionary definition of “a physical or mental condition that limits a person’s movements, senses, or activities” or “the fact or state of having such a condition.” However, the third definitional prong of the ADA, which adds “being regarded as having such an impairment,” put perceptions and social attitudes squarely in focus (<a title="Emens, Elizabeth F." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/emens-elizabeth-f/">Emens 2013</a>). The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2008) goes even further in defining disability’s social dimensions. Disability, according to the convention, “results from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinders their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.” Perhaps most expansively, the vision of accessibility propounded by Ron Mace and the universal design movement since the late 1980s was born out of a belief that particular physical or sensory differences only become disabling when the environment creates barriers to access. These recent developments all emphasize meanings of “disability” that are external to the body, encompassing systems of social organization, institutional practices, and environmental structures. Disability studies scholars refer to this approach as the “social model,” which challenges the medical understanding of disability as located exclusively in an individual body, requiring treatment, correction, or cure (<a title="Shakespeare, Tom.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/shakespeare-tom-se-3/">Shakespeare 2006b</a>).</p>
<p>Although the social model predominates, in much recent scholarship, disability refers to a subjective state, the condition not only of <em>identifying</em> as disabled but also of perceiving the world through a particular kind of lens. As <a title="Snyder, Sharon L." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/snyder-sharon-l-2/">Sharon Snyder and David Mitchell (2006)</a> note, narratives of disability history that focus on legislative triumphs, social inclusion, and the breakdown of stigma risk losing sight of the distinct, individual, and subjective experiences that make up disability’s history. Disability subjectivity, they argue, does not come either from bodily impairment or from the socially constructed world outside; instead, they argue for a “cultural model” of disability that explores the disabled body’s interface with the environments in which the body is situated. While it may be true that to lose one’s leg, or to be visually impaired, or to have a chronic illness in the twenty-first-century United States is incommensurate with what those impairments or conditions meant in eighteenth-century Europe or ancient Egypt, disability itself always begins and ends with the subjective impressions of the individual who experiences the world through her body. Despite the lingering popular sense that disability represents deficiency or defect of body or mind, the cultural (or, alternately, biocultural) model of disability as a relationship between body and society is gaining increasing legitimacy in law, policy, and the social environment worldwide.</p>
<p>Part of the transformation of “disability” from stigma and object of medical correction to source of knowledge reflects this new attention to inwardness. Disability becomes a mode of situating one’s understanding of self rather than a marker of isolation, what the late disability historian <a title="Longmore, Paul K.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/longmore-paul-k-se/">Paul Longmore (2003, 246)</a> called the “social death” sometimes experienced by people with disabilities. Whereas too often the experience of disability entered the historical record only through the words of those who tried to cure, tame, correct, or end it, disability studies scholarship is now focused on building—as well as excavating from the past—a rich and self-conscious record of the perspectives of disabled people themselves. Memoirs, films, journals, performance spaces, and online social networks promoting what is sometimes defiantly referred to as “crip” culture are all regular features of this new landscape of disability; meanwhile, academic conferences, journals, and degree programs have made disability studies a prominent force on many campuses. Such new developments parallel feminist epistemologies—including what used to be called “women’s way of knowing”—as well as postcolonial and critical race theorists’ critiques of hybrid identities and psychic displacements, and queer theory’s blending of social analysis and subjective expression. Each of these political-cultural-academic movements began with a first wave of identifying and resisting oppressive structures, which was followed by attempts to recover a cultural heritage as a backdrop for individual and collective expression in the present.</p>
<p>Intersectional modes of analysis point to the common interests, struggles, and pleasures these movements can promote. Deaf artist and activist <a title="Grigely, Joseph." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/grigely-joseph/">Joseph Grigely (2005)</a> works in this vein when he speaks of a “proactive” disability studies: one that is focused not just on attaining rights and accommodations for people with disabilities but also on developing dynamic, interactive, and collaborative projects that challenge the tyranny of “normal” in all areas of social and political life. To this end, the subjective experiences of people on the wrong side of “normal” can be used, in the words of the Dutch educational philosopher Pieter Verstraete, “to expose the self to the other,” rather than merely to “reduce the other to the self” (<a title="Verstraete, Pieter." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/verstraete-pieter/">2007, 63</a>). Vivid examples of this work of mutual “beholding” rather than objectifying “staring” can be found in <a title="Garland-Thomson, Rosemarie.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/garland-thomson-rosemarie-se-9/">Rosemarie Garland-Thomson’s (2009)</a> discussion of disabled artists who turn the unwanted attention of others into the subject of their own work.</p>
<p>While some scholars and activists claim or assume that disability is a category that cuts across cultures, others have noted that disability studies rests on assumptions derived from and specific to the Western world, and that its histories and archives continue to have a strongly Euro-American orientation. Disability scholarship and activism in Europe and North America have long sought independence for people with disabilities, a demand that arose in reaction against being treated as passive, voiceless, and dependent. In the 1970s, the independent living movement was born in Berkeley, California, and quickly took hold throughout the United States and Europe, with the goal of achieving greater autonomy and inclusion by providing people with disabilities with personal assistants and adaptive technology. However, as <a title="Kittay, Eva Feder.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/kittay-eva-feder-se/">Eva Kittay (1999)</a> has noted, largely overlooked in the quest for autonomy is the fact that the independence of disabled consumers is contingent on the labor of personal assistants who are almost always immigrant women, sometimes with unclaimed disabilities of their own. “Independence” and “autonomy” are concepts that are deeply embedded in the Western philosophical and political traditions of liberalism and are not universally desirable goals in all cultural contexts (<a title="Nussbaum, Martha C." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/nussbaum-martha-c/">Nussbaum 2006</a>).</p>
<p>The global ambitions of the universal design movement, which upholds the worthy goal of a barrier-free environment, also sometimes founder on the realities of global inequalities: this approach relies on architectural innovations and the use of technologies that may be too costly to be realistically implemented in many areas of the developing world. Moreover, the technologies that enable people with disabilities in the Western world are often manufactured by workers who cannot afford to use them, and who may themselves be disabled. For example, the smartphones and computer tablets that give students with disabilities in the West tools to learn alongside their nondisabled peers and that supply increasingly ingenious apps to allow blind, deaf, and mobility-impaired people to navigate their environments are likely to have been assembled under harsh and potentially disabling conditions in China. Michael Davidson argues that a more global disability studies must refine the concept of universal design to account for variations in resources and cultural values. In this way, disability studies can prompt us to consider how “many aspects of modernity are founded upon unequal valuation of some bodies over others” (<a title="Davidson, Michael." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/davidson-michael/">Davidson 2008, 171</a>).</p>
<p>Some scholars have offered the concept of “debility” as a supplement to disability, which they see as entangled with Western ideas about individuality, autonomy, and bodily integrity. The dictionary meaning of “debility” overlaps with “disability”: it is the “condition of being weak or feeble,” in either physical or mental capacity. But a secondary meaning—“political, social, or pecuniary weakness”—makes it useful for scholars attuned to populations made vulnerable by political and economic forces globally: For instance, Jasbir Puar uses the term to signify an “aggregate” condition in which some bodies worldwide are made to pay for “progress” that others enjoy. “Debility,” she writes, “is profitable for capitalism” (<a title="Puar, Jasbir." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/puar-jasbir/">2012, 153</a>). Like Puar, Julie Livingston uses the term “debility” to supplement the concept of disability and its attendant assumptions about a liberal, rights-based understanding of personhood. In Botswana, for instance, AIDS activists have sought the equal participation of persons with disabilities in the public sphere, but Livingston shows how the liberal model of personhood at the heart of their activism is undercut by Botswanan notions of moral sensibility, which include both an ethos of communal care and an intense aversion to certain types of bodily disfigurement or unruliness. While Euro-American versions of disability rights focus on “enabling persons to participate equally in rational-critical discourse in the public sphere regardless of the vagaries of any individual’s particular bodily state,” such goals collide with cultural systems that shape the circulation of bodies, emotions, and values differently (<a title="Livingston, Julie.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/livingston-julie-se/">Livingston 2008, 289</a>).</p>
<p>Obscuring these different constructions of disability and debility, human rights activists and policy makers around the world tend to idealize Western—and often specifically American—attitudes and practices concerning disability, while labeling those in the “developing” world as “backward” (<a title="Kim, Eunjung." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/kim-eunjung/">Kim 2011</a>). Certainly, the United States has done much to bring forward disability rights as a concept to be emulated elsewhere, but the social situation of people with disabilities is by no means uniformly secure. In the United States, health and physical beauty are marketed as commodities more aggressively than in any other culture. The rhetoric of the beauty, fashion, diet, and fitness industries, illustrated by the allure of cosmetic surgery, equates falling from these ideals with moral failure. So, too, in times of economic scarcity in the United States and other market-driven societies, people with disabilities and their supporters are often seen as a burden on public resources. Programs for education, transportation, and public services for people with disabilities are often the first to be cut by budget-conscious politicians. A backlash against civil rights accomplishments blames disability legislation for, in effect, “crippling” the economy. And many who claim accommodation or compensation under the law are viewed with suspicion of malingering—especially those whose disabilities are not immediately visible. The mapping of the human genome has also had ambivalent consequences for disability. Research that promises to cure or prevent disease and to bring new understanding of human character and potential often does little more than succeed in producing a new class of people whose genes tell us that they may someday become disabled by diseases like breast cancer, cystic fibrosis, or Huntington’s disease—thereby creating a pervasive anxiety about disability as a future risk. So, too, new technologies for prenatal testing seek to eliminate some types of genetic disability through the termination of fetuses. Such tests further stigmatize genetic conditions by making them seem like preventable mistakes. And in the eyes of many disability rights advocates, they augur a new era of eugenics, in which disability is eradicated before it comes into the world.</p>
<p>Our understanding of disability is enhanced by awareness of the term’s complex genealogy, as well as by the enormously varied experiences of embodiment across cultures and socioeconomic locations. If history is any indication, the meanings of disability and the words we use to describe its various manifestations will no doubt undergo profound shifts as a category of identity; a social, legal, and medical designation; and an embodied condition. As a way of perceiving the world, it will help us to understand—and to influence—the way that future takes shape.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scholars of disability studies (DS) who engage the topic of education tend to struggle with its chimerical nature: sometimes “schools” are abusive prisons, sometimes pathways toward greater social justice, and it is not always easy to tell the difference. While contemporary theories of DS education tend to point toward hopeful developments such as inclusivity and participatory design, scholars are also aware that certain features of asylums of the nineteenth century lingered in classrooms of the twentieth and even twenty-first centuries. This history and the wide variety of current educational theories lead DS scholars to conclude that “normality is a shifting social construction comprised of several competing interests” (<a title="Rogers, Rebecca, and Michael Mancini." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/rogers-rebecca-and-michael-mancini/">Rogers and Mancini 2010, 100</a>). Disability studies scholars and activists continue to debate just what those “competing interests” are, how they emerged historically, how their power should be addressed, and how positive change can be effected in educational settings.</p>
<p>In the modern West, disability has predominantly been figured as an individual, usually medical, “problem” that requires intervention and “cure.” As such, the classroom is often imagined as an important setting for those interventions and cures to take place. A medical/interventionist model of disability uses institutions of many kinds, including medical clinics, psychiatric hospitals and clinics, prisons, and schools, to effect a “solution” for disability. One strand of DS analysis focuses on the ways that different educational settings use the concept of disability in order to measure attributes such as intelligence, to track and predict performances in order to exploit the differences between “gifted” and “slow” students, and ultimately to achieve a variety of segregationist effects whose aim is to uphold existing power structures. In other words, “schooling operates as a field of application for disciplinary power” (<a title="Graham, Linda J." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/graham-linda-j/">Graham and Slee 2008, 282</a>).</p>
<p>To a large degree, the conflation of school with the site of “cure” has its origins in the asylum. Asylums existed before the 1800s, but it was during that century that these “total institutions” (<a title="Goffman, Erving." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/goffman-erving/">Goffman 1961</a>) helped shape the modern conception of disability as any human variation beyond the imagined normal. Some asylums were simply punitive, particularly when designated for nonwhite inmates (<a title="Burch, Susanand Hannah Joyner." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/burch-susan-and-hannah-joyner/">Burch and Joyner 2007</a>), but many claimed educational aspects. For example, insane asylums during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries claimed a progressive goal—to “repair those minds that had been broken by the modern world” (<a title="Reiss, Benjamin.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/reiss-benjamin-se/">Reiss 2008, 3;</a> see also <a title="Geller, Jeffrey L." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/geller-jeffrey-l/">Geller and Harris 1994</a>). This apparently benign goal, however, was attached to a coercive and even violent practice. While methods of “repair” did include schooling and vocational training, they also included painful, humiliating, and at times permanently damaging “treatments” such as physical restraint, forcible drugging (often through the use of laxatives), and—by the mid-twentieth century—sterilization, lobotomies, and electroshock. And the remediation itself was invariably aimed at aspects of human difference that presented some challenge to the status quo: for example, as feminist scholars have pointed out, asylums were often used as a means to incarcerate women who failed to meet accepted standards of “feminine” behavior.</p>
<p>Early asylums for the deaf, like insane asylums, were popularly considered nothing more than pens to house “dumb Animals” (<a title="Bulwer, John." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/bulwer-john/">John Bulwer,</a> qtd. in <a title="Wrigley, Owen." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/wrigley-owen/">Wrigley 1996, 2</a>). However, one significant difference in the trajectories of institutions for the d/Deaf and institutions for the mad is that in some cases deaf asylums morphed into schools for the d/Deaf. These became among the first institutional spaces in which Deaf and disability culture flourished. This was not a simple transition, however, since both asylums and schools were often places where “interest in cure and in exclusion coincide[d]” (<a title="Foucault, Michel.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/foucault-michel-se-5/">Foucault 1965, 10</a>). For example, while early “deaf and dumb” asylums in nineteenth-century Europe and the United Kingdom promoted sign language, later oralist “schools” for deaf children, established in an attempt to eradicate Deaf culture, were often cruelly abusive, using tactics such as tying students’ arms to their sides to prevent them from signing. Through the mid-1800s, however, Deaf culture continued to resist this oppression, and signing schools appeared in countries including France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Capital-D Deaf schools grew in number and popularity through the early twentieth century and foreshadowed the efforts of early twentieth-century schools to provide cultural and physical space for what would become radical organizing among advocates for disability and Deaf rights. Some of the efforts that emerged from schools included the establishment of the Rolling Quads in 1970 and the Center for Independent Living in 1972, both at the University of California at Berkeley, and the “Deaf President Now” protest at Gallaudet University in 1988.</p>
<p>Although (arguably) less violent than asylums, special education programs for students with a wide range of disability labels, developed through the middle to late twentieth century, were similarly aimed at both physical separation and discipline. In the United States, the emergence of special education as practiced today followed the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) of 1975. While these laws, and the programs that arose in response, were genuine attempts to increase accessibility, many problems resulted. Designating some forms of education as “special” meant that in practice schools became preoccupied with “classifying, labeling, and sorting so-called deviant behaviors” (<a title="Rogers, Rebecca, and Michael Mancini." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/rogers-rebecca-and-michael-mancini/">Rogers and Mancini 2010, 90</a>). Unsurprisingly, the deviance of disability overlaps with other categories of difference; for example, black males are vastly overrepresented in certain diagnostic categories, including ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder (<a title="Erevelles, Nirmala.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/erevelles-nirmala-se-2/">Erevelles 2005;</a> <a title="Rogers, Rebecca, and Michael Mancini." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/rogers-rebecca-and-michael-mancini/">Rogers and Mancini 2010;</a> <a title="Stubblefield, Anna.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/stubblefield-anna-se/">Stubblefield 2009</a>). Whether intentionally or not, programs in special education often uphold the oppression of particular groups of students—those who are perceived to deviate from an illusory norm—by casting their educational challenges as arising from “disability.”</p>
<p>In response to problems with the special education model, teachers and scholars began to move toward an “inclusion” model in the 1980s and 1990s. Inclusive education is meant to redress the segregationist qualities of special education. It represents an important philosophical shift, namely, the realization that separate educational experiences are rarely equal, and thus the creation of more flexible programs is needed. In practice, however, this goal is not always successful. One difficulty is that programs claiming to be inclusive may offer only “cosmetic adjustments” that preserve the status quo. (<a title="Graham, Linda J." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/graham-linda-j/">Graham and Slee 2008, 277–278</a>). Another problem is the vagueness of the term itself, which has been used to designate changed policies in settings as specific as classrooms, and as general as the educational system at large (<a title="Artiles, Alfredo J." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/artiles-alfredo-j-2/">Artiles, Kozleski, and Waitoller 2011, 3</a>). A somewhat more specific approach within inclusive education is “universal instructional design” (UID), sometimes also called “universal design for learning” (UDL) or simply “universal design” (UD). The “universal” part of the term is generally understood to be aspirational rather than descriptive: this approach sets as its ideal a learning environment that is accessible to all learning styles, abilities, and personalities but also acknowledges that such efforts must always be understood as partial and engaged in a process of continual revision.</p>
<p>Contemporary theories of education in DS are moving further away from the “universal” in UDL, even in name; some authors, such as <a title="Palmeri, Jason." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/palmeri-jason/">Palmeri (2006)</a>, instead are exploring “participatory design” (sometimes referred to as “human-centered” or “inclusive” design). This approach recognizes that the access needs of various users in a single space (whether physical or virtual) cannot be reliably predicted and may indeed conflict with one another; therefore, there can be no “one-size-fits-all” approach to creating accessible infrastructures. For example, scholars including Catherine Kudlick and Jay Dolmage have led efforts at conferences (the Society for Disability Studies and the Conference on College Composition and Communication, respectively) to demonstrate a crowdsourcing model of audio/visual description. In this model, the audience describes an image collaboratively, in real time; then discusses what elements of the image went unmentioned; and, finally, reflects on the political choice to leave some elements of a visual image “invisible” to an audience member who does not see it, or sees it differently from other audience members. The point of such presentations is to demonstrate that access measures such as captioning and image descriptions are not value-neutral but rather political and power-laden choices.</p>
<p>The future of disability education will be increasingly interdisciplinary, as “education” as a field of study incorporates principles from areas including architecture, communication, and human-computer interaction. At the same time, “disability” as an educational concept is broadening to include more emphasis on mental disability (<a title="Price, Margaret." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/price-margaret/">Price 2011;</a> <a title="Stubblefield, Anna.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/stubblefield-anna-se/">Stubblefield 2009</a>), as well as intersectional concerns including race and class (<a title="Artiles, Alfredo J." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/artiles-alfredo-j-2/">Artiles, Kozleski, and Waitoller 2011;</a> <a title="Erevelles, Nirmala.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/erevelles-nirmala-se-2/">Erevelles 2005</a>). While the promise of new approaches is always appealing, scholars and practitioners in disability education must also acknowledge the historical legacy of the asylum. Efforts in disability education must continually strive to avoid the oppressive and normalizing tendencies that endanger any institution, moving recursively toward the hope of a more just world.</p>

On the other, families are recognized as potential sites of repression, rejection, and infantilization. Whether seen positively or negatively, the term “family” is often taken for granted as a preordained, self-sufficient unit in discussions of family life influenced by disability. In the American context, the ideal of family generally involves parent-child relations in a classic heterosexual, nuclear, able-bodied household despite the coexistence of many other forms of family organization that incorporate members with disabilities: single parents, same-sex unions, extended family formations, and “families we choose.”</p>
<p>Some of the earliest and much ongoing work on disability and family life builds on this assumed heteronormative Euro-American nuclear form. This writing predominantly comes out of clinical and applied research in the “helping professions” addressing the inclusion of family members with disabilities. It also is evident in memoirs ranging from parental reflections on raising a child with a difference, to first-person chronicles of living with a disability, to activist accounts. More recently, disability studies scholars from different disciplines such as anthropology, philosophy, history, and literary studies have taken more analytic, critical, cross-cultural approaches to understanding how the social categories of “disability” and “family” inform each other.</p>
<p>We have proposed the term “kinship imaginary” as a way to underscore this new analytic perspective, emphasizing that families are both flesh-and-blood collaborations and always acts of cultural imagination (<a title="Rapp, Raynaand Faye D.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/rapp-rayna-and-faye-d-se/">Rapp and Ginsburg 2011</a>). This conception draws on the basic anthropological/historical recognition that families are social constructions that vary across class, culture, time, and geography. To rephrase an insight from Marx, <em>people make their own families but they do not make them as they please . . . but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past</em>. In the process of incorporating disability, family members often find themselves transforming seemingly stable notions of kinship that they themselves may have taken for granted, occasionally becoming “accidental activists” as a result (<a title="Silverman, Chloe." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/silverman-chloe/">Silverman 2011</a>).</p>
<p>Through much of the twentieth century, “family life” was an arena in which state policies and public culture defined and pathologized disability. As early as the 1860s, “ugly laws” prohibited citizens with disability from appearing in public space (<a title="Schweik, Susan.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/schweik-susan-se/">Schweik 2009</a>). By the early twentieth century, institutionalization of the disabled and eugenic measures both continued to purge disability from public space and “protected” the nuclear family. In the United States, discrimination against disability included the encouragement of passive infanticide and other eugenic ideologies that migrated to Nazi Germany, where murderous prejudice against disability escalated to genocide (<a title="Pernick, Martin S." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/pernick-martin-s/">Pernick 1996;</a> <a title="Longmore, Paul Kand Lauri Umansky." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/longmore-paul-k-2/">Longmore and Umansky 2001</a>). In much of the developed West, more mundane forms of bias against disability persisted well after World War II, as families were regularly encouraged to institutionalize their disabled children “for their own good” (<a title="Stern, Alexandra Minna." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/stern-alexandra-minna/">Stern 2005</a>).</p>
<p>Toward the end of the twentieth century, a change in the zeitgeist and the law began to favor inclusion of people with disabilities in families, schools, and communities, although discrimination continues to be an enormous problem. This shift in the kinship imaginary emerged from multiple processes: family activism, deinstitutionalization, progressive legal and educational reform, and most recently the growth of an international disability rights movement. As the relationship of people with disabilities to their natal families was redefined, kinship imaginaries have required continual reinvention, from the rearrangement of caretaking responsibilities in the household to the production of family narratives embracing rather than excluding the fact of disability (<a title="Groce, Nora Ellen." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/groce-nora-ellen/">Groce 1985</a>). This sort of “public storytelling” has worked its way into media of all sorts and in many parts of the world, ranging from personal memoirs and television shows to scholarly works that offer compelling perspectives on the “new normal” established by living life with a difference in many parts of the world (e.g., <a title="Grinker, Roy Richard." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/grinker-roy-richard/">Grinker 2007</a>).</p>
<p>A powerful redefinition of family through the prism of disability has come from feminist philosophers. Eva Kittay attends to “love’s labor,” the often unrecognized, mostly unremunerated, and deeply gendered work of caring for family members whose disabilities render them profoundly dependent, work inspired by her experiences providing care for a daughter, Sesha, born with severe cognitive impairment. <a title="Kittay, Eva Feder.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/kittay-eva-feder-se/">Kittay (1999)</a> develops a sophisticated analysis of the gendered assumptions built into our kinship imaginary via a “dependency critique” of equality as an ideology that hides the overwhelmingly female labor involved in caretaking of people with disabilities across the life span. She champions the recognition of caretaking labor that human dependency requires and the interdependence that characterizes all family life. <a title="Nussbaum, Martha C." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/nussbaum-martha-c/">Martha Nussbaum (2006)</a> also critiques theories of social justice built on ideologies of equal rational autonomous subjects. Instead, she proposes a legal philosophy that accounts for unequal capacity, asking how we can best extend the equal rights of citizenship to those with mental and physical disabilities.</p>
<p>The philosopher Peter Singer (<a title="Singer, Peter." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/singer-peter/">1993,</a> <a title="Singer, Peter.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/singer-peter-se/">1995</a>), by contrast, promotes an extreme utilitarian and neo-eugenic position, advocating that families have the choice to euthanize severely disabled newborns based on the hypothetical burden they might place on parents’ preferences for happiness. This position has been challenged by disability activists, notably in a widely circulated article by the late Harriet McBryde Johnson, a disability rights lawyer who sketches a primal family drama imagined from Singer’s philosophical perspective:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>He simply thinks it would have been better, all things considered, to have given my parents the option of killing the baby I once was, and to let other parents kill similar babies as they come along and thereby avoid the suffering that comes with lives like mine and satisfy the reasonable preferences of parents for a different kind of child. (<a title="Johnson, Harriet McBryde.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/johnson-harriet-mcbryde-se/">2003, 50</a>)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Add to Johnson’s voice anthropologist <a title="Landsman, Gail H." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/landsman-gail-h/">Gail Landsman’s (2009)</a> empirically grounded critique of Singer in her study of American mothers who were recently given a disability diagnosis for their infants. In analyzing changes in maternal narratives over several years, Landsman shows how these mothers struggled to transform the medical model into an alternative narrative of family life that readily encompasses disability.</p>
<p>New medical technologies have resurrected old questions about the status and stratification of disability in families. Since the 1970s, a burgeoning popular and scholarly literature has responded to the escalating number of genetic tests that are increasingly being used for “quality control” of anomalies present in both parents and fetuses. Feminist disability scholars have raised ethical issues about the cultural values that encourage termination of pregnancies—or not implanting embryos—with genetically diagnosed disabilities (<a title="Asch, Adrienne.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/asch-adrienne-se-3/">Asch 2007</a>). While the range of conditions available for testing is increasing geometrically, the fund of social knowledge accompanying such decision making—what it might be like to live with a particular disability—is woefully inadequate for a generation of women who face the dilemma of being “moral pioneers” (<a title="Rapp, Rayna." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/rapp-rayna/">Rapp 2000</a>).</p>
<p>While there are eugenic echoes in these practices, the “choice” regarding who is admitted to the human community has shifted from the state to the family, assisted by emergent expert professions such as genetic counseling. At the same time, however, the spread of disability consciousness has given greater support to couples with disabilities that choose to create families of their own. Additionally, medical technologies in the developed world have also increasingly provided lifesaving possibilities for compromised infants, those with spinal cord injuries, wounded soldiers, the frail elderly, and other disabled family members who might not otherwise have lived. Their survival brings new challenges to family reframed by the fact of disability.</p>
<p>In parts of the world where such medical technologies are rarely available, kinship imaginaries—as well as the very category of disability itself—have quite different configurations in diverse cultural and economic settings. While models of personhood focused on the individual have guided the scholarship on disability in the United States and other wealthy countries, kinship- and community-based supports in resource-poor and non-Western settings (where an estimated 80 percent of people with disabilities live) often grow out of radically interdependent understandings of personhood in which families—however they are defined—play a profoundly important role (<a title="Ingstad, Benedicte, and Susan Reynolds Whyte, eds." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/ingstad-benedicte-and-susan-reynolds-whyte-eds/">Ingstad and Whyte 2007</a>). In places such as China or India, the presence or absence of disability in familial life is constructed by broader notions of kinship and radically different epistemologies from those used in the West (<a title="Kohrman, Matthew." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/kohrman-matthew/">Kohrman 2005</a>). A condition such as epilepsy may be seen as a divine gift, or else as a rare genetic condition understood as an ancestral curse. Family members with disabilities may be hidden and silenced, integrated as laborers, or encouraged to migrate from villages to cities in search of education, work, or services (<a title="Phillips, Sarah D." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/phillips-sarah-d/">Phillips 2011</a>). By turning its attention to such contrastive kinship imaginaries, disability studies can aspire to a more global presence, offering a salutary recognition that people with disabilities everywhere shape and are shaped by family life in all its diversity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gender and disability, along with race, class, nationality, and sexuality, are constitutive features of the ways in which our fully integrated selves—what <a title="Price, Margaret." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/price-margaret/">Margaret Price (2011)</a> calls “bodyminds”—are lived and known. Gender has emerged as a key site of disability critique in four general areas: (1) sex, impairment, and the “realness” of the body; (2) the medicalization of gender; (3) the mutually reinforcing structures of gender and disability oppression; and (4) the reconfiguration of gender through disability experience. Thus, if disability theorists hope to understand and critique norms of bodily appearance and bodymind functioning, as well as offer meaningful alternative conceptions of the world and being, they must attend to how gender structures and is structured by those norms. Similarly, feminist and queer theorists cannot develop adequate accounts of gender without attending to the entanglement of the meaning and materialization of gender and disability.</p>
<p>Just as disability theorists have distinguished between impairment and disability, feminist theorists have distinguished between sex and gender. Sex refers to the chromosomal, anatomical, and physiological characteristics that mark the body as male, female, or intersex. Gender, by contrast, refers to socially, culturally, and historically contingent norms of appearance, bodily comportment, behavior, and desire that define what it means to be masculine, and thus a man, and feminine, and thus a woman. In this picture, those who queer gender norms, such as butches, femmes, trans-identified people, and other gender-transgressive people, fall along a gender continuum. Feminist and disability theorists have worked diligently to show how gender and disability are socially and culturally produced in order to combat the naturalization and regulation of “woman,” nonnormative gender, and disability. In oppressive contexts, naturalized conceptions of gender and disability operate to rationalize and normalize injustice against women, gender-transgressive people, and disabled people.</p>
<p>One consequence of sex-gender and impairment-disability distinctions is the relegation of sex and impairment to the body. Some feminist and disability theorists are concerned about the extent to which those distinctions lead to a devaluation of the material body, in particular purportedly real physical dimensions of gender and disability (<a title="Alaimo, Stacy, and Susan Hekman." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/alaimo-stacy-and-susan-hekman/">Alaimo and Hekman 2008;</a> <a title="Siebers, Tobin.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/siebers-tobin-se-2/">Siebers 2008a,</a> <a title="Siebers, Tobin.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/siebers-tobin-se-3/">2008b</a>). In defense of a “materialist turn” in feminism, Stacy Alaimo and Susan Hekman contend that focusing on ideology or representation alone neglects attention to, among other things, bodily pain and diseases that affect women’s “real” bodies (<a title="Alaimo, Stacy, and Susan Hekman." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/alaimo-stacy-and-susan-hekman/">2008, 3–4, 6</a>). For them, understanding the body and nature as produced by interactions between the material and the discursive (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/alaimo-stacy-and-susan-hekman/">7</a>) enables a more constructive critical attention to bodily conditions, like pregnancy, that must be acknowledged as sex-linked to a certain extent in order to understand them and provide access to the best care possible. This recent feminist turn to “the material” has a corollary in some disability discussions about pain and impairment. For example, Tobin Siebers argues for a realism about the disabled body that attends to the body’s agency and the “real” embodied lives of disabled people (<a title="Siebers, Tobin.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/siebers-tobin-se-3/">2008b, 67–68</a>).</p>
<p>Other feminist, queer, and disability theorists question the assumption that sex and impairment are mere facts of bodily materiality (<a title="Hall, Kim Q.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/hall-kim-q-se/">Hall 2005,</a> <a title="Hall, Kim Q." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/hall-kim-q/">2009;</a> <a title="Kafer, Alison." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/kafer-alison/">Kafer 2013;</a> <a title="Salamon, Gayle." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/salamon-gayle/">Salamon 2010</a>). As <a title="Salamon, Gayle." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/salamon-gayle/">Gayle Salamon (2010)</a> and<a title="Kafer, Alison." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/kafer-alison/"> Alison Kafer (2013)</a> point out, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what impairment and sex mean or how they are inhabited independent of the social and cultural context in which bodies are lived and assigned meaning. In addition, assuming the facticity of sex naturalizes binary understandings of sex and gender, which is often made possible by ignoring the lived bodily experience of gender-transgressive people (<a title="Salamon, Gayle." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/salamon-gayle/">Salamon 2010;</a> <a title="Spade, Dean." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/spade-dean/">Spade, “About Purportedly Gendered Body Parts”</a>). Among other negative consequences, naturalizing binary sex and gender often results in pathologizing gender-transgressive people and inhibits their access to health care.</p>
<p>Feminist theorists have rigorously critiqued the heteronormative gender bias that informs the medicalization of gender (<a title="Fausto-Sterling, Ann." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/fausto-sterling-ann/">Fausto-Sterling 2000;</a> <a title="Butler, Judithand Elizabeth Weed." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/butler-judith-and-elizabeth-weed/">Butler and Weed 2011</a>). As <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/fausto-sterling-ann/">Fausto-Sterling (2000, 3)</a> argues, the medical model relies on a flawed view of nature, and biomedical knowledge about sex difference reveals much more about dominant gender beliefs than about nature. The medical model conceptualizes disability, transgender, and intersex as problems in need of cure/elimination. In the case of intersex, “cure” involves surgical creation of binary sex; in the case of transgender, “cure” has involved sex reassignment surgery to fix gender identity disorder (GID). While trans people who desire sex reassignment surgery and hormone replacement therapy may not perceive these procedures as a cure for “misaligned” sex and gender, they have been forced to submit to a GID diagnosis in order to receive permission to access the medical services they need to exercise gender autonomy. The most recent edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (<em>DSM-5</em>), published in 2013, replaced GID with a new category, gender dysphoria (<a title="Beredjick, Camille." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/beredjick-camille/">Beredjick 2012</a>). The effects of this new diagnosis for gender-transgressive people remain to be seen. While many trans activists welcome the end of characterizing gender transgression as a disorder, they also wonder about the implications for legal advocacy because of the strategic use of the GID diagnosis in fighting discrimination against trans people (<a title="Beredjick, Camille." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/beredjick-camille/">Beredjick 2012</a>). Still, the introduction of gender dysphoria into the <em>DSM-5</em> does not signal an end to the medical regulation of gender.</p>
<p>In recognition of some degree of overlap between trans and disability experience, one can consider the successful, but fraught, use of state disability statutes in legal advocacy for trans rights. Like disability advocates, trans advocates can and have used state disability discrimination laws to locate the problems of exclusion and discrimination in the built and conceptual environment rather than in the bodies of trans people (<a title="Spade, Dean.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/spade-dean-se/">Spade 2003, 32–33</a>). Both disabled and trans people are stigmatized, a problem that can be addressed by changing dominant beliefs, attitudes, and environments, not by “curing”/eliminating nonnormative bodyminds.</p>
<p>Identifying the mutually reinforcing structures of gender and disability oppression involves understanding how other axes of identity, such as race, class, and sexuality, inform gender and disability. Spade’s use of the Americans with Disabilities Act in legal advocacy for trans rights is often on behalf of poor people and people of color who have no health insurance and are most vulnerable to regulation of myriad state institutions such as prisons and foster care systems. Eugenics and “eugenic logic” (<a title="Garland-Thomson, Rosemarie." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/garland-thomson-rosemarie/">Garland-Thomson 2012</a>) are also sites where gender, race, class, and sexuality oppression converge to the detriment of nonnormative bodyminds. <a title="Burch, Susanand Hannah Joyner." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/burch-susan-and-hannah-joyner/">Susan Burch and Hannah Joyner (2007)</a> describe the life of Junius Wilson, an African American deaf man born in North Carolina in 1908 and imprisoned in 1925 in the then-named State Hospital for the Colored Insane, where he was sterilized and castrated. Burch and Joyner explain how white racist mythologies of the black male rapist, along with Wilson’s inability to communicate with others because of his deafness (and because others could not comprehend his Raleigh signing), were used by white state authorities to diagnose Wilson as a sexual pervert and prescribe sterilization and castration as a cure (<a title="Burch, Susanand Hannah Joyner." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/burch-susan-and-hannah-joyner/">2007, 47</a>). Had Wilson been white, his experience would have been different. Historically, beliefs about gender have informed definitions of and treatments for mental disability. Thus, racialized, classed, and heteronormative gender regulation has been an important function of the diagnosis of mental disability (<a title="Carlson, Licia." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/carlson-licia/">Carlson 2001,</a> <a title="Carlson, Licia.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/carlson-licia-se/">2010;</a> <a title="Price, Margaret." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/price-margaret/">Price 2011</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to making visible and analyzing the interrelatedness of gender, race, class, disability, sexuality, and other axes of identity, feminist queer disability theorists understand how disability experience can be a site for critical reconfigurations of gender. While some disability theorists argue for recognition of disabled people as “real men” and “real women,” others have used disability as a critical resource through which to reimagine gender beyond heteronormative and able-bodied binaries. Embodying “normate” (<a title="Garland-Thomson, Rosemarie.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/garland-thomson-rosemarie-se-6/">Garland-Thomson 2011</a>) gender, for example, requires having a body whose appearance and capacity are in conformity with dominant gender norms (<a title="Garland-Thomson, Rosemarie.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/garland-thomson-rosemarie-se-6/">Garland-Thomson 2011;</a> <a title="James, Jennifer C." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/james-jennifer-c/">James 2011;</a> <a title="Mintz, Susannah B." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/mintz-susannah-b/">Mintz 2011;</a> <a title="Serlin, David." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/serlin-david/">Serlin 2003</a>). <a title="Finkelstein, S." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/finkelstein-s/">Naomi Finkelstein (2003, 311)</a> describes feeling “emasculated” by fibromyalgia–rheumatoid arthritis while also understanding it as an experience that enables reconfiguring what it means to be butch. Being a “crip butch” reconfigures masculinity as openness to vulnerability and simultaneously exposes cracks in narrow gender norms (<a title="Finkelstein, S." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/finkelstein-s/">317</a>). Similarly, <a title="Clare, Eli." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/clare-eli/">Eli Clare (1999)</a> writes about the complex process of trying to reclaim one’s gendered disabled body, a process that involves negotiating categories like “woman” and “tomboy” that don’t quite fit, as well as urban markers of gender that leave no room for white, working-class, rural gender-transgressive experience.</p>
<p>While feminist insights about gender have been useful for disability theorists, disability studies, especially in its feminist, queer, and crip incarnations, promises to transform understandings of gender. Indeed, in its critique of heteronormative gender, feminist and queer disability studies crips gender (<a title="Sandahl, Carrie.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/sandahl-carrie-se/">Sandahl 2003;</a> <a title="McRuer, Robert.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/mcruer-robert-se-2/">McRuer 2006</a>), creating an opening for the emergence of another world and more capacious, democratic ways of being in it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Identity is the idea of the self understood within and against the social context, a means by which the individual is categorized and located as part of, or set apart from, recognized social, political, and cultural groups. As “the means by which the person comes to join a particular social body” (<a title="Siebers, Tobin" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/siebers-tobin-se-3/">Siebers 2008b, 15</a>), identity is a symbolic performance, an activity that names and aligns the self, by which the individual is composed as socially significant. It cannot exist, therefore, except in social relief—against a backdrop by which the self is made visible to both self and other. Disability identity has a complex and dynamic history. At its core is the disability rights movement, which for the first time asserted disability as a minority identity and as a platform for collective political action. In the entry on “Minority” in this volume, Jeffrey Brune indicates that Louis Anthony Dexter and Erving Goffman laid the groundwork for understanding disability in political terms in the early 1960s. Activists like Ed Roberts, Paul Longmore, Justin Dart, Judith Heumann, and others, however, were instrumental in developing and acting on this foundation. Fighting institutionalized political, social, and economic discrimination, such activists not only impacted public policy but also shifted and helped to shape a disability community, galvanizing a diverse and diffuse population of disabled people and helping to forge what many have come to understand as disability identity. This politicized identity is grounded in the idea that disability is a socially constructed category, an identity that is shaped by cultural and historical forces rather than being determined primarily by the body.</p>
<p>Viewing disability as a social construction has been a crucial political concept, a mode of resistance to the pejorative constructs of the social majority and received forms of knowledge that insist on disability exclusively as a medical condition or fact of the body. Simi Linton advocates strongly for this constructionist position in <em>Claiming Disability</em>, observing that people with disabilities are “bound together . . . by the social and political circumstances that have forged us as a group” and referring to group alliance as leading to “civil rights victories and the foundation of a clearly identified disabled community” (<a title="Linton, Simi." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/linton-simi/">1998, 4, 5</a>). Tobin Siebers argues for the centrality of “identity politics . . . to the future of minority peoples and their quest for social justice and inclusion” (<a title="Siebers, Tobin.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/siebers-tobin-se-3/">2008b, 17</a>). Understanding disability as a social construct and disability identity as politically constituted are foundational for disability theory and culture, baseline concepts upon which all other thinking and writing about disability identity must be measured.</p>
<p>Historically, disability has been passively constructed by clinical, literary, and social discourses that demean, disparage, and pathologize. The long-standing “medical model” of disability locates disability exclusively in the body, seeing the body as deviant, broken, and in need of a cure performed by nondisabled agents. This model likewise categorizes people with disabilities according to impairments, making it hard for a blind or deaf person to imagine common ground with an amputee, or a person with mental illness or an intellectual disability. Likewise, the charity model of disability seeks to “cure” disability through interventions like fund-raising, which often perpetuate negative stereotypes that interfere with self-determination (<a title="Kemp, Evan, Jr." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/kemp-evan-jr/">Kemp 1981</a>). Pursuing a long-standing thread in literary disability studies, <a title="Mitchell, David T.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/mitchell-david-t-se-2/">David Mitchell and Sharon Snyder’s <em>Narrative Prosthesis</em> (2000)</a> observes that in literature and other forms of imaginative representation, disability has long been associated with malevolence and corruption. It is essential that the development of the social model, upon which modern concepts of disability identity are constructed, continue to be understood in terms of this preexisting multitude of damaging ableist narratives that continue to inform public discourse about disability identity.</p>
<p>Even as the paradigm of disability identity shifts from the passive construction of disability as “problem” to be fixed to a model in which disabled people increasingly understand themselves and are understood by others as political and social agents, disability theorists and activists have continued to challenge emerging conventions. Some have alleged that disability identity itself is coercive and essentialist, as well as being grounded in narratives of oppression. In response to these critiques, scholars have developed critical perspectives that recognize disability identity as multiple, fragmented, and complex. Indeed, Lennard Davis suggests that “the unstable nature of disability . . . spells the end of many identity groups,” including disability itself, and that these shifting boundaries are the hallmark of postmodern identity, creating “a dismodernist approach to disability as a neoidentity” (<a title="Davis, Lennard J." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/davis-lennard-j/">2002, 26</a>). Mindful of key philosophical discourses of the body, Davis’s “dismodernism” is ultimately rooted in Donna Haraway’s influential “Cyborg Manifesto” (originally published in 1985), which asserts that “we are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism,” and that we ought to take “pleasure in the confusion of boundaries” (<a title="Haraway, Donna." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/haraway-donna/">1991, 150</a>). But, while such thinking has had a powerful impact on disability theory, not all scholars are ready to deconstruct disability identity, or identity politics in general. Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, for instance, suggests that while ongoing debates in disability studies are sometimes predicated on the “reductive notion that identity studies are intellectual ghettos limited to a narrow constituency,” that is no reason to reject them altogether. She points out that some of the “most sophisticated and nuanced analyses of disability” come “from scholars conversant with feminist theory” (<a title="Garland-Thomson, Rosemarie.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/garland-thomson-rosemarie-se-6/">2011, 14</a>), which has a more expansive tradition of “collaborative, interdisciplinary inquiry and a self-conscious cultural critique that interrogates how subjects are multiply interpellated” (<a title="Garland-Thomson, Rosemarie.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/garland-thomson-rosemarie-se-6/">15</a>). And while Davis calls attention to the extreme porousness of disability as an identity category, Siebers argues for the importance of “identity politics as crucial to the future of minority peoples.” He calls for a theory of “complex embodiment” that recognizes how bodies and bodily experience structure social experience as much as bodies are subject to existing social frameworks (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/siebers-tobin-se-3/">Siebers 2008b, 17</a>).</p>
<p>Looking forward, disability identity is also increasingly interlaced with other ongoing social, political, and academic explorations. Disability scholars and activists, redressing the early limits of disability studies, are working within critical studies of race and ethnicity and global and postcolonial studies frameworks to expand and complicate ideas of disability identity. Mainstream conversations about biopolitics, including debates about prenatal testing, selective abortion, gene therapies, eugenics, and other emerging technologies of the body, are deeply inflected by the presence of disability and are increasingly overlapping and intersecting with issues of disability identity. Thus, what Siebers might recognize as “complex embodiment” is becoming a more central subject of public and academic discourse. Despite more sophisticated approaches and a more significant role in public discourse, however, the complex sense of disability identity outlined here does not yet occupy a secure place in the public imagination. And early work by disability scholars and activists—those who first identified and agitated against the structural inequities of ableist social institutions—continues to play an important role in shaping the future of disability identity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Historically, the term “queer” was a stigmatizing label that often included disabled people in its purview. A century ago, for instance, someone with a missing limb or a cognitive impairment might be called “queer.” In recent decades, sexual minorities have reclaimed “queer” as a badge of pride and a mark of resistance to regimes of the normal, mirroring the embrace of terms like “crip” and the capaciousness of the term “disability” itself. These are all political, highly contested terms that refuse essentializing meanings. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the activist group Queer Nation’s chant “We’re here, we’re queer, get used to it” was historically concurrent with the disability rights activist slogan “Not dead yet.”</p>
<p>What the field of queer studies shares most fundamentally with disability studies is a critique of the effects of normalization on embodiment, desire, and access. “Queer” opposes not heterosexuality but <em>heteronormativity</em>—the often unspoken assumption that heterosexuality provides the framework through which everything makes sense. Before Michael Warner invented the term “heteronormativity” in the early 1990s, scholars had been working with a notion of “compulsory heterosexuality” coined by the lesbian feminist writer <a title="Rich, Adrienne." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/rich-adrienne/">Adrienne Rich (1983)</a>. Disability theorist Robert McRuer picked up Rich’s account two decades later in order to argue that compulsory heterosexuality depends upon compulsory able-bodiedness, since heteronormativity assumes first and foremost that sexual subjects must be able-bodied, healthy, and therefore “normal.” Indeed, able-bodiedness appears to be even more compulsory than heterosexuality because the latter requires the former. Normal sex—as opposed to its deviant or perverse forms—requires a normal body. Articulating disability theory with queer theory, <a title="McRuer, Robert.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/mcruer-robert-se-2/">McRuer (2006)</a> thus developed a “crip theory” in which a critique of sexual normalization goes hand in hand with a critique of ableist assumptions about embodiment.</p>
<p>Critiques of normalization have a substantial history in the fields of both disability studies and queer studies. Indeed, those critiques generated their own critical terminology in their respective areas of humanities scholarship during the 1990s. In addition to Warner’s coinage of “heteronormativity,” Rosemarie Garland-Thomson deployed the concept of the “normate” in her influential book <em>Extraordinary Bodies</em> to designate “the social figure through which people can represent themselves as definitive human beings” (<a title="Garland-Thomson, Rosemarie.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/garland-thomson-rosemarie-se-2/">1997, 8</a>). Similarly, <a title="Davis, Lennard J.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/davis-lennard-j-se-4/">Lennard Davis’s <em>Enforcing Normalcy</em> (1995)</a> described the cultural processes that perpetuate exclusionary corporeal norms and ideals. As with Warner’s critique of heteronormativity, the central claim of this area of scholarship is that, beyond examining the bodily conditions or the physical environments that produce disability, disability studies should also examine those less tangible but profoundly distorted social expectations that presume what bodies should look like and be able to do.</p>
<p>Queer approaches to thinking about disability and sexuality argue that neither the human body nor its capacities are biologically determined; rather, both disability and sexuality are constituted via sociocultural processes of normalization. Sociologist <a title="Goffman, Erving.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/goffman-erving-se-2/">Erving Goffman’s <em>Stigma</em> (1963)</a>, for instance, influenced both disability studies and queer studies, in part because Goffman routinely refers to “cripples” and “homosexuals” in the same breath, as parallel examples of stigmatized identities. What remains crucial in Goffman’s account is his insight that everyone falls short of identity norms; we are all potentially vulnerable to the injurious effects of social stigma. In other words, normalization does not exclusively bolster the interests of the so-called normal, since it also puts them at risk. Insofar as “queer” and “disabled” designate contingent identities, anyone can be queered or become disabled by failing to live up to particular norms or ideals.</p>
<p>The influential philosopher Michel Foucault broadens the scope of Goffman’s sociological analysis by showing that power in modern society is exerted less through the channels of regulation and prohibition than through those of normalization and rehabilitation. Foucault’s critique of normalization derives, in part, from the work of French medical historian Georges Canguilhem, whose study <a title="Canguilhem, Georges." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/canguilhem-georges/"><em>The Normal and the Pathological</em> (1978)</a> demonstrated that illness is routinely yet erroneously understood in terms of its departure from biophysical norms. Canguilhem’s point was that significant variations from what is statistically normal for a population need not imply pathology. Only when mathematical norms get conflated with evaluative norms do such variations indicate sickness. This distinction between statistical and evaluative norms, which has been indispensable for the strand of queer theory developed by Warner, is also highly relevant for disability studies. In both queer theory and disability theory, the demystification of social categories as well as medical metrics helps to highlight the ways in which illness, health, and normality are constructed.</p>
<p>Nowhere have social and medical norms intersected so powerfully as with the phenomenon of AIDS. As literary scholar Ellis Hanson has contended, “Queer theory itself may be said to have begun as disability studies, sparked as it was by activist energies around the AIDS crisis” (<a title="Hanson, Ellis." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/hanson-ellis/">2011, 113</a>). Queer politics grew out of the AIDS activism of the late 1980s, largely in order to insist that AIDS is not a disease of identity—that is, a disease pertaining only to pathologized social groups such as gay men or IV drug users. Among its many effects, the AIDS epidemic fostered a coalitional politics that cut across established lines of sexual, racial, and disabled identity, resulting in a specifically queer politics.</p>
<p>Disability studies may have catalyzed the origins of what scholars now think of as queer studies. But it is only once the two have been explicitly articulated relative to one another that the extent of their connection becomes clear. The connection enables literary scholar Anna Mollow to suggest that sex itself, in its effects on coherent selfhood, may be regarded as disabling. Drawing on a psychoanalytic strand of queer theory associated with Leo Bersani, Mollow argues that “disability” and “sex” represent “two names for the same self-rupturing force” (<a title="Mollow, Anna." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/mollow-anna/">2012, 287</a>). Here the connection between queer and disability stems not from social processes of normalization but from the impact of sexual intensity on bodily coherence. Mollow’s challenging hypothesis points toward a possible future for queer theory and disability studies by rethinking the extent of their mutual interdependence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Race and disability, two significant categories of difference that shape the social, have often been conceptualized as analogous to each other. Disability has often been described as being “like race” and race as being “like disability” in attempts to shift the experience of disability from the debilitating conceptual space of individual pathology to a broader social recognition of disabled people as members of a political minority. Thus, for example, <a title="Garland-Thomson, Rosemarie.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/garland-thomson-rosemarie-se-2/">Rosemarie Garland-Thomson (1997)</a> describes disability as a “form of ethnicity” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/garland-thomson-rosemarie-se-2/">6</a>), while <a title="Davis, Lennard J.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/davis-lennard-j-se-4/">Lennard Davis (1995)</a> maps similarities between the disabled body and “the body marked as differently pigmented” (<a title="Davis, Lennard J.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/davis-lennard-j-se-4/">80</a>). Foregrounding this analogous relationship between race and disability has helped propel the disability rights movement and disability studies scholarship forward into an alternative space of empowering possibility.</p>
<p>In the field of critical race studies, however, there are few echoes of a similar reciprocity with regard to disability. The act of correlating race and disability is often fraught with violent and oppressive overtones. For example, the historian <a title="Baynton, Douglas C." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/baynton-douglas-c/">Douglas Baynton (2001)</a> has noted that “non-white races were routinely connected to people with disabilities . . . [and] depicted as evolutionary laggards or throwbacks” (<a title="Baynton, Douglas C." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/baynton-douglas-c/">36</a>) to justify discrimination based on embodied difference from a mythical norm. Literary theorist <a title="Spillers, Hortense J." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/spillers-hortense-j/">Hortense Spillers (1987)</a> documents the unimaginable brutality of such discrimination when she describes how the representational and physical violence meted out to the black captive body during the Middle Passage and slavery enabled the slave’s body to become a site where the battered flesh (disability) was transformed into the prime commodity of exchange in a violent conflation of profit and pleasure (<a title="Erevelles, Nirmala." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/erevelles-nirmala/">Erevelles 2011</a>).</p>
<p>These oppressive overtones continued to echo from within the Enlightenment discourses of the early eighteenth century and much of the nineteenth century, where philosophers like Hume and Kant utilized the analogy between race and disability to distinguish among “different breeds of men.” Buttressed by an emerging science that proposed linkages between human anatomy and human capability (and, later, for Freud, the notion that “anatomy is destiny”), the racist practice of eugenic sterilization or selective breeding was institutionalized (<a title="Mitchell, David T." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/mitchell-david-t/">Mitchell and Snyder 2003</a>). Eugenic science sought to stem the threat of degeneration by controlling the reproduction of those designated as “feebleminded,” which was fueled in part by the social and economic upheavals caused by industrialization. By the early twentieth century, the concept of feeblemindedness came to operate as an umbrella term that linked ethnicity, poverty, and gendered and racialized conceptions of immorality together as “the signifier of tainted whiteness” (<a title="Stubblefield, Anna." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/stubblefield-anna/">Stubblefield 2007, 162</a>). The fear of degeneracy associated with a “tainted whiteness” extended not only to Jewish Americans, African Americans, Puerto Ricans, Mexican Americans, Asian Americans, and American Indian women but also to lower-class white women based on their assumed shared “biological” inferiority and their reproductive incapacity to bear children that would assimilate into mainstream white society.</p>
<p><a title="Mitchell, David T." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/mitchell-david-t/">Mitchell and Snyder (2003)</a> argue that it is necessary to recognize eugenics as a transatlantic cultural exchange—what they call the “eugenic Atlantic”—to mark how the discourse of disability was deployed throughout the European colonial diaspora. In this context, the concept of disability justified oppressive social, political, cultural, and economic policies based on the argument that racial difference and class inequalities represented pathological defects otherwise known as “disability.” These ideologies of disability enabled European expansionists to justify the conquest of racialized others while simultaneously retrieving “an unspoiled, pre-modern version of an ever more complex western self” (<a title="Mitchell, David T." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/mitchell-david-t/">848</a>). With its commitment to a doctrine of human purity, eugenic science continued to erase the “histories, bodies, [and]/or cultures” (<a title="Jarman, Michelle." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/jarman-michelle/">Jarman 2006, 149–150</a>) of despised Others, as manifested in “protective” practices like genocide, forced sterilizations, rigid miscegenation laws, and residential segregation in ghettos, barrios, reservations, and state institutions like prisons and asylums.</p>
<p>In an ironic twist, the very same pathologized bodies made to disappear from polite society via regulatory or eugenic practices were rendered highly visible as “freaks” and transformed into spectacles for popular consumption and economic profit (<a title="James, Jennifer C." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/james-jennifer-c-2/">James and Wu 2006;</a> <a title="Adams, Rachel." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/adams-rachel/">Adams 2001;</a> <a title="Garland-Thomson, Rosemarie.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/garland-thomson-rosemarie-se-2/">Garland-Thomson 1997</a>). For instance, the public’s morbid fascination with the sexualized bodies of Saartjie Baartman, the South African woman known as the “Hottentot Venus,” or other racialized freaks such as Ota Benga, and Hiram and Barney Davis, “the Wild Men of Borneo,” was proof of the brutal conflation of race and disability. Such racial freaks were collectively represented to the public as the unbearable physical excesses that had to be shed to confer entry into the realm of normalcy (<a title="Adams, Rachel." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/adams-rachel/">Adams 2001</a>). Thus, for example, both scientists and policy makers involved in the “eugenic Atlantic” and proprietors and showmen involved in the freak show circuit presumed that it was the “natural” deviance of disability ascribed to the racialized body that constituted it as either the despised Other or the profitable freak. In both cases, science and entertainment referenced “‘race’ as the social locus of ascribed insufficiency while leaving disability as the default category of ‘real’ human incapacity” (<a title="Mitchell, David T." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/mitchell-david-t/">Mitchell and Snyder 2003, 851</a>).</p>
<p>Given this history, it has been difficult for critical race scholars to conceptually engage with the category of disability beyond the simplistic and problematic assertion that there is an analogous relationship between race and disability. Claiming that “race is like disability” or that “disability is like race” does nothing to engage the complex ways in which race and disability are imbricated in the construction of the pathological Other. For example, when disability is invoked in critical discourses of race, it usually suffers from what <a title="Ewart, Chris." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/ewart-chris/">Chris Ewart (2010)</a> has described as <em>dis</em>appropriation. Here disability is used “to affirm (an often subordinate) voice to elucidate agency and figurative empathy for other oppressed and exploited populations” (<a title="Ewart, Chris." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/ewart-chris/">152</a>). Used in this context, critical race scholars, such as Stuart Hall, have described the life experiences of a racialized subject as “crippling” and “deforming.” In doing so, they fail to recognize that, rather than rejecting oppressive biological criteria, they unwittingly reaffirm an imagined biological wholeness (normativity) that was instrumental in the propagation of the same oppressive ideologies they were seeking to dismantle in the first place (<a title="Erevelles, Nirmala." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/erevelles-nirmala/">Erevelles 2011</a>). They inadvertently deploy disability as a master trope of disqualification that one should escape rather than embrace.</p>
<p>Rather than treating the analogous relationship between race and disability as prosthetic metaphor and/or nuanced intervention, it may be necessary to engage the historical contexts and structural conditions within which the identity categories of race and disability intersect. For example, special education classes became the spaces where African American and Latino students were ghettoized even after the <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> legislation, which was supposed to make segregation on the basis of race in education unacceptable (<a title="Connor, David J." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/connor-david-j/">Connor and Ferri 2005;</a> <a title="Artiles, Alfredo J." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/artiles-alfredo-j/">Artiles 2011</a>). But in recognizing the conjunction of race and disability rather than highlighting only one or the other, race and disability become clearly interdependent as disabled subjectivities are racialized and racialized subjects are disabled simultaneously. <a title="Blanchett, Wanda J." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/blanchett-wanda-j/">Blanchett, Klingner, and Harry (2009)</a> have illustrated how the politics of race, class, and disability intersect when students of color in low-income, high-poverty schools “become” mildly mentally retarded and emotionally disturbed. Even when compensatory services are available, white privilege and institutional racism obstruct access to these services. Additionally, these students of color find themselves in the most segregated and punitive spaces in the public school system—social conditions that often extend into their adult lives via the school-to-prison pipeline (<a title="Erevelles, Nirmala." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/erevelles-nirmala/">Erevelles 2011</a>). Thus, in the historical context of <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>, the oppressive practices of white supremacy and pedagogical ableism were mutually constitutive.</p>
<p>Social conditions of poverty also contribute to racialized subjects “becoming” disabled. The incidence of physical and mental illness in people of color communities, for instance, differs drastically from that of their white counterparts. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, African American children are disproportionately more likely to suffer from exposure to lead and toxic waste, well-known causes of developmental delays, because they are disproportionately more likely to live in old and run-down housing with lead pipes and peeling lead paint near hazardous waste sites (<a title="Stubblefield, Anna.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/stubblefield-anna-se/">Stubblefield 2009;</a> <a title="Erevelles, Nirmala." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/erevelles-nirmala/">Erevelles 2011</a>). Furthermore, people of color, especially African Americans, are less likely to be diagnosed with depression or prescribed medication when they report symptoms to a doctor, and are also institutionalized involuntarily more often, in part because racial stereotypes affect psychiatrists’ assessments of their “dangerousness” (<a title="Mollow, Anna.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/mollow-anna-se/">Mollow 2006, 74;</a> <a title="Metzl, Jonathan." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/metzl-jonathan/">Metzl 2011</a>). Extending beyond the local context of the United States, in neocolonial and postcolonial contexts, war and intra-ethnic strife create actual physical disabilities as well as trauma in societies where there are few economic, social, and emotional supports. Race drastically transforms the life experience of becoming disabled and living with disability in both historical and contemporary contexts.</p>
<p>While it may be politically expedient for disability studies scholars to argue that disability is the most universal of human conditions because almost anyone can become disabled (<a title="Garland-Thomson, Rosemarie.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/garland-thomson-rosemarie-se-2/">Garland-Thomson 1997</a>), there is often an implicit assumption that the acquisition of a disabled identity always occurs outside historical context. But rather than conceiving of “disability” and “race” as interchangeable tropes in order to foreground the ubiquity of oppression, the categories of race/ethnicity and disability might be better invoked to demonstrate how they constitute one another through social, political, economic, and cultural practices that have kept seemingly different groups of people in strikingly similar marginalized positions (<a title="James, Jennifer C." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/james-jennifer-c-2/">James and Wu 2006;</a> <a title="Erevelles, Nirmala." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/erevelles-nirmala/">Erevelles 2011</a>). Thus, more robust and complex analyses of race and disability are necessary for us to move beyond the initial conceptual space of analogy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The history of the keyword “sexuality” is inextricably interwoven with the history of a range of other disability keywords, including “freakish,” “innocent,” and—most important—“normal” and “abnormal.” As philosopher Michel Foucault has demonstrated, for the past few centuries, we have inhabited a culture of “normalization” that categorizes individuals and populations, marking certain bodies (for instance, those understood as disabled, ill, or lacking) <em>and</em> certain desires (for instance, those understood as perverse, queer, or mad) as “abnormal.” Systems of surveillance, control, intervention, incarceration, correction, or “cure”—what <a title="Foucault, Michel." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/foucault-michel/">Foucault (2003)</a> would describe as “technologies of normalization” administered by authorities assumed to possess “expert opinion”—emerged in the eighteenth century and intensified over the course of the nineteenth to facilitate this categorization. Sexuality was one of the most distinct areas of social life to succumb to these systems of control and cure.</p>
<p>In the first volume of his book <a title="Foucault, Michel.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/foucault-michel-se-4/"><em>The History of Sexuality</em> (1978)</a>, Foucault argued that a widespread belief emerged by the late nineteenth century that sexuality was simply “repressed” and in need of “liberation.” <em>The History of Sexuality</em> worked to challenge this truism and illuminate the ways in which the contours of “sexuality” were clearly visible <em>within</em> a history of normalization (rather than beyond, in some imagined future when “repression” would have supposedly withered away). Foucault thus excavated how “sexuality” experienced an “incitement to discourse”: far from being (simply) repressed, in other words, sexuality was endlessly talked about, managed, pathologized, and (often) “corrected.”</p>
<p>Although disability is not one of Foucault’s topics in <em>The History of Sexuality</em>, his discussion of sexuality as a product of endless discourse could also be true of “ability.” Through what Foucault understood as a “proliferation of discourses,” “ability” and “disability,” like “sexuality,” materialized as supposedly knowable entities. The emergence and naturalization of these discourses positioned sexuality and ability not only as culturally and historically specific modes of experience but also as cross-temporal and in some cases even universal components of what it means to be a human being. The naturalization of sexuality and ability both privileged and linked what eventually came to be understood as “able-bodiedness” and “heterosexuality” (<a title="McRuer, Robert.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/mcruer-robert-se/">McRuer 2002</a>). For instance, professional psychologists and sexologists (most notoriously, Richard von Krafft-Ebing and his study <em>Psychopathia Sexualis</em> [1886]) pathologized homosexuality and other perversions, linking them to a wide array of physical and mental impairments or disabilities.</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, historians of sexuality such as <a title="DEmilio, John." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/demilio-john/">John D’Emilio (1983)</a> have more specifically demonstrated the ways in which the processes of putting sexuality into discourse produced a binary system of understanding human sexuality that ultimately privileged “heterosexuality” and subordinated “homosexuality” and other so-called perversions. The sexualities known as “heterosexual” and “homosexual,” then, are not somehow timeless and natural but socially constructed or “invented” (<a title="Katz, Jonathan Ned." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/katz-jonathan-ned/">Katz 1990</a>). In his influential essay <a title="DEmilio, John." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/demilio-john/">“Capitalism and Gay Identity” (1983)</a>, D’Emilio tied this invention of sexuality to the history of industrial capitalism, arguing that as work (for men and some women) became increasingly associated with a “public” space outside the home, a homosexual or gay identity became available to certain people who discovered each other in “homosexual” locations (bars, clubs, bathhouses) that emerged throughout the West. The home, meanwhile, was no longer understood primarily as a space where inhabitants worked together for survival but rather as an ideological (private and newly “heterosexual”) space where one could expect to find happiness and respite from the public world of work. This new heterosexual space was also arguably able-bodied as well, as “disability” was purged from the home (<a title="McRuer, Robert.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/mcruer-robert-se-2/">McRuer 2006</a>). Rates of institutionalization (removal from private home spaces) skyrocketed by more than 1500 percent, for instance, between 1870 and 1915, particularly marking those deemed “feebleminded” as in need of relocation, regulation, containment, and control (<a title="Trent, James W." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/trent-james-w/">Trent 1994</a>).</p>
<p>D’Emilio’s history fleshed out what Foucault himself famously insisted: that discourses of homosexuality materialized a “new species” of person. This new “species” was increasingly regulated by the state over the course of the late nineteenth century and into the twentieth century (<a title="Canaday, Margot." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/canaday-margot/">Canaday 2009</a>). Heterosexuality, in turn, solidified as the identity of the normal and <em>healthy</em> dominant group, and “heterosexuals” began to understand themselves as such. This period of increasing state control, as the institutionalization of the “feebleminded” and others suggests, was characterized by extreme intervention and regulation around disability as well (<a title="Longmore, Paul Kand Lauri Umansky." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/longmore-paul-k-2/">Longmore and Umansky 2001</a>). The parallel control of disability suggests that disability in its modern form always has been implicitly, if not explicitly, integrated into the complex discursive emergence of “sexuality” in the West. Among the many ways the histories of sexuality and disability are intermeshed, we might highlight at least three. First, like “homosexuals” more generally, disabled people were subject to pathologization and normalization. “Abnormal” sexuality, for instance, was understood to be the cause of, or at least be related to, illness and disability, such that “abnormal” embodiment was often understood to be accompanied by “abnormal” desires and (consequently) an “abnormal” sexuality. A long-standing belief that certain disabled people have “excessive” sexual desires and thus an excessive sexuality emerges from this linkage.</p>
<p>The generally accepted (and often causally created) link between these two perceived forms of pathological excess entailed at times excessively cruel and permanently damaging forms of “rehabilitation,” such as shock therapy, sterilization, or castration. In 1927, for instance, the U.S. Supreme Court famously ruled that Carrie Buck, who had been deemed “feebleminded” and institutionalized for “incorrigible” and “promiscuous” behavior and who became pregnant after being raped, must be compulsorily sterilized. “Three generations of imbeciles is enough,” Chief Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes declared for the court’s majority opinion, reflecting the belief that both disability and perversion could be transmitted to future generations (<a title="Trent, James W." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/trent-james-w/">Trent 1994</a>). The early twentieth-century notion that disabled people’s sexuality is excessive also can be traced in numerous cultural sites—from the freak show, where visitors might be titillated by exhibits representing both bodily difference and excessive sexuality, to literary representations such as William Faulkner’s <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> (1929), in which a cognitively disabled figure, Benjy, is castrated because he is perceived to be dangerous.</p>
<p>During the twentieth century, a second intertwining of sexuality and disability has also emerged: not of pathological excess but of the seemingly paradoxical notion that disabled people are outside of the system of sexuality altogether. Disabled people often have been discursively constructed as incapable of having sexual desires or a sexual identity, due to their supposed “innocence.” The distinction between “excessive” and “innocent” often drew upon caricatures of race and class, as poor or working-class people (such as Carrie Buck) or people of color more likely were understood as excessive and dangerous than their white, middle-class, disabled counterparts. Still, the line between innocent and excessive was often very thin, and a given disabled figure (such as Faulkner’s Benjy) could quickly cross from one side to the other.</p>
<p>A third intertwining of sexuality and disability can be identified in the form of disabled people’s complex positioning in new systems of sexual and disabled identities. These newer, more generative understandings of the relationship between disability and sexuality have allowed, at times, for the development of alternate forms of sexual experience and subjectivity that were potentially outside of the increasingly rigidified heterosexual/homosexual binary. Historian <a title="Serlin, David.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/serlin-david-se-3/">David Serlin (2012)</a>, for example, recounts how some mid-twentieth-century sexologists, working with and interviewing disabled women about their bodies and pleasures, were confounded by forms of intimacy, touch, and autoeroticism that did not fit neatly into emerging understandings of sexuality or sexual identity. Exclusion from normality or a presumption that one could not be part of the heterosexual/homosexual system, in other words, sometimes allowed for disabled pleasures and disabled ways of knowing that were not reducible to dominant systems of heterosexuality that were dependent on able-bodied definitions of sexual norms.</p>
<p>These three distinct though overlapping components in a disabled history of sexuality have become legible in late twentieth-century and early twenty-first-century deployments of “sexuality,” particularly by and around activists in the disability rights movement. As disabled people began to speak or sign back to the systems that historically had contained them, they deliberately confronted ideas of excessive, innocent, or alternative sexuality. This entailed at times asserting that disabled people, too, did not have excessive or unusual but “normal” (and heterosexual) sexualities. In the United States, for instance, many activists strategically challenged federal marriage penalties that would cut off benefits such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for disabled people who married. Activists also argued for “liberation” from “repressive” ideas, thereby repudiating the widespread notion that disabled people’s sexuality was innocent or nonexistent (<a title="Shakespeare, TomKath Gillespie-Sells, and Dominic Davies." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/shakespeare-tom-kath-gillespie-sells-and-dominic-davies/">Shakespeare, Gillespie-Sells, and Davies 1996</a>). Disabled activists also worked with and through theories of disability to discover or invent new (and often queer) pleasures and sexualities. Many writers, performers, artists, and activists in disability culture as it has flourished in the early twenty-first century represent the possibilities inherent in this third intertwining area of sexuality and disability. They include Mark O’Brien, Loree Erickson, Terry Galloway, Mat Fraser, Eli Clare, Greg Walloch, and Bethany Stevens, the last of whom is a self-proclaimed “uppity crip scholar activist and sexologist.” Using this language, Stevens joins other disabled activists and artists who are self-consciously appropriating and resignifying terms from the oppressive history of sexology. Mark O’Brien’s poetry and creative nonfiction, perhaps especially his essay “On Seeing a Sex Surrogate” (<a title="OBrien, Mark." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/obrien-mark/">1990;</a> the basis for the film <em>The Sessions</em> [2012]), mark a particular turning point toward this third strategy.</p>
<p>In 1992, Anne Finger asserted, “Sexuality is often the source of our deepest oppression; it is also often the source of our deepest pain. It’s easier for us to talk about—and formulate strategies for changing—discrimination in employment, education, and housing than to talk about our exclusion from sexuality and reproduction” (<a title="Finger, Anne.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/finger-anne-se/">9</a>). Finger’s assertion—which might serve as a gloss to all three strategies for responding to the disabled history of sexuality—had become well known and had traveled through a range of locations in both disability rights and disability studies, as the twenty-first century began (<a title="Siebers, Tobin.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/siebers-tobin-se-3/">Siebers 2008b;</a> <a title="McRuer, Robertand Anna Mollow, eds." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/mcruer-robert-and-anna-mollow-eds/">McRuer and Mollow 2012</a>). Sexuality does indeed remain, two decades later, a “source of oppression” for disabled people, but it has also become a profoundly productive site for invention, experimentation, and transformation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Nor has any man who is crippled a right to be idle,” thundered social worker George Mangold at an industrial accident conference in 1922 (<a title="Mangold, George B." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/mangold-george-b/">67</a>). While he inaccurately characterized most cripples as idle, Mangold nevertheless captured the long-standing role of work and productivity in defining “disability.” In many cultures, disability has been characterized as the inability to do productive labor, a charge that has limited the citizenship and social standing of people with disabilities. Sailors on slave ships tossed disabled captives overboard; after the Civil War, impoverished Americans with visible impairments found themselves barred from begging in public and, in some cases, banned altogether from streets. But disability has also long been central to working life—a phenomenon that underscores the profound importance of incorporating class and economic perspectives more broadly into disability studies.</p>
<p>In many historical eras and regions, the threat and reality of disabling injuries have been a “normal” aspect of the everyday work experience. Until quite recently (and still today in more dangerous economic sectors), the notion that a mature worker could have an intact, unscarred body was fanciful. Indeed, the bodies of slaves, sailors, oil workers, coal miners, hotel maids, and other laborers have long borne witness to labor’s toll. Slaves’ scarred backs, sailors’ bowlegs, oil workers’ missing fingers, coal miners’ shortened breath, and maids’ back pains all testify to the near inescapability of disabling injuries. For many, such as an early Ford Motor Company worker who recalled his punch press crew losing “an average of sixteen fingers a month,” the possibility of acquiring a work-related impairment was simply “part of the job.”</p>
<p>Workplace dangers, however, have not always been distributed equally across communities. Racial and gender stereotypes have influenced employers’ visions of the ideal workforce and served to justify unsafe conditions. In the 1930s, for instance, the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation recruited migrant African American workers to drill a tunnel through deadly silica rock. Knowing nothing about the dangers and working without protection, laborers began dying within weeks from the lung disease silicosis. The company argued that “Negroes didn’t know how to care for themselves” and refused to compensate their families. Likewise, maquiladora (export-oriented) factories on the U.S.-Mexico border have preferentially hired women, believing them better suited to electronic assembly work. These relatively high-paid and “clean” indoor jobs, however, also expose women to hazardous chemical fumes.</p>
<p>Disability has often been equated with the inability to do productive work, but rarely has this assumption reflected the lived experiences of people with disabilities. The staff of the 1915 Survey of Cleveland Cripples, for example, was astonished to find many individuals who were self-supporting: “The lives of unknown cripples are much more normal than supposed” (qtd. in <a title="Nielsen, Kim." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/nielsen-kim/">Nielsen 2012, 128</a>). Indeed, a man who had lost his right arm owned a saloon, and another amputee became the city’s examiner of engineers.</p>
<p>In both the industrial and the postindustrial eras, disabled people developed strategies that have allowed them to enter—or remain—in the workforce. Deaf people discovered welcoming occupational niches: printing presses in the United States, and hair styling, sewing, and carpentry in Japan. Others turned to self-employment, such as an elderly Philadelphian who opened a newsstand in the 1920s after a laundry mangle mutilated her hand. Others have contributed to their household’s economy by performing uncompensated “care work” at home: tending to young, disabled, or elderly relatives.</p>
<p>Some employers, too, pioneered innovative approaches to include disabled workers in the labor force. Between the 1910s and 1940s, Henry Ford hired tens of thousands of elderly and disabled workers, including people with complete blindness, epilepsy, shell shock, and missing limbs, and paid them full wages. Unlike most employers, Ford viewed people with disabilities as a potential source of efficiency. He recognized their intense desire to work and analyzed his factories to determine the positions best suited to his workers’ diverse bodies. Wartime labor shortages have also led employers to willingly hire workers with disabilities; during World War II, hundreds of thousands of disabled Britons and Americans found full-time employment.</p>
<p>Working-class communities, moreover, rarely stigmatized what we might today classify as “disabilities”; rather, bodily variations have been understood as the result of poverty. American novelist Harry Crews, for instance, described his childhood fascination with the Sears catalog: “All the people in its pages were perfect. Nearly everybody I knew [in rural Georgia in the 1930s and 1940s] had something missing, a finger cut off, a toe split, an ear half-chewed away, an eye clouded with blindness from a glancing fence staple” (<a title="Crews, Harry." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/crews-harry/">1995, 58</a>). This is true in global perspective as well. In many Botswanan villages, for instance, disabilities among migrant miners, meatpackers, coal miners, and railroad workers were so common in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century that diverse bodily configurations and varying levels of productivity became “normal.”</p>
<p>As industrialization intensified, however, employers became increasingly unwilling to hire workers with disabilities—a shift that had grave economic consequences for both disabled people and their families during the twentieth century. Enamored with the efficiency movement, employers demanded workers with intact, interchangeable bodies. Making matters worse, the workmen’s compensation laws passed in many countries between the 1880s and the 1910s reinforced employers’ views of people with disabilities as potential liabilities and led them to begin screening out workers with disabilities. At times, labor unions supported these exclusionary policies. By the 1930s, such practices had spread as far afield as Botswana, where mine owners’ strict medical examinations barred men with relatively minor impairments such as clubbed feet, nearsightedness, deafness, or epilepsy. Restricted to ill-paid work such as herding others’ cattle, few could fully support a family. In Great Britain, in turn, more than half of people with disabilities lived in poverty by the 1960s, versus a quarter of the able-bodied population. As of 2013, disabled people in the United States were five times more likely than able-bodied people to be unemployed and were disproportionally likely to be employed part-time.</p>
<p>Certain types of disabled people’s labors, moreover, have frequently not been recognized or compensated as proper work. Starting in the nineteenth century, inmates of idiot schools, mental hospitals, and other asylums contributed untold numbers of hours of cleaning, farming, cooking, sewing, and caring for other inmates. Defined as rehabilitative training that would aid reintegration into the mainstream community, such labor rarely led to release. Nor were inmates paid for their work, although their labors helped to defray asylums’ expenses. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, sheltered workshops such as Goodwill Industries began to offer employment to disabled people who could not easily find regular work; such work, however, did not offer a living wage. Workshops in the United States, Canada, and Great Britain have typically taught unmarketable skills such as mat making, doll repair, or clock assembly. Furthermore, in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, Congress exempted some sheltered workshops from paying the minimum wage. As of 2011, 426,000 workers with disabilities worked for wages as low as 41 cents per hour.</p>
<p>Lack of opportunities for paid employment has also limited or circumscribed disabled people’s access to citizenship and social standing, especially in countries without a robust social welfare system. Starting in 1882, immigrants to the United States had to prove that they would not become a public charge—a category in which immigration officials automatically placed people with disabilities, even if they had job offers and a history of self-support. Rehabilitators, moreover, often characterized people with disabilities as unproductive citizens, ignoring systemic prejudice on the labor market. Goodwill Industries’ founder described his work as salvaging “human waste” thrown on an “industrial scrap heap”; training would restore “good citizenship.” Moreover, means-tested benefit programs such as Supplemental Security Income offer access to Medicaid but typically limit recipients’ incomes to the poverty level. Effectively, recipients with significant health issues cannot work more than a few hours a week without jeopardizing their health care. Famously, the late disability historian and rights activist Paul Longmore publicly burned his first book in 1988 to protest these work disincentives (<a title="Longmore, Paul K.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/disability-studies/works_cited/longmore-paul-k-se/">Longmore 2003</a>); receiving even a few hundred dollars in royalties would have cost him his ventilator and in-home assistance.</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of work to social standing, disability rights activists have long fought to gain access to the mainstream labor market. Deaf associations led a successful two-year campaign to overturn the U.S. Civil Service’s 1906 ban on deaf and mute employees, while in the 1930s, the League of the Physically Handicapped staged sit-ins in New York and Washington, DC, to gain entrance to New Deal job programs. Despite labor unions’ complex legacy regarding disability, radical unions in Argentina advocated and won minimum hiring quotas for disabled employees. And, in the 1940s and 1950s, American labor unions joined forces with—and funded—the broad-based American Federation of the Physically Handicapped, pressing the federal government to address disability as an issue of economic security.</p>
<p>Government initiatives to integrate people with disabilities into the mainstream workforce have had mixed success. Veterans, and disabled veterans in particular, have played a central role in these initiatives due to the implicit privileging of those disabled by war over those with congenital disabilities. Weimar Germany’s pioneering Law of the Severely Disabled (1920), for instance, mandated that employers hire and retain disabled veterans, ensuring that even those with severe impairments had work during the Great Depression. Voluntary initiatives, however, such as Britain’s mid-twentieth-century quota system and the U.S. “National Employ the Handicapped Week,” had little effect. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, and the ADA Amendments Act of 2009, however, have enabled disabled workers to request reasonable accommodations for their work environments and to file discrimination claims when those requests are not met. Judicial hostility and the failure to address employers’ prejudice, however, have blunted the impact of these laws. Indeed, while other provisions of the ADA have greatly increased the public presence of disabled people, unemployment rates have barely budged. Likewise, while the UN’s Year of the Disabled in 1981 and International Decade of the Disabled (1983–1993) raised awareness and led many countries to improve public accessibility, disabled people continue to face extraordinarily high rates of unemployment as of the early twenty-first century, reaching as high as 90 percent in Argentina and Bulgaria.</p>
