				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following discussion tests out the viability and even pliability of “diaspora” as both critical concept and descriptive category for a decidedly varied set of historical formations, especially as they appear at this moment in the material and intellectual unfolding of the field of U.S. Latina/o studies, a field that appears finally to be experiencing a kind of institutional consolidation and stabilization.  The fluid volatility of economic, political, and social conditions in the inter-American scene in the middle of the second decade of the twenty-first century both complicates and challenges the efforts of the field of U.S. Latina/o studies to make coherent historical and cultural sense of all of the processes of mass movement and settlement from Latin America and the Caribbean to the United States since the nineteenth century, and in whatever collections of formations the field takes to be its primary object(s) of knowledge. From its early history as a field, from the 1960s and into the early 1990s, U.S. Latina/o studies could divide its attention between work on historic communities of Latin American and Caribbean descent annexed by the United States in the course of its project of imperial expansion from the early 1800s on, and immigrant communities from a small collection of sending countries or spaces that seemed to account for the vast majority of Latina/o immigrant communities in the United States, including in order of prominence: Mexican Americans, mainland Puerto Ricans, and Cuban  Americans. In these decades, the majority of U.S. Latina/o studies work conformed fairly readily to the methodologies and practices of immigrant studies. By the 1990s, it found itself both expanding its scope  to include more newly arrived immigrant populations from the Dominican Republic, Haiti, El Salvador, and Guatemala, and complicating its analytical work on immigration by deploying newly activated critical concepts such as the borderlands, mestizaje, and (multi) cultural hybridity. And,  thanks to  the contributions of many scholars and theorists of diaspora working in the course of the early 1990s (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/hall-stuart/">Hall 1990</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/safran-william/">Safran 1991</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/boyarin-daniel-and-jonathan-boyarin/">Boyarin and Boyarin 1993</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/clifford-james/">Clifford 1994</a>), what Juan Flores (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/flores-juan-se-4/">2009</a>) has called “the explosion of diaspora- speak” began in that decade to exert its own critical conceptual influence on the work of the field.</p>
<p>“Diaspora” as a concept took hold in part because it could complicate and deepen modes of analysis that comparable categories such as immigrant, exile, refugee, expatriate, and even guest worker too often kept within narrower, more restrictive scopes. First, “diaspora” insists on a mass and collective experience of displacement, scattering, and relocation:  an  individual  could call herself an exile or immigrant or refugee or ex-pat or guest worker and no one would blink; calling oneself a “diasporic,” however, necessarily suggests identification with a group, however scattered, committed to the same work of cultural retention, reproduction, and revival of a home culture in an alien, foreign, “host” setting. Second, “diaspora” insists on the expansion of the temporal range of study to include at least two, often multiple, sometimes numerous, even countless, generations committed to that work, living potentially indefinitely beyond the singular experience of displacement  that only an  originating  or  otherwise  discrete  generation of immigrant-“diasporics” can undergo. Third, “diaspora” also insists on the role that extreme necessity or even violence can play in forcing such displacement on a mass scale (and these causes can range from forcible capture and transportation into slavery, to the threat of genocidal extermination, to extreme forms of structural economic privation, to mass expulsion following political upheaval, to flight from acute conditions of state failure that render whole sectors of a society vulnerable to extreme, even life-threatening, precarity); diasporic communities evince their lack of choice in migrating precisely by at least resisting if not entirely rejecting the often common, and for some understandable, “immigrant” impulse to assimilate fully into the host country and its culture. Finally, for the purposes of this discussion, “diaspora” also insists on naming a set of living human practices that inhabit a specifically <em>cultural </em>field; while “immigrant/exile/refugee/ex-pat/guest worker” all primarily denote forms of official legal, political, or economic status, “diasporic” retains an entirely informal, unofficial, ambiguous, even improvisatory, undocumentable (and for this reason often expressive, imaginative, creative, <em>critical</em>) sense. To put it bluntly, no one can ever ask for, and no one could ever produce, official “papers” or documentation proving “diasporic” status (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/edwards-brent-hayes/">Edwards 2001</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/gopinath-gayatri/">Gopinath 2005</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/flores-juan-se-4/">Flores 2009</a>).</p>
<p>Of the major national groups arguably contributing in the greatest numbers to the unfolding of the diverse processes of diasporic life in the multicultural United States, those hailing from Latin America and the Caribbean pose a distinctly heterogeneous and uneven set of examples, resulting mostly from the distinct effects of the United States’ complex history of colonial and imperial ambition in the region, and the varying effects of two centuries of shifting terms in trade policy, labor policy, immigration policy, and foreign  policy  across the states in question. Because the large plurality of Latina/o Americans are people of Mexican descent, and because the formation of a hybrid and widespread Mexican American world predates even the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which settled the terms of the U.S.- Mexican War, any description of a Mexican “diaspora” in the United States would have to concede an intense internal complexity and heterogeneity, one that would have to reconcile the centuries-long, fully hybridized mode of “Mexican American” life on the actual territorial border with the more explicitly conscious, intentional, and activist modes of, say, “Chicana/o” cultural and political practice since the 1960s, and with the proliferation since the 1980s of multiple new outposts of Mexican immigrant settlement in the United States in locations as widespread as the Great Northwest, Midwestern cities like Chicago and Detroit, and the American South.</p>
<p>Dynamics of Puerto Rican migration from the island to the mainland, especially since the 1898 annexation of the island after the Spanish-American War, might as readily avail itself of an insistent set of internal complexities. In the Puerto Rican case, that different set of complexities comes in part from the island’s neocolonial status in relation to the U.S. state (rendering all Puerto Ricans U.S. citizens, for starters), the more focused bilateral formation of immigrant movement  between the island and locations of settlement closely collected around New York City and its surrounding tristate area, the perhaps more constant movement of whole populations back and forth between island and mainland, and the distinctly different racial challenges that especially Puerto Ricans of African descent encountered across a twentieth-century United States transitioning from Jim Crow to the civil rights movement to a more complex mode of “multicultural” racial consciousness that finally understood that Latina/o and black were not actually mutually exclusive states of existence.</p>
<p>Cuban Americans in turn also arrived into their own modes of diasporic life and practice in a manner that reflects their country of  origin’s irreducibly distinct geopolitical relationship with the United States. While Cubans had also been leaving the island and moving to mainland North America since the early 1800s for both political and economic reasons, the mass exodus of almost a million people who fled the island after the 1959 Castro Revolution came to determine the defining characteristics of whatever formation could call itself “Cuban America”: more politically conservative than the other major  Latina/o  groups, more readily ascending to “model minority” status thanks to favorable immigration policies in the United States and the cultural if not political capital it brought with it as a primarily displaced elite class, likelier in its earlier waves of migration to be whiter, and likelier too to reflect the attitudes and values of the dominant, vocal political class that settled in Miami and in a few short decades converted that city into as important and influential a Latina/o American metropolis as New York or Los Angeles or San Antonio. Similar kinds of historical accounts of this complexity and heterogeneity could also be offered for the other national groupings settling into their American diasporic life in as large numbers, if more recently, especially from the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Guatemala, and El Salvador (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/flores-juan-se-4/">Flores 2009</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/ortiz-ricardo-l-se/">Ortíz 2009a</a>, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/ortiz-ricardo-l-se-2/">2009b</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rodriguez-ana-patricia/">A. P. Rodríguez 2009</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/zavella-patricia-se/">Zavella 2011</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/lopez-antonio/">López 2012</a>).</p>
<p>For the remainder of this discussion, however, we will need to take a step back and consider some larger, more amorphous but perhaps more viable diasporic formations that demand as much if not even more attention from the field of Latina/o studies, especially going forward, than those organized around the more conventional and always problematic logics of the nation-state. One of these formations is regional, or perhaps in other ways alternatively geographical: this means, for example, studying diasporic formations coming not from Cuba, Puerto Rico, or the Dominican Republic specifically, but from the Caribbean more generally, or even specifically from the “Spanish” Caribbean, or from the island of Hispaniola; it also means studying a more general Central American transnational diasporic formation, one including all the significant sending nations in the region (Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Panama) and tracking thereby a decidedly transnational political exodus driven by the threats to life and livelihood of an intensely violent several decades of civil war, gang war, drug war, and genocide. Such “regional” analysis would in turn take shape in North American sites of diasporic settlement mostly by looking specifically at forms of trans-diasporic interaction and exchange: for example, when increasing numbers of Central Americans modify to the point of transforming the Mexican-dominant Latina/o character of Los Angeles, or the Caribbean-dominant Latina/o character of New York City, or when the intensifying Latina/o diversity occasioned by increasing numbers of Colombians, Venezuelans, and Haitians overwhelm and recast the once Cuban-dominant Latina/o character of Miami.</p>
<p>Certainly other alternative logics of diasporic formation can be as fruitfully studied; these include racial logics that would, for example, focus on the African (or American, Indigenous, or mestiz@) diasporic dimensions of the U.S. Latina/o diaspora; they could also include economic logics that distinguish between the practices of displaced elites fleeing dictatorships in countries like Cuba, Haiti, or the Dominican Republic from the practices of more conventional, working-, under-, and subaltern-class “economic” migrants primarily responding to the push-and-pull forces of a fully globalized transnational labor market. In addition, these also might include the “logics” of family, gender, sexuality, and physical ability, wherein conditions forcing mass displacement and enabling stable-enough resettlement and cultural reproduction elsewhere might differently impact men and women (especially but not exclusively depending on their parental status and the citizenship status of their children), sexual minorities forced to confront queer- and trans-phobic violence in both home- and host-lands, and the growing number of “medical” migrants seeking access to health benefits and services.</p>
<p>In the mid-2010s, the most telling indicators of how future mass movements of peoples from a variety of Latin American and Caribbean locations might grow from or redirect the course of such movements from the past include: the viral and incipient growth of extreme criminal violence related to the drug trade and the cartels and street gangs that manage that trade in countries like Mexico, which struggle with effects of government corruption so pervasive that politically they operate emphatically as narco-states, and where, in countries like El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, already vulnerable and unstable national states are literally ceding aspects of direct political and social control to gangs; the Puerto Rican government’s failure to meet its mounting debts, threatening to plunge the island’s economy into a deep and perhaps irreversible depression; the intensifying racist, anti-immigrant legal initiatives on the Dominican side of Hispaniola to displace and depatriate hundreds of thousands of people of Haitian descent born in the Dominican Republic as far back as the early twentieth century but never acquiring official documentation of Dominican citizenship; the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba after nearly fifty-five years of animosity, stalemate, and blockade; and, finally, the epochal state failure of the United States’ federal legislature itself to pass the kind of comprehensive immigration reform that would meaningfully transform the character and the promise of the U.S. Latina/o diaspora writ large by incorporating into the nation’s political, economic, social, and cultural life the many millions of undocumented Americans hoping to remain, and to rise as, Americans.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because of its generally positive impact on the life chances of individuals, and because it engenders greater social equality, education in the United States is more frequently characterized by what it accomplishes (outcomes) than by the knowledge that is actually taught in schools (content) or by the way it is delivered (process). Hence, education as a means to socially desired ends is a focus herein, although the content and process—frequently cast as policy alternatives  in the education of Latinas/os—are also addressed. The growing demand for ethnic studies by the Latina/o community across the country is a testament to the currency that debates over content and process have. A shift from outcome to content and process draws on a civil rights frame that positions the Latina/o not as an object of study, but rather as a subject of personal and social transformation. Accordingly, this shift permits greater understanding of relation of self to society, root causes of oppression, positive cultural identity, and a sense of place in history in a democracy where a powerful sense of rights and responsibilities gets nurtured.</p>
<p>Despite the relation of education to mobility, education is, at best, a vexed proposition for most U.S. Latinas/ os. Low levels of educational attainment and academic failure persist as a defining feature of their U.S. educational experience. Explanations for this tend to look either to cultural or to structural factors. With respect to the former, individual background characteristics, as well as institutional and historical circumstances are examined. With respect to the latter, although arguments about cultural and genetic inferiority have been largely discredited, the dominant culture of measurement embodied in our systems of high-stakes testing and educational accountability is influential in reinscribing a worldview of deficit thinking because of its embedded assumption of Anglo cultural superiority (Padilla 2005). Since the power to measure is an extension of the power to rank and assign value to humans on continua related to educational competencies, where Latinas/os systematically come up short, the silence on this by mainstream models of achievement allows myths like individualism, meritocracy, and Anglo cultural superiority to flourish (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/steinberg-stephen/">Steinberg 1996</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/ochoa-gilda-l/">Ochoa 2007</a></strong>).</p>
<p>Mainstream models of achievement ignore unearned privilege as a factor in mobility and begin instead with the premise that education in U.S. society is based primarily on individual merit and effort. In this view, personal income, occupational status, and educational attainment levels result from one’s personal investment  in these. In his classic comparative analysis of the U.S. and British secondary educational systems, Ralph H. Turner characterizes the U.S. educational system as one of “contest mobility,” as opposed to “sponsored mobility” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/turner-ralph-h/">1960, 855</a></strong>). Otherwise termed a “meritocracy,” elite status goes to those that earn it through their efforts. The popular meritocratic myth—better known as the “American Dream”—aligns to a larger conceptual framework that sociologists term the “immigrant analogy,” whereby the incorporation experiences of all other racial and ethnic groups in U.S. society are likened to that of their European-origin counterparts (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/steinberg-stephen/">Steinberg 1996</a></strong>).</p>
<p>Turner’s (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/turner-ralph-h/">1960</a></strong>) sponsored mobility thesis outlines how entrance into elite society is contingent on one’s sponsorship by elite members already located within the circle in order to gain access. Anticipating what later became scholarship in the area of cultural capital and social reproduction frameworks (see, for example,<strong> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/bourdieu-pierre-and-jean-claude-passeron/">Bourdieu and Passeron 1977</a></strong>), this thesis posits that those who are already members of the elite judge potential entrants on the extent to which they possess characteristics that they wish to see in their future peers.</p>
<p>Persistent correlations of race/ethnicity, class, and gender with academic achievement and educational attainment, however, not only cast doubt on the view that the United States is a meritocracy, but also point to historical and institutional factors that both illuminate the role of sponsorship mobility in the United  States and explain Latinas/os’ overwhelming social location as members of our society’s lowest classes. Historically, the concept of “mode of incorporation” has explanatory power. It differentiates the European-origin experience of coming to this country and continent in a voluntary manner, as opposed to other groups like Latinas/os that become part of this country involuntarily as a result of conquest, slavery, or colonization (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/blauner-robert/">Blauner 1972</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/ogbu-john-u/">Ogbu 1978</a></strong>;<strong> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/leiberson-stanley/">Leiberson 1980</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/ignatiev-noel/">Ignatiev 1995</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/steinberg-stephen-se/">Steinberg 2001</a></strong>). These historical facts of minorities’ forceful incorporation experiences into the U.S. political economy is not mitigated by the presence of recent Latina/o immigrants on a putatively voluntary basis since they inherit the legacy of social, cultural, political, and economic oppression and disenfranchisement experienced by their racial and ethnic forerunners.</p>
<p>Turning now to institutional factors with this historical backdrop in mind, a defining feature of U.S. education is “majority-minority relations.” The word “minority” is not a numerical term. Rather, it references both power and its relational aspect. One cannot have  a minority without a majority or vice versa. Hence, societies can have a demographic majority like Latinas/os that is simultaneously a social, cultural, political, and economic minority.</p>
<p>Robert Blauner (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/blauner-robert/">1972</a></strong>) and Joel Spring (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/spring-joel/">1997</a></strong>) maintain that because of their modes of incorporation, Latinas/os and other minority groups are forced to shed their languages, cultures, and community-based identities and adopt cultural ways of speaking, behaving, and interacting that mirror the mores, values, and interaction styles of the dominant, Anglo majority group. I refer to this as “subtractive schooling” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/valenzuela-angela/">Valenzuela 1999</a></strong>). Moreover, drawing from educational philosopher Nel Noddings’s (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/noddings-nel/"><strong>1992</strong></a>) work on caring and education, I acknowledge the presence of aesthetic or superficial ways of caring that most Anglo teachers possess as a result of their culture and preparation and that have the effect  of objectifying Latina/o youth. Reduced to objects— especially test scores—they get treated in a bureaucratic manner whereby teachers teach subjects, not students (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/mcneil-linda-and-angela-valenzuela/">McNeil and Valenzuela 2001</a></strong>).</p>
<p>Noddings (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/noddings-nel/">1992</a></strong>), in contrast, advocates for authentic caring toward youth by school functionaries in a manner that respects the totality of who they are and what they bring to educational contexts. I acknowledge both the transformative potential and politics of authentic caring and further posit that the youth I studied in a three-year ethnography of an urban, inner-city high school reject not education, but <em>schooling </em>(<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/valenzuela-angela/">Valenzuela 1999</a></strong>). That is, they reject being objectified and having precious little if anything about their histories, stories, languages, communities, or cultures deemed worthy of inclusion into the school curriculum or learning experience. Worse yet, youth’s resistance to this objectification places them at risk within educational settings (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/valenzuela-angela/">Valenzuela 1999</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/ochoa-gilda-l/">Ochoa 2007</a></strong>).</p>
<p><em>Ser bien educada/o</em>, or being well educated in the Latina/o sense, emanates from a set of cultural values based on respect, reciprocity, and relation. Despite Noddings’s (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/noddings-nel/">1992</a></strong>) assertion that all educational experience should be premised on relation, Latinas/os’ lack of dominant group. In his participatory action research study among high school youth in San Bernardino, California, Louie Rodriguez (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rodriguez-louie-f/">2012</a></strong>) extends this analysis of caring to the “politics of recognition,” wherein youth seek acknowledgment in different ways. For some, this consisted of simple, relational recognition, whereas others desire that the curriculum and learning experience, as well as deeper levels of recognition, be related to the historical, social, psychological, cultural, and political realities of their communities.</p>
<p>Blauner (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/blauner-robert/">1972</a></strong>) indicates that while many ethnic groups that migrate to the United States similarly face discrimination and begin life at the proverbial “bottom,” the insistence of the dominant group that the subordinate group subscribe to its language, culture, values, and norms is particularly humiliating to U.S. minorities. Latinas/os’ minority status is evident in numerous ways, including the underrepresentation of Latina/o teachers in public schools (7.1 percent, nationally according to <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/villegas-ana-maria/">Villegas [2007]</a></strong>); the lack of books and curricula that speak to Latinas/os’ history, culture, and experience; hyper-segregation in underfunded schools—particularly among English learners within large, inner-city districts; an uneven commitment to bilingual education; curricular tracking coupled with Latinas/os’ concentrations in the lower, non-college- bound tracks; excessive standardized testing; high retention rates; over- as well as under-identification of special education needs; low teacher expectations; and lack of access to quality teaching, advanced placement courses, tutorial support, after-school programs, and public schools themselves, particularly in the wake of school closures that are taking place throughout the country (for instance, see <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/de-la-torre-marisa-and-julia-gwynne/">de la Torre and Gwynne’s [2009]</a></strong> analysis of Chicago public schools).</p>
<p>Defying the notion of a meritocracy, institutionalized discrimination overwhelmingly defines the educational experiences of Latinas/os in the United States such that even if Latinas/os make progress, the gap relative to Anglos remains constant (Gándara and Contreras 2009; Madrid 2011). Moreover, this culturally chauvinist posture of U.S. schooling is layered over a long history of de-indigenization not only in the United States but also in public schools in Mexico and Latin America from which many of our immigrant youth emanate. Consequently, Latina/o students have endured a long history of educational neglect and lack of recognition that further attaches to a widely shared experience of alienation from schools (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/carter-thomas-p/">Carter 1970</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/valenzuela-angela/">Valenzuela 1999</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/ochoa-gilda-l/">Ochoa 2007</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rodriguez-louie-f/">L. Rodriguez 2012</a></strong>).</p>
<p>Latina/o studies’ education scholars have endeavored to identify means for overcoming the social stigma of being Mexican or Latina/o in the United States, generally. The most promising directions are in the areas of bilingual education (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/bartlett-lesley-and-ofelia-garcia/">Bartlett and Garcia 2011</a></strong>); culturally relevant teachers and teaching (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/villegas-ana-maria-and-jacqueline-jordan-irvine/">Villegas and Irvine 2010</a></strong>); improving teacher recruitment and teacher preparation (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/ochoa-gilda-l/">Ochoa 2007</a></strong>); sociocultural and sociopolitical curricula and instruction (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/bartolome-lilia-i/">Bartolomé and Balderrama 2001</a></strong>;<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/nieto-sonia-melissa-rivera-sandra-quinones-and-jason-irizarry/"> Nieto et al. 2012</a></strong>); respecting and affirming cultural difference and incorporating the cultural wealth that exists in Latina/o communities (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/yosso-tara-j-se/">Yosso 2005</a></strong>;<strong> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/palmer-deborah-k/">Palmer 2008</a></strong>); making use of students’ funds of knowledge (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/gonzalez-norma-luis-c/">González, Moll, and Amanti 2005</a></strong>); countering stereotypes and deficit thinking (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/valencia-richard-r/">Valencia 2010</a></strong>); increasing parent involvement by reframing it as bicultural parent engagement (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/olivos-edward-m/">Olivos, Jiménez-Castellanos, and Ochoa 2011</a></strong>); developing parents’ interpersonal networks of support that include teachers (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/stanton-salazar-ricardo-d/">Stanton-Salazar 1997</a></strong>); and advocating for research-based policies that address the structural and organizational features of school, including  tracking  (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/flores-gonzalez-nilda/">Flores-González  2002</a></strong>),  retention (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/valencia-richard-r-2/">Valencia and Villarreal 2005</a></strong>), high-stakes standardized testing (Valenzuela 2005), and disciplinary policies and school culture (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rodriguez-louie-f/">L. Rodriguez 2012</a></strong>).</p>
<p>Drawing from scholars like the late Paulo Freire (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/freire-paulo/">1970</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/freire-paulo-se/">1998</a></strong>) and Daniel Solórzano and Dolores Delgado Bernal (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/solorzano-daniel-and-dolores-delgado-bernal/">2001</a></strong>), among the most significant, current theoretical preoccupations in Latina/o education scholarship pertain to the relationship of identity and acculturation to the development of positive orientations toward schools and students’ transformational consciousness. To this end, the mediating role of a culturally relevant Latina/o studies curriculum and a critical bicultural pedagogy in the classroom holds promise. Responding, in effect, to the above-mentioned concerns related to the politics of recognition and caring (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/valenzuela-angela/">Valenzuela 1999</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rodriguez-louie-f/">L. Rodriguez 2012</a></strong>), these approaches would mean not only that students are taught in their native tongues, but that critical bicultural educators interrogate, along with their students, the ideologies, policies, practices, and structures of domination that shape their lives and their communities. Such a curriculum encourages them to consider the ways that they seek emancipation for themselves, as well as for their communities, while simultaneously considering the ways that they themselves are colonized and contradictory (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/darder-antonia/">Darder 1991</a></strong>).</p>
<p>Scholarship on community-university-school partnerships (e.g., <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/valenzuela-angela-and-patricia-d/">Valenzuela and López 2014</a></strong>), together with participatory action research, makes this pedagogy actionable by equipping youth with the intellectual, scholarly, policy, and political tools they need in order to become agents of change in their own respective contexts. In the process, they secure preparedness for college (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/cammarota-julio-and-michelle-fine-eds/">Cammarota and Fine 2008</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rodriguez-louie-f/">L. Rodriguez 2012</a></strong>). Hence, college preparedness is a byproduct of  an otherwise meaningful engagement with education, which considers student’s desires, need for recognition, and quest for fairness and equity.</p>
<p>Chicana feminism and critical race theory—through their shared intellectual preoccupation with power relations, identity, and consciousness—acknowledge the broader power relationships in institutions and society and how their priorities, policies, and practices shape Latinas/os’ educational experiences. Chicana and Latina scholars’ separate and combined intellectual preoccupation with epistemology, spirituality, and indigeneity (e.g.,<strong> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/facio-elisa-and-irene-lara-eds/">Facio and Lara 2014</a></strong>) illuminates other ways of knowing and being in the world that further align to notions of well-being and being well educated from a Latina/o perspective (<em>ser bien educada/o</em>). This is not a call to a new orthodoxy, but rather a call for epistemological freedom in a form of education that is inclusive, enriching, culturally resonant, and humane as part and parcel of a progressive social-justice agenda.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is a commonplace in American studies to consider the nation’s founders as progenitors of the conception of the United States as an “exceptional” empire such that Thomas Paine’s oft-cited aphorism “We have it in our power to begin the world all over again” begets Thomas Jefferson’s call for an “Empire of Liberty,” which, in turn, would spread freedom across the globe in the name of the equally pithy and consecrated Declaration of Independence’s “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” What then is particular and theoretically constitutive of the keyword “empire” for the field of Latina/o studies? “Empire” is the keyword that frames both the field of Latina/o studies and what Latina/o studies projects interrogate in order to make visible how empire’s scattered remains throughout the Americas cross national borders as well as affective states of being. In so doing, Latina/o studies’ methodological recourse to and critique of empire seeks to apprehend empire’s legacies beyond the singular historical actor model of the exceptional nation-state in order to engage how empire saturates and conditions affects across space, time, and bodies. This is particularly significant when we consider that Latinas/os are the nation’s largest “minority” at over 55 million strong yet the most underrepresented in national institutions, circuits of power, and political blocks. Yet despite this daunting demographic reality, the absence of Latinas/ os from circuits of power largely render this expansive demographic of multitudes of variegated <em>latinidades </em>invisible. As Kirsten Silva Gruesz (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/gruesz-kirsten-silva-se/">2003, 56</a>) succinctly diagnosed the vagaries of the Latina/o question, “as Marx said of capital, Latinos seem to be everywhere and nowhere at once.” What are the mechanisms that both delimit Latina/o political emergence and sustain Latina/o invisibility despite the demographic evidence to the contrary?</p>
<p>Latina/o studies’ critique of empire insists on making this multitude historically manifest as well as laying bare the imperial logics that occlude historical cause and effect relations: there is no Latina/o migration or immigration to the United States that was not first occasioned by either U.S. intervention throughout the Americas or as a result of U.S. corporate interventions into nationally or culturally sovereign states (as is the case with Puerto Rico). If Latinas/os are cast as interlopers feeding on the national body politic’s ever-shrinking largesse, then Latina/o studies’ relation to empire provides the scaffolding to examine and explicate empire’s historical erasures. As Fredric Jameson puts it, “history is what hurts” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/jameson-fredric/">1981, 102</a>), but it hurts Latinas/os disproportionately, and beyond corporal abjection and death. That “hurt”—what Gloria Anzaldúa (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/anzaldua-gloria-e/">1987</a>) once called the “1,950 mile-long open wound”— bleeds into the realm of epistemological impossibility: Latina/o knowledge projects that attempt to document the Latina/o experience are as susceptible to the same crisis of legitimation in the academy as Latina/o bodies are in the political sphere. Countering such imperial violence requires theoretical and methodological acuity, which can archive and render visible how and why Latinas/os did not come as immigrants or migrants to the United States, but rather “the United States came to them in the form of colonial enterprises” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/stavans-ilan-se/">Stavans 2011, iiii</a>). More than a decolonial gesture, such a reframing of imperial logics is an epistemological investment that seeks to reap the dividends of Latina/o futures through the agencies of a nimble Latina/o studies project that unsettles empire’s founding conceits premised on freedom. Such a project insists on untangling Jefferson’s “Empire of Liberty” from the imperial mechanisms that delimit freedoms and cast liberty’s others as literally and figuratively invisible. The promise of economic freedom, freedom from unjust harm, and the freedom to achieve affective states of fulfillment are counterfactuals in the face of the brutal and illegitimate appropriation of space, time, and bodies that inveigh against democratic egalitarianism’s promise. It is in this sense that Latina/o studies’ engagement with empire seeks an accounting that would make visible how and why “the gift of freedom” is empire’s principle calumny—the impossible promise that, beyond redress, requires the necessary correctives to set past “odious debts” afire through historical visibility and the theoretical armor to guard against those future “deaths to come” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/nguyen-mimi-thi/">Nguyen 2012, xii</a>).</p>
<p>The liberal left conception of empire was radically altered in the field of American studies after the publication of Amy Kaplan and Donald E. Pease’s <em>Cultures of United States Imperialism </em>(<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/kaplan-amy-and-donald-e/">1993</a>). Kaplan and Pease’s major contribution resided in their collection’s methodological and theoretical rejection of the intellectual strictures of the disciplinarily bound field of “diplomatic history” and its well-known founding insistence in understanding the “age of empire” as neatly and temporally bookmarked between 1898 and 1917 and, to stress the obvious, ensconced in the past. Kaplan and Pease’s volume conceived of empire largely as a process of critique requiring the interrogation of how U.S. capital incursions, or “Pecunia Americana,” motivated imperial interventions in the Américas and the world with the concomitant but ever elusive promise of freedom held in abeyance from freedom’s always future colonial subjects. However, perhaps it was Antonio Benítez Rojo (1931–2005) in his influential <em>La isla que se repite: El Caribe y la perspectiva posmoderna </em>(<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/benitez-rojo-antonio/">1989</a>), translated in 1996 as <em>The Repeating Island</em>, who most cogently anticipated what we might consider a critique of empire from the vantage point of the global South. Following Colombian historian Germán Arciniegas (1900–1999) and his monumental study, <em>La biografía del Caribe </em>(<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/arciniegas-german/">[1945] 1966</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/arciniegas-german-se/">translated as <em>Caribbean, </em><em>Sea of the New Word </em>[1946]</a>), Benítez Rojo succinctly summarized the inter-American origins of empires’ logics beyond the historical strictures of the modern nation-state when he centered the critique of empire on “Pecunia Americana”—that is, on a critique of capital and how liberty’s others have become exchangeable commodities under capital. Benítez Rojo makes the connection between world-systems theory and capital critiques from the epistemic anchor of the global South when he writes, “The Atlantic is today the Atlantic (NATO, World Bank, New York Stock Exchange, European Economic Community, etc.) because it was the painfully conceived child of the Caribbean.  .  .  . It is possible to defend successfully the hypothesis that without deliveries from the Caribbean womb Western capital accumulation would not have been sufficient to effect a move . . . from the so-called Mercantilist Revolution to the Industrial Revolution” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/benitez-rojo-antonio-se/">1996, 5</a>). The “American” legacies of this Atlantic and inter-American history of empire’s circum-Caribbean emergence condition the field of Latina/o studies’ relation to and critiques of empire from the vantage point of a “Latina/o studies of the global South” model of capital economic and historical critique. It is in this sense that Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri could be said to elaborate—however unwittingly—Benítez Rojo’s critique of capital in their book <em>Empire </em>(<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/hardt-michael-and-antonio-negri/">2000</a>) vis-à-vis what I am calling “Pecunia Americana” in my critical short-hand.</p>
<p>Hardt and Negri argue in <em>Empire </em>that we live in a U.S.-dominated imperial world order wherein the nation-state has so lost its geographically determined specificity that temporal and spatial limits of domination are enacted across space and time through the agencies of capital. Where Negri and Hardt recenter the United States as the locus of critical sense-making for a critique of the “empire of liberty,” Benítez Rojo’s intervention has the advantage of naming, not the most recent iteration of empire’s manifestation, but the origin of a structured world-system that has historically achieved military, economic, and psychic domination through racialization and by attempting to convince the colonized that they have been colonized for their own good. Both reconstituting and extending the disciplinary blinders of diplomatic history’s bookmarks for empire (1898 and 1917), the emerging field paradigm of Latina/o studies of the global South insists on an accounting capable of moving beyond the historical and interpretive blinders of Jefferson’s “Empire of Liberty.”</p>
<p>It is to this end that scholars in ethnic studies, American studies, and Latina/o studies have extended Michael Paul Rogin’s (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rogin-michael-paul/">1983</a>) coinage of the term “the American 1848” in order to map the emergence of post-industrial racialization as the precondition for denying freedom to liberty’s others: Amerindians, blacks, Asians and Southeast Asian Americans, and Latinas/os as the racialized confluence of these “legally” and socially disenfranchised others. For Rogin, the Mexican American War (1846–1848), along with “the eruption and apparent pacification of the slavery crisis, between 1846 and 1851, defines the American 1848” and anticipates the Civil War (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rogin-michael-paul/">1983, 103</a>). In pursuing his analysis, Rogin elaborates what Marx termed the “beautiful revolution,” the French Revolution of 1848, in order to distinguish it from its Mexico-U.S. analogue in 1848. While the French Revolution had social inequality as its principal object for correction, the latter was ultimately about establishing racial inequality as the structural precondition for the post-industrial incarnation of the empire of liberty as Arciniegas and Benítez-Rojo would have understood it. As I have summarized elsewhere, it is under these conditions that the epistemologically violent appropriation of territories and bodies emerge so that, for example, the national signifier “Mexican” can be appropriated as a term of racial identification and as a synonym for racialized blackness after the American 1848 (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/lima-lazaro/">Lima 2007</a>).</p>
<p>Methodologically speaking, Latina/o studies of the global South’s critique of empire necessarily reframes familiar <em>grand récits </em>in order to defamiliarize their naturalization as givens guarded against epistemological reflection and critique. While the familiar narrative arc of the Monroe Doctrine (1823), for example, had it that any efforts by European nations to interfere in the Americas would be met by U.S. military aggression, it ignores generative Latina/o studies work that goes against the grain of such historical amnesias. Raúl Coronado’s <em>A World Not to Come: A History of Latino Writing and Print Culture </em>(<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/coronado-raul/">2013</a>) reminds us that the Monroe Doctrine was ultimately the co-creation of U.S. diplomats as well as of radical republican Latin American agents who wished to oust Spain from both Cuba and Puerto Rico after the French Restoration’s invasion of liberal Spain in 1823. As Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra has reminded us, “For every fictional Berrian ready to liberate Mexico and create empire, there was a nonfictional Latino Lafayette helping Philadelphia and Washington find their republican selves” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/canizares-esguerra-jorge-se/">2016, 200</a>).</p>
<p>Such key reframings of historical master narratives—from the American 1848’s prehistory vis- à-vis the Monroe Doctrine, to the U.S.-Mexico War of 1848—characterize Latina/o studies’ investments in critiques of empire above and against American studies’ field critique of empire. Beyond diplomatic history’s bookends of 1898 and 1917, the Spanish American War (1898) is understood not as a U.S imperial exception that ends in 1917, but rather as a continuation of Arciniegas’ and Benítez-Rojo’s structural reframing, which privileges not state actors but Pecunia Americana’s evacuation of cause-effect relations and its corresponding historical amnesias. It is in this sense that the Foraker Act of 1900, which made Puerto Rico a protectorate of the United States, begets the truncated citizenship imposed on Puerto Ricans in 1917 through the Jones Act after the U.S. colonization of the island in 1898.</p>
<p>Read from this generative framing proposed by a Latina/o studies of the global South and its critique of empire, the gift of freedom can no longer be understood through Jefferson’s “Empire of Liberty” as a deferred promise for Pecunia Americana’s others but rather as empire’s principal epistemological trap from which critiques of empire can emerge to fortify democratic practice rather than delimiting it through historical amnesias. Such an investment in methodological anchors from the vantage point of the global South have the potential to revise what stories count beyond their conditions of reception and the vicissitudes of historical archiving in order to safeguard deaths to come as well the odious debts that must be rescinded on ethical grounds. The prehistories of empire’s occluded remains, its temporal present, as well as its related futures, are Latina/o studies’ signal contribution to the reframing of single-actor model understandings of empire. In the process, Latina/o studies of the global South’s reframing of empire foregrounds a capacious method that can account for the historical, affective, and corporeal hauntings of empire’s remains.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If one were to identify the single attribute most politicians incessantly assign Latinas/os—and assume and emphasize as a  point of  solidarity for  the sake  of vote procurement for their campaigns—it would indisputably be the salutary possession of “family values.” Although what counts as “values” in the electoral context tends to rely on ethnic and religious typecasting and ideological  supposition,  the family is nonetheless crucial for Latinas/os as it has long functioned as a “crucial symbol and organizing principle” for collective mobilization and quotidian affairs (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rodriguez-richard-t/">R. T. Rodríguez 2009</a></strong>). Indeed, as politicians and others are astutely aware, the family is almost impossible to disentangle from how we understand Latina/o cultures, histories, and politics.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the intermittent praiseworthy family qualities granted to them, the “problems” ailing Latina/o communities are routinely held responsible for maladjusted relations. Contrasting with a family values ideal that conforms to a nuclear kinship network— one that historian Stephanie Coontz (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/coontz-stephanie/">1993</a></strong>) argues is animated by an unfeasible nostalgic longing—Latina/o family dynamics have long been subjected to derision and pathology. Foundational scholars in the social sciences (particularly in the fields of anthropology and sociology) who investigated Mexican and Puerto Rican families, for example, were instrumental in attributing factors such as poverty and machismo to reputed cultural beliefs and habits fueling familial  dysfunction. Writing about the work of William Madsen and  Arthur J. Rubel, sociologist Norma Williams maintains that such early scholarship on Chicano families “adopted the stereotypical definitions of the  majority  society in describing Mexican Americans” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/williams-norma/">1990, 2</a></strong>). Because many Latina/o family practices did not correspond with those of the dominant culture, the value of moving beyond nuclear models of household formation would be lost on those invested in upholding normative perceptions of family arrangement. Indeed, fictive kinship practices like <em>compadrazgo </em>and <em>comadrazgo </em>exceeded the ties between immediate blood relations by counting extended relations and unrelated community members as family.</p>
<p>Responding to social science distortions and emphasizing the distinct modes of fashioning family in light of the various forms of discrimination experienced by Latinas/os in the United States, scholars like Octavio Ignacio Romano-V., Virginia E. Sánchez Korrol, Miguel Montiel, Patricia Zavella, and José Hernández aimed to set the record straight by showing the plethora of familial experiences that do not subscribe to hard and fast notions of gender relations and inflexible ideas of tradition. Recently, anthropologist Brian Montes (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/montes-brian/">2005</a></strong>) has shown how the work of anthropologist Oscar Lewis— whose books <em>Five Families: Mexican Case Studies in the Culture of Poverty </em>(<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/lewis-oscar/"><strong>1959</strong></a>) and <em>La Vida: A Puerto Rican Family in the Culture of Poverty—San Juan and New York </em>(<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/lewis-oscar-se-3/">1966b</a></strong>) are representative—holds persistent sway in some quarters of the academy as his “culture of poverty” thesis continues to be lauded despite the critiques of it made by Latina/o scholars.</p>
<p>With many scholars studying Latina/o communities intimately connected to emergent social movements, the reclamation of the family took on symbolic significance for galvanization purposes. Various segments of the Chicano civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s—from student activists to the United Farm Workers, for example—deployed the family (or <em>la familia</em>) as an organizing principle to bond unrelated yet similarly disenfranchised individuals as a community.  Writer and activist José Armas self-published a  manifesto  in 1972 whose title alone, <em>La Familia de La Raza</em>, signaled the importance of casting “the people” as an extended family. The impulse behind Armas’s call to mobilization was also at the heart of “El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán.” Also known as the Chicano Movement Manifesto, “El Plan” was drafted at the historic Chicano Youth Liberation Conference in 1969 and identified Chicano culture as that which “unites and educates the family of La Raza towards liberation with one heart and one mind” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/chicano-youth-liberation-conference/">Chicano Youth Liberation Conference 1972, 405</a></strong>). Exemplifying what sociologist Maxine Baca Zinn designated “political familism” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/baca-zinn-maxine/">1975</a></strong>), la familia de la raza functioned as the fundamental cultural nationalist beckoning for collective empowerment and action.</p>
<p>Yet well before Chicanos/as would reclaim the family for nationalist self-determination, the linkage between family and nation that materialized in Puerto Rico during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was emblematized as “la gran familia jíbara” (or the great <em>jíbaro </em>family). Like the mestizo who stood at the center of Chicano cultural nationalist ideology, the mytho-historical figure of the <em>jíbaro</em>, or the peasant, served as a decisive symbol for Puerto Rican nationalist ideology given its adaptability within a range of historical, social, and political contexts. Identifying  a recharged significance of la gran familia jíbara as an organizing strategy in the early twentieth  century by the creole elite to oppose the colonial authority of the United States, Arlene Torres (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/torres-arlene/">1998</a></strong>) notes how blacks and mulatos surprisingly found themselves integrated into the Puerto Rican national family despite past and enduring marginalization based on racial difference.</p>
<p>Whereas Latinas/os might be said, in the words of Chicana lesbian writer Cherríe Moraga, to “fight back with the family” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/moraga-cherrie-se-3/">1993b</a></strong>), the nationalist impetus to conflate the nation or the community with the family tends to overlook the hierarchies that exist among those comprising a presumably cohesive constituency. To be sure, racialized, poor, gendered, disabled, and non–sexually normative subjects are granted secondary status if not excluded entirely from cultural nationalist constructions of the family. Tallying the affirmative attributes of cultural nationalism and extolling its upholding of familiar principles, Moraga also names institutionalized heterosexism, inbred machismo, and a lack of cohesive national strategy as pitfalls that always foreclose the possibility of unity.</p>
<p>Despite the heteronormative and homophobic renderings of the family in Latina/o cultural politics and  in the everyday lives of Latinas/os, struggles have been waged by queers (particularly gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgender individuals) to gain acceptance by families into which they were born as well as to forge kinship relations extending beyond biological ties. During the 1970s the San Francisco-based Gay Latino Alliance (GALA) was formed by gay and lesbian Latinos and Latinas seeking to forge an alternative family with others who shared not only a nonheterosexual identity but similar political sensibilities. In spite of the factors that brought them together, for some, belonging in GALA proved difficult, with women in particular feeling disrespected and silenced by male members. Thus the organization did not fulfill its goal of achieving a sense   of kinship rooted in democratic egalitarianism (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/roque-ramirez-horacio-n/">Roque Ramírez 2003</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rodriguez-richard-t/">R. T. Rodríguez 2009</a></strong>). While queer Latinas/os hold no other option but to create family with strangers given their banishment from their biological families, sociologist Katie L. Acosta (2013) has shown how  “sexually  nonconforming  Latinas”  both create and  negotiate their families of  origin. According to    a report released by the Williams Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/kastanis-angeliki-and-gary-j/">Kastanis and Gates 2013</a></strong>), an estimated 1.4 million Latinas/os in the United States identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT). Detailing an  estimated 146,000  Latinas/ os living in same-sex households, the report further notes that same-sex Latina/o couples are 1.7 times more likely than white same-sex couples to be raising children. Just as they choose those with whom they make family, many LGBT Latinas/os simultaneously hold on to relationships with their biological kin as a means of economic, social, or emotional sustenance.</p>
<p>The family is nothing short of central to scholarship on migration, which has long remained a vital strand  of Latina/o studies. And an unabashedly visible and influential undocumented rights movement emerging in the early twenty-first century in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/gonzales-alfonso/">Gonzales 2013</a></strong>) has shifted the terms of debate as immigration policies and laws have changed in tandem with more recent waves of migration from Latin American and the Caribbean. The current embrace of the family as an organizing principle by undocumented justice advocates, however, remarkably mirrors the efforts of Chicanas/os in the 1960s and 1970s. Identified by political scientist Amalia Pallares as “family activism” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/pallares-amalia/">2015</a></strong>), the move toward politicizing the family—in large part due to enforced laws dividing and displacing relatives—has enabled immigrant rights activists to make compelling claims for family reunification in order to supersede legal notions of citizenship that rigidly fix familial belonging in a narrowly conceived national frame.</p>
<p>From another trajectory, Latina/o immigrants living and working in the United States have forged and struggled to sustain cross-border family ties amid economic struggle. Examining the circumstances of transnational Salvadoran families, sociologist Leisy J. Abrego (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/abrego-leisy-j/">2014</a></strong>) has noted the complications stemming from the severed family ties generated by the need to provide monetary support for an extended familial support network. Indeed, remittances are what solidify the transnational kinship networks that are equally maintained and tested, given the overwhelming political economic circumstances experience by those providing them. As part of an increased awareness and concern for undocumented people who are positioned differently with respect to gender and sexuality, younger activists in an “undocuqueer” movement (which extends the goals of DREAMer actions that seek to grant rights to undocumented youths brought to the United States at an early age) embraced the notion of “queer familia” to rally undocumented LGBT Latinas/os. Fittingly, an organization named Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement took flight in 2014 in order, as its website announces, to “address, organize, educate and advocate for the issues that are important to the LGBTQ Latin@ community.”</p>
<p>Although scholarship on the Latina/o family has emerged chiefly from the province of the social sciences, the humanities and creative forms like literature and film have generated a stunning range of family representations that either complement or complicate the important work in, for example, sociology, anthropology, or political science. Cultural expressions, although sometimes discounted as fictional or said to be lacking empirical evidence, often broach a wide array of issues and concerns that may escape the purview of scholarly work.</p>
<p>Novels by Sandra Cisneros (<em>Caramelo</em>), Arturo Islas (<em>The Rain God </em>and <em>Migrant </em><em>Souls</em>), and Loida Maritza Pérez (<em>Geographies of Home</em>); short story collections by Helena María Viramontes (<em>The Moths and Other Stories</em>), Manuel Muñoz (<em>Zigzagger </em>and <em>The Faith Healer of Olive Avenue</em>), and Junot Díaz (<em>Drown</em>); plays by Cherríe Moraga (<em>Giving</em> <em>Up </em><em>the Ghost </em>and <em>The Hungry Woman: A Mexican Medea</em>); and memoirs by Piri Thomas (<em>Down These Mean Streets</em>), Judith Ortiz Cofer (<em>Silent Dancing: A Partial Remembrance of a Puerto Rican Childhood</em>), and Sandra and Sheila Ortiz Taylor (<em>Imaginary Parents: A Family Autobiography</em>)—all elegantly represent Latina/o families from a kaleidoscopic perspective. A number of films and videos—from narrative shorts to documentaries, and from feature-length to experimental productions—highlight the complexities of family dynamics in Latina/o cultural contexts. León Ichaso’s <em>El Súper </em>(1979), Harry Gamboa Jr.’s <em>Baby Kake </em>(1984), Darnell Martin’s <em>I Like It Like That </em>(1994), Gregory Nava’s <em>My Family </em>(1995), Laura Simón’s <em>Fear </em><em>and Learning at Hoover Elementary </em>(1997), Aaron Matthews’s <em>My American Girls: A Dominican Story </em>(2001), Patricia Riggen’s <em>Under </em><em>the Same Moon </em>(2007), Gloria La Morte and Paola Mendoza’s <em>Entre Nos </em>(2009), and Fro Rojas’s <em>Tio Papi </em>(2013) illustrate how a focus on the family necessarily encompasses deep concerns with immigration, gender, citizenship, sexuality, blackness, and economic disenfranchisement particular to transnational and translocal Latina/o communities whose origins stem from the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America.</p>
<p>Some scholars have expressed frustration with constantly equating Latina/o issues with family issues, insisting that the seemingly inextricable bond Latinas/os share with the family is an exaggeration bordering on stereotyping. There is no denying that the family persists across decades as a symbol and principle to which Latinas/os have turned for support or necessary reinvention. Yet the crucial function of the family for Latinas/os cannot be understated. And despite calls by white queer theorists to forget the family (a call that evidences an unfamiliarity with or disrespect for a decades-long history of writing emphasizing the vital meanings of familial ties for queers of color), the family will persist as a means to subvert racism, homophobia, sexism, and class discrepancies, while always running the risk of reproducing those very inequalities in its uncritical adaptations.</p>

Like the terms with which it most often  travels  (“race,”  “sex,”  and  “sexuality”),  gender is a complex and contested concept that,  although used quite widely and more and more  frequently  in both academic and nonacademic contexts, means significantly different things to different people and across different  institutional  locations.  Does  it  name an essential part of what it means to be a (<em>particular</em>) human being, a fundamental attribute that directs our sense of self and our outward presentation of that self, and that guides our interactions with others, especially our sexual attractions, encounters, and relationships?

And if much of the feminist scholarship produced by women of color over the past forty years has encouraged an intersectional approach to power, knowledge, embodiment, and subjectivity, what tools and collaborations are most conducive to approaching gender not monologically but as mutually constitutive with other categories of difference?</p>
<p>These are just a few of the epistemological and ontological questions generated by our efforts to apprehend, theorize, historicize, and denaturalize gender. While the questions may be unanswerable, at least in any  precise way, there is great value in pushing at and experimenting with them. Indeed, some of the most exciting and generative work produced in Latina/o studies as a field— and as the rubric we often use to name a constellation of individual but related fields such as Chicana/o studies and Puerto Rican studies—indexes the importance and politics of racialized gender (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/alarcon-norma/">Alarcón 1990</a></strong>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/saldivar-hull-sonia/"><strong>Saldívar-Hull 1991</strong></a>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/perez-emma-se/">E. Pérez 1999</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/fiol-matta-licia/">Fiol-Matta 2002</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/fiol-matta-licia-se/">2017</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rodriguez-juana-maria/">J. M. Rodríguez 2003</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rodriguez-juana-maria-se-2/">2014b</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/torres-eden-e/">E. Torres 2003</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/lima-lazaro/">Lima 2007</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rodriguez-richard-t/">R. T. Rodríguez 2009</a></strong>). Because the frequent objects of analysis that drive Latina/o studies—including, but not limited to, nation(alism), migration, culture, racial formation, and racialized embodiment—necessarily require facility with gender as a category, Latina/o studies has much to teach women’s studies and gender studies about gender’s imbrication with other processes productive of difference and power, and about the different vocabularies and cultural registers through which gender and sex travel and signify.</p>
<p>As Chicana feminist poststructuralist theorist Norma Alarcón argued some twenty-five years ago in her path-breaking essay, “The Theoretical Subject(s) of This Bridge Called My Back and Anglo-American Feminism” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/alarcon-norma/">1990</a></strong>), intersectional approaches to power, language, knowledge, and subjectivity have the potential to fundamentally challenge the persistence of the “gendered standpoint epistemology” undergirding “Anglo-American feminism.” As the title of her essay suggests, Alarcón was speaking not directly about Latina/o studies but about the kind of experiential and experimental “theory in the flesh” reflected in the watershed anthology <em>This Bridge Called My Back: Radical Writings by Women of Color</em>, co-edited by Cherríe Moraga and Gloria Anzaldúa (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/moraga-cherrie-and-gloria-e/">1981, 23</a></strong>). However, because of that anthology’s utmost importance for feminist scholars working in what we now call Latina/o studies, and because Alarcón herself can be considered a key theorist in Latina/o studies, that essay’s interventions are relevant to this discussion of how gender has been taken up in the field.</p>
<p>For Alarcón, <em>Bridge </em>powerfully exemplifies  that we do not become women in the same way: there is much variation in relation to the scripts, codes, experiences— including “psychic and material violence”—and processes that lead some to the category of “woman” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/alarcon-norma/"><strong>1990, 359</strong></a>). That difference compels more precise identifications, such as “woman of color,” and  suggests  that “one should not step into that category [of woman] nor that of man that easily or simply” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/alarcon-norma/">1990, 360</a></strong>). Such easy, simple identification  ignores  the  epistemological and ontological lessons that <em>Bridge </em>offers us about difference, intersectionality, (dis)identification, and complex alliances that exceed the terms of binary oppositions. And if Alarcón complicates  <em>identification  </em>in this way—even posing the provocation, “But what is a ‘woman,’ or a ‘man’ for that matter?” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/alarcon-norma/">1990, 361</a></strong>)—she also complicates the <em>subject </em>of feminist theory (gender) and its related commitment to “gendered standpoint epistemology”—a system that emphasizes women’s supposed “sexual difference” from men through a logic of oppositional counteridentification. One of the many effects of taking women as “the common denominator” across difference, she argues, is that “since the subject  of feminist theory and its single theme—gender—go largely unquestioned, its point of view tends to suppress and repress voices that question its authority” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/alarcon-norma/">1990, 359–60</a></strong>). This is why, according to Alarcón, in its first decade of circulation, <em>This Bridge </em><em>Called  My  Back  </em>had only a “cosmetic” impact on Anglo-American feminism (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/alarcon-norma/"><strong>1990, 357</strong></a>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the term “gender” that Alarcón used in her 1990 essay to name the counteridentificatory limitations of feminist studies and its form of standpoint epistemology is the very same term that has been used optimistically by some feminist scholars and  women’s studies (now “gender studies”) departments in their attempts to address those same, and related, limitations. That is, where Alarcón understands “gender” as a category of analysis to be structured through and through by a  binary opposition  (men  versus  women),  with all of the homogenizing that entails, other feminist theorists have looked to “gender” as a <em>flexible </em>category of analysis—one that can better attend to the insistence  by women of color on an intersectional approach to embodiment, subjectivity, and power, and one that can help challenge the primacy of “women” in the field of “women’s studies.” This optimistic and quite-familiar account of gender as the (newer) key term of feminist studies would situate it in contra-relation to the categories “women” (seen as at once too universalizing and narrow) and “sex” (conceptualized as the  biological stuff of the body). In that women-to-gender progress narrative, gender functions as a corrective—one that is more capacious than “women,” encapsulating as it does masculinity, femininity, androgyny, butch, and femme, to name a few gendered forms, especially as those embodied forms are differently racialized (e.g.  cha-cha femme, homeboy masculinity); more fluid than “sex” and thus more interesting as a site of transgression; and more available to the kind of intersectional analysis called for by many  of  the  scholars  traveling and traversing the interdisciplinary fields of “identity knowledges.” That narrative might also celebrate the much-deliberated and publicized name-changes  over the past two dozen years that saw many “women’s studies” courses and units (whether centers, programs, or departments) become some variation of “gender studies.” However, as Alarcón’s 1990 essay suggests, and as Robyn Wiegman persuasively argues in <em>Object Lessons</em>, that progressive self-narrative might be too  quick  to laud the political and knowledge transformations that the newer object “gender” is capable of bringing about: the “well-rehearsed failure [of the category ‘women’] to remain conceptually coherent and universally referential for <em>all </em>women within the field domain of Women’s Studies has inaugurated a turn toward a host of new investments organized increasingly under the sign of <em>gender</em>. . . . [T]he term has come to collate much of what the category of <em>women </em>is said to exclude: from men, masculinity, and queer sexualities to trans and intersex identities and analysis” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/wiegman-robyn/"><strong>2012, 38</strong></a>).</p>
<p>Likewise, the denaturalizing and destabilizing efforts to illuminate the ways that gender is <em>produced </em>by the repeated things we say, do, and perform may meanwhile unwittingly help <em>stabilize </em>sex as an indisputable fact of biology (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/fausto-sterling-anne/">Fausto-Sterling 1999</a></strong>). And even those attempts to unglue gender from binaries must recognize that we are increasingly expected to provide our “gender” on the countless bureaucratic forms we fill out—from medical intake forms to airline ticket purchases—by selecting one of two options (“Male” or “Female”). Moreover, gender can be harnessed institutionally in disciplining ways as something that we can be considered to <em>fail </em>at and as something that can be <em>corrected</em>. In 1973, the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </em>(DSM-3) infamously replaced the homosexual “disorder” with the gender identity disorder (GID). And the DSM-5 (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/american-psychiatric-association/"><strong>2013</strong></a>) has replaced GID with “gender dysphoria,” to diagnose “individuals who see and feel themselves to be a different gender than their assigned gender” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/american-psychiatric-association/">American Psychiatric Association 2013</a></strong>).</p>
<p>That Alarcón, Wiegman, and Fausto-Sterling— together with the DSM-5 example—remind us that there is nothing inherently liberating about “gender” means that we must continue to find ways of experimenting with and contesting its disciplining  effects and how it relates to other categories—probably most especially to “sex,” a term with which it is variously conflated, used interchangeably, distinguished, or,    in the case of Gayle Rubin (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rubin-gayle/">1975</a></strong>), positioned as two parts of the same “system.” One of the most important early explorations of the relationship between gender and sex was Rubin’s (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rubin-gayle/">1975</a></strong>) essay “The Traffic in Women: Notes on the ‘Political Economy’ of Sex.” Suturing gender to sex as a “sex/gender system,” Rubin captures the ways in which the natural and the biological were intervened upon by human activity in order to produce gender. Brilliantly weaving Lévi-Strauss’s anthropological work on kinship with Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis, Rubin argues that while psychoanalysis may be maddening in its failure to call for new arrangements  in light of its strong acknowledgment about the shame, humiliation, and pain of girlhood and womanhood (the shattering of the female ego), it is not only open  to intervention by feminists, but indispensable to the study of gender. Likewise, Rubin’s work should be seen as a resource for Latina/o studies, indispensable <em>and </em>open to intervention, and vice-versa. Even the interrogation of the perplexing positioning of sex in relation to gender, a question to which I will return shortly, can be enriched by considering the ways that Latina/o studies and other bodies of critical ethnic studies scholarship negotiate the shifting meanings of—and relationship between—“race” and “ethnicity,” terms that are variously (and confusingly) deployed as either interchangeable synonyms or as coupled terms whose differentiation depends on an inherited notion that race is more associated with skin color, biology, and power relations (just as sex is associated with genitalia, chromosomes, and other received criteria of supposedly measurable embodied difference), while, in contradistinction, ethnicity (like gender) would appear to be associated more with the social and cultural. While race/ethnicity by no means operates analogously to sex/gender, the shared historical and political entanglements of signification of those two sets of terms remains unexplored.</p>
<p>From the vantage point of the mid-1970s, when Rubin wrote “The Traffic in Women” (first as part of an undergraduate thesis), these proposals were radical. She had essentially appropriated some of the vocabulary and insights from Marxist thought—historical conditions, human intervention—and called for a theory of sex-gender, one that would neither subsume sex/gender to economic conditions, nor divorce it from those con- ditions; one that had the historical breadth to investigate why the oppression of women predated capitalism; and one that offered some conclusions about how to change the social relations that (re)generate the oppression of women. Rubin’s own radical dream was “of an androgynous and genderless (though not sexless) society, in which one’s sexual anatomy is irrelevant to who one is, what one does, and with whom one makes love” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rubin-gayle/">1975, 204</a></strong>).</p>
<p>Whether one agreed with Rubin’s call for a genderless society (and many feminists did and do), her essay helped encourage the continued critical exploration of the relationship between sex  and  gender  within the fields of feminist studies and (critical) gender studies. Such exploration has generated, especially since the 1980s, a rich archive of immanent critique, a practice that Judith Butler describes as “seek[ing] to provoke critical examination of the basic vocabulary of the movement of thought to which it belongs” (1999, vii). That self-reflexive process of experimentation has sharpened our understanding of identity, subjectivity, embodiment, power, performativity, intersectionality, and social relations—all of which are particularly apt sites from which to consider gender’s influence and influences. Aiming not at the “Truth” of gender, immanent critique approaches gender as a contested and dynamic construct because, as Joan W. Scott cautions  in the opening to her influential essay, “Gender: A Useful Category of Analysis,” “Those who would codify the meanings of words fight a losing battle, for words, like the ideas and things they are meant to signify, have a history” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/scott-joan/">1986, 1053</a></strong>).</p>
<p>Given the incredibly rich body of primary cultural production by Latin@ artists, writers, and performers who innovatively experiment with the complexity of various racialized forms of femininity, gender fucking, masculinity, trans*, and gender policing, Latina/o studies scholars who analyze that material have much to teach us about the kind of history for which Scott calls. Largely because of the momentum created by <em>This Bridge Called My Back</em>, and together with the growth of independent publishing houses geared toward feminist and/or Latin@ publications, the 1980s was a particularly productive decade for culturally specific literary representations of Latin@ gender. One of the most important of these treatments is arguably Sandra Cisneros’s <em>House on Mango Street </em>(<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/cisneros-sandra/"><strong>1984</strong>)</a>, a collection of vignettes that reads as a novel and that in the most nuanced and three-dimensional ways depicts gendered curtailment of mobility in the lives of girls and women—as well as the burdens of racialized masculinity for boys and men. What makes this book a classic is Cisneros’s artful narrative technique: we learn about the world of Mango Street through the point of view of a young woman, Esperanza, who has not yet developed the critical tools and vocabulary for critically reflecting on the pleasures, injuries, threats, and desires that are everywhere across the book saturated with gender codes, policing, and hierarchies. This limited point of view allows Cisneros to hint at gendered violence, rendering it suggestively rather than explicitly. The upshot of this technique is that we, the readers, must fill in the missing details of stories, but also, more significantly, Esperanza’s youth— her naïveté and innocence—is clearly meant to bring into sharper (affective) relief the disempowering and confusing network of social norms and emotional  and physical violations that circumscribe gendered life on Mango Street.</p>
<p>In closing, I want to reverse the usual direction of primary/secondary material by suggesting that Latina/o studies might approach the form and content of <em>House on Mango Street </em>not only as a rich collection of vignettes about gender, but as a model for how we might attend to some of the limitations I’ve been addressing in relation to the disciplining effects of gender. That is, Cisneros’s capaciousness—her refreshing willingness to refute the “Truth” of gender, her remarkable ability to allow gender as a category to be three-dimensional and unpredictable as a source of <em>both </em>pain <em>and </em>pleasure, her respect for her readers’ agency in inviting them to fill in where the narrator does not go—all of these can help us learn from the lessons that Alarcón is right to say we have been missing.</p>

As such, Latina/o workers (referred to as “Hispanic” by the U.S. government), constitute over 15 percent of  the labor force in the United States, and nearly half of the immigrant workforce (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/u-2/">U.S. Department of Labor 2012</a></strong>). They are over-represented in traditionally low-wage occupations such as food preparation, building maintenance, farming, and construction. In 2011, Latina/o immigrant workers earned only 77 percent of what their  native-born  counterparts  earned  (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/bureau-of-labor-statistics/">Bureau of Labor Statistics 2012</a></strong>). These inequities are in part explained by lower levels of human capital, including low levels of English proficiency and educational attainment, in particular for those of Mexican origin (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/duncan-brian-v/">Duncan, Hotz, and Trejo 2006</a></strong>). Institutional barriers have further multiplied the disadvantage that Mexican Americans face, creating what Edward Telles and Vilma Ortiz (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/telles-edward-e/">2008</a></strong>) refer to as “generations  of exclusion.” This disadvantage contrasts starkly with the positive selection of much smaller groups of other professional Latinas/os, such as Colombian and Puerto Rican engineers, who nonetheless have    contradictory experiences as “privileged marginal migrants” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rincon-lina/"><strong>Rincón 2015, 213</strong></a>).</p>
<p>The predominant conditions of low-wage work for Latinas/os in the United States reveal striking disadvantages. For example, a national study of low-wage workers in the nation’s three largest cities found that foreign-born Latinas/os had the highest rate of minimum-wage violations (35 percent), six times that of U.S.-born whites. Latina workers fared worse than their male counterparts (40 versus 24 percent) (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/bernhardt-annette-ruth-milkman-nik-theodore-douglas-hekathorn-mirabai-auer-james-defilippis-ana-luz-gonzalez-victor-narro-jason-perelshteyn-diana-polson-and-michael-spiller/">Bernhardt et al. 2009</a></strong>). Research on Mexican and Central American immigrants confirm that undocumented workers face more hazardous workplace conditions and are less likely to be compensated for their risk exposure (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/orrenius-pia-m/">Orrenius and Zavodny 2009</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/hall-matthew-and-emily-greenman/">Hall and Greenman 2014</a></strong>). Foreign-born Latinas/os also represent a disproportionate share of fatal occupational injuries (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/loh-katherine-and-scott-richardson/">Loh and Richardson 2004</a></strong>). Sexual harassment and assault on the job have been a major problem for Latinas, compounding what is already a violent journey for those who clandestinely migrated (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/southern-poverty-law-center/">Southern Poverty Law Center 2009</a></strong>). Indigenous migrants have become an increasingly significant component of migrant labor flows across the southern U.S. border. These workers face particular linguistic challenges and are targets for racial exclusion from both within and beyond the Latina/o community (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/holmes-seth/">Holmes 2013</a></strong>).</p>
<p>The range of industries in  which Latina/o  workers are concentrated often fall outside the law. For example, Latinas/os are over-represented in day labor and other sectors of the informal economy. Abel Valenzuela and colleagues’ (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/valenzuela-abel-jr-3/">2006</a></strong>) survey found that nationwide, 87 percent of day laborers hailed from Mexico and Central America. These workers face an epidemic of being mis-classified as <em>independent contractors</em>, who by definition do not qualify for employee protections under key federal and state law (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/nelp-national-employment-law-project/">NELP 2009</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/mukhija-vinit-and-anastasia-loukaitou-sideris/">Mukhija and Loukaitou-Sideris  2014</a></strong>).  Nearly  half  of  domestic  workers are women of color, and over half of housecleaners are Latinas (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/burnham-linda-and-nik-theodore/">Burnham and Theodore 2012</a></strong>). In most states, these domestic workers lack the same enforceable protections as other workers do for wage and hour standards, workers’ compensation in the event of injury, and against employer retaliation. In the fields, where Latina/o workers also predominate, most states also exclude farm-workers from the same provisions for overtime and collective bargaining (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/perea-juan-f-se/">Perea 2011</a></strong>). In sum, Latina/o labor provides a direct lens for understanding the two-tiered system of labor protection and rights access.</p>
<p>These inequities have been a flashpoint when considering undocumented immigrants in the United States, the largest portions of whom hail from Latin America, including Mexico (59 percent), Central America (11 percent), and South America (7 percent) (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/passel-jeffrey-and-dvera-cohn/">Passel and  Cohn  2009</a></strong>).  While  undocumented  legal  status is not the only factor driving workplace exploitation (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/narro-victor/">Narro 2013</a></strong>), it does act as a “precarity multiplier” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/gleeson-shannon/">Gleeson 2014</a></strong>). In 1986 the Immigration Reform and Control Act provided amnesty for nearly three million individuals, while also instituting a policy of employer sanctions. While initially supportive of the policy, the AFL-CIO ultimately rejected employer sanctions, in part given employer’s frequent use of them as a tool to retaliate against employees (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/hamlin-rebecca/">Hamlin 2008</a></strong>). Although undocumented workers qualify for a range of protections, they also “face numerous practical impediments to accessing these rights” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/gordon-jennifer/">Gordon 2014, 137</a></strong>). Some workers who can show that they are victims of crime may qualify for a U or  T  visa, which were  created by the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (VTVPA) in 2000. However, unequivocally proving eligibility and gaining certification from a law enforcement agency can be extremely difficult (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/lakhani-sarah-morando/">Lakhani 2013</a></strong>). Temporary Protected Status has provided short-term deportation relief and work authorization to    340,000 individuals, including significant numbers of Salvadorans (212,000), Hondurans (64,000) and Nicaraguans (3,000) (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/messick-madeline-and-claire-bergeron/">Messick and Bergeron 2014</a></strong>). This eighteen-month-long status, however is not a panacea, and also generates a context of legal violence that can negatively affect the labor market outcomes of these workers and the well-being of their families and broader communities (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/menjivar-cecilia-and-leisy-j/"><strong>Menjívar and Abrego 2012</strong></a>).</p>
<p>The challenges facing Latina/o workers have  been at the center of the evolving U.S. labor movement. Latina/o immigrant workers (alongside their Filipina/o brothers and sisters) formed the basis of the iconic United Farmworkers movement, and Cesar Chavez has been the enduring (in some ways reimagined) face of immigrant worker rights for years. However, the U.S. labor movement delayed formally accepting the full rights and inclusion of immigrant workers, including Latinas/ os. Aside from their place in farmworker struggles, Latinas/os came to be recognized as core elements of the service industry (such as the Service Employees International Union [SEIU]’s Justice for Janitors campaign) and the building trades (as in the National Day Labor Organizing Network) (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/milkman-ruth/">Milkman 2006</a></strong>). Latina/o  leaders such as Enrique Fernandez (UNITE-HERE!), Eliseo Medina (SEIU), Ana Avendaño (AFL-CIO), and many others have ascended in the labor movement flanks. The swelling strength of the Latina/o labor movement both within traditional labor unions and through newly formed worker centers and coalitions (including the new Change to Win federation), as well as other migrant-led organizations (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/fine-janice/">Fine 2006</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/pallares-amalia-and-nilda-flores-gonzalez-eds/">Pallares and Flores-González 2010</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/voss-kim-and-irene-bloemraad-eds/">Voss and Bloemraad 2011</a></strong>), was a key factor in driving the iconic protests that erupted in 2006 in response to the proposed Border Protection, Antiterrorism and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005 (HR 4437), which would have further criminalized undocumented migrants.</p>
<p>The labor struggles of Latina/o workers have also been an important aspect of the broader immigrant rights movement, as well as being at the heart of calls for deportation relief and a path to citizenship. Popular rationales of immigrant rights often point to the labor value of migrants and the costly nature of enforcement (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/bosniak-linda/">Bosniak 2002</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/baker-cristales-beth/">Baker-Cristales 2009</a></strong>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/gleeson-shannon-se/"><strong>Gleeson 2015</strong></a>). Common slogans such as “they come here to work” and “we are workers,  not  criminals” focus  on  immigrants as economic producers, rather than felons, purported terrorists, and the unemployed. The DREAM Act, first introduced in 2001, failed to garner significant congressional support. Had it passed, the act would have provided a path to citizenship for high school graduates seeking higher education. In the wake of failed attempts at broader comprehensive immigration reform, President Obama issued an executive action, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  (DACA),  which  called for the  inclusion  of  undocumented  immigrant  youth in large part due to the economic boon these educated workers would provide the ailing economy (American Immigration Council 2013; National Immigration Law Center 2014). The subsequent Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) would have provided eligible formerly undocumented immigrants with work authorization and was billed as an “economic development” strategy for the nation (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/oakford-patrick/">Oakford 2014</a></strong>). DAPA, though limited in its reach, was blocked by the courts along with an expanded version of DACA. These policies, however, would have left out millions of ineligible undocumented workers. Economic rationales for reform are politically salient and critically necessary to achieve legislative success. They also resonate strongly with the U.S. tradition of neoliberal citizenship, which is tightly tied to the market, and thus valorize the “self-reliant, independent <em>homo economicus </em>underlying the ideal model of the worthy citizen” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/volpp-leti/">Volpp 2014, 82</a></strong>).</p>
<p>Intersectional scholars have for decades inserted critical questions into our understanding of labor and power, especially as they relate to women, racial and sexual minorities, and immigrants (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/zavella-patricia/"><strong>Zavella 1987</strong></a>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/glenn-evelyn-nakano/">Glenn 1992</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/manalansan-martin-f/">Manalansan 2006</a></strong>). For example, the official focus on “workers, not criminals,” as many campaigns emphasize, obscures the ways in which the penal system exacerbates wage and employment inequality, especially for African American and Latino men of color (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/western-bruce-and-becky-pettit/">Western and Pettit 2005</a></strong>). Welfare reform policies of the mid-1990s tied work to social provisions and removed many legal permanent residents (many of whom were Latina women) from eligibility. In conjunction  with the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (both of 1996), the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Acts (PRWORA) (also of 1996) brought together the ideals of punitive immigration and welfare reform. PRWORA solidified the supremacy of paid wage work over other forms of labor in the private sphere and excised noncitizen immigrant women entirely from the social safety net. Critics argue that by pushing women with little support for childcare or with little training into “workfare” in order to qualify for public assistance, Latinas/os were blocked from pathways for social mobility (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/marchevsky-alejandra-and-jeanne-theoharis/">Marchevsky and Theoharis 2006</a></strong>). In parallel fashion, the sweeping changes in immigration policy at this time paved the way for local interior enforcement programs such as 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (which created voluntary agreements with local jurisdictions) and later the Secure Communities program, which made this cooperation more compulsory. Both policies, which have seen a revival under the Trump presidency despite previous legal challenges, are not officially focused on workplace policy. However, their impact has immersed the day to day lives of Latina/o immigrant workers in racialized surveillance and fear that a mundane traffic infraction en route to work would result in certain deportation (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/lacayo-a/">Lacayo 2010</a></strong>). These policies, alongside mass media constructions of Latinas/os as a demographic, political, and economic threat, further marginalizes Latinas/os in the United States (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/santa-ana-otto/">Santa Ana 2002</a></strong>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/chavez-leo-r-se-2/"><strong>Chavez 2008</strong></a>).</p>
<p>Amidst these contested struggles for recognition, no perspective on Latina/o labor is complete without a global and transnational lens to understand the causes and consequences of migrant labor. For example, Saskia Sassen (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/sassen-saskia/">1988</a></strong>) points to the importance of export of global labor capital from the United States to Latin America and its impact on subsequent migration flows. This “foreign direct investment” came with a cost. For example, the proliferation of maquiladoras at Mexico’s northern border largely employed young females, many of whom would become victims of <em>feminicidio </em>(<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/fregoso-rosa-linda-and-cynthia-bejarano/">Fregoso and Bejarano 2009</a></strong>). Meanwhile, the wages of Latina/o labor in the United States frequently support extended households here and in sending communities of origin. The United States is the primary sender of remittances, with $22 billion sent to Mexico in 2012, and another $5.4 billion to Guatemala, $4.6 billion to Colombia, and $4.2 billion to El Salvador (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/cohn-dvera-ana-gonzalez-barrera-and-danielle-cuddington/">Cohn, Gonzalez-Barrera, and Cuddington 2013</a></strong>;<strong> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/migration-policy-institute/">Migration Policy Institute 2014</a></strong>).</p>
<p>Globalization has shaped labor-organizing efforts across Latin America. For example, in Central America, transnational activist campaigns led largely by student groups became critical to the anti-sweatshop movement (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/anner-mark-s/">Anner 2011</a></strong>). Transnational resistance was also crucial to opposing U.S. foreign policy during the civil war in El Salvador, and migrant workers continue to play a major role in the current political scene, often mixing their civic engagement here and afar (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/coha/">COHA 2014</a></strong>). Today, transnational advocacy for the rights of Latina/o workers in the United States has implicated a range of institutional targets, including efforts to hold the sending state accountable for the rights of their co-nationals working abroad. The Mexican government’s move into a realm of “active engagement” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/delano-alexandra/">Délano 2011</a></strong>) was prompted in large part by the work of grassroots migrant-led organizations and unions with a strong immigrant worker presence, such as the United Food and Commercial Workers. They have demanded protection for Mexican immigrant workers in the United States, as well as increased accountability on the part of the Mexican government for non-migrant workers working for multinational corporations such as Wal-Mart (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/bada-xochitl-and-shannon-gleeson/">Bada and Gleeson 2015</a></strong>).</p>
<p>In sum, as the field of Latina/o studies considers the role of “labor,” it will need to grapple with questions of whose labor counts, what it is worth, and the relationship of work to political and social membership. Non-economic forms of labor, including reproductive and emotional labor, should be valued, just as its commodification should be critiqued. As the Latina/o diaspora grows, it will also become imperative to consider labor across the borders of identity, the law, and the nation. Traditional forms of labor relations, and labor representation, will continue to be provide inadequate paradigms for understanding the reality of Latina/o work in the twenty-first century.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The term “race” as used in contemporary discourse, whether academic or demotic, purportedly refers to the distinct ancestry of a differentiated human population. Exactly what specific collection of features in a person’s ancestry determines his or her race seems less easy to discern from current usage. Nor can we always tell whether the elements involved in assigning a racial label to one group will correspond identically to the characteristics used in classifying another group under a different racial category. For instance, on May 12, 1977, the Office of Budget Statistics issued “Directive 15: Race and Ethnicity Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting,” which classifies the U.S. population into five segments according to origins. Unlike the Asian, Black, Native American, and White subdivisions, when it came to the “Hispanic” segment, which encompassed people of “Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American or other Spanish culture or origin,” the classification brought together various subgroups “regardless of race” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/background-development-of-directive-15-appendix/">“Background: Development of Directive 15,” 1994</a></strong>). U.S. Hispanics thus became an “ethnicity”as opposed to the other four subdivisions that consisted of “races” in the official taxonomy that the U.S. Census Bureau would recognize. Yet, one wonders how Asian Americans can constitute a single “race” given that the configuration of ancestries and phenotypes in their midst appears at least equally diverse.</p>
<p>While speakers in general, from specialists to lay-people, tend to proceed as if consensus exists as to what race is, the extent to which they share a common frame of reference seems unclear (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/hannaford-ivan/">Hannaford 1996, 3</a></strong>). Based on the state of scientific knowledge at the time, in 1951 UNESCO issued a statement disavowing race as a reliable marker of biological differences among branches of the human population. Over half a century ago, biological anthropologist Frank B. Livingstone argued persuasively that the concept of race had been “overworked” as a measure of “human variability,” noting that “many characteristics which were thought to be racial have been found in many widely separated populations” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/livingstone-frank-b/">1962, 279–81</a></strong>). With the spread of information prompted by geneticists like Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/cavalli-sforza-luigi/">2000</a></strong>) about the migration of genes as our species populated the globe starting from a common point of departure in Africa, the biological commonality of humans has become uncontroversial— hence the currency of the mantra “Race is socially constructed.” Oddly, even while repeating this mantra, learned observers may still be found to reproach particular individuals or groups for failing to identify themselves racially in a manner that is supposedly more accurate or authentic. Dominicans, for instance, may find themselves admonished by other “people of color” for insufficiently stressing blackness as part of their identity. The simultaneous tendency to deny and yet affirm the existence of race corresponds to the peculiar developments that brought the word into the lexicons of modern European languages less than five centuries ago. A nebulous term for a set of discursive practices as well as lived experiences, “race” remains ubiquitous and contentious. In the contemporary United States, for instance, it crops up in discussions of national politics, law enforcement, educational standards, immigration, employment, popular culture, and entertainment, among other areas of prevailing social concern.</p>
<p>As a field that tackles the histories, cultures, politics, arts, social  developments,  and  overall  experience of people of Hispanic descent, Latina/o studies connects inexorably with racial matters. This branch of ethnic studies owes its birth to the racialized rendition of   the U.S. experience, which, until the 1960s, had largely omitted the words and deeds of the non-white sectors of the country’s population from the conventional founding narratives of the nation. Additionally, those in the demography that Latina/o studies encompasses— namely, people ancestrally linked to Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Iberian Peninsula—hail precisely from the regions of the world where race first acquired its social significance. People of Hispanic descent inherit, as victims and perpetrators, equally virulent Spanish and English traditions of racial aggression. In view of this composite heritage, Latina/o studies offers a suitable platform for undertaking the sort of meditation that might one day help us transcend the cul-de-sac that racial conversations have reached in the United States at a prematurely announced “post-racial” moment. For instance, 2014, a year characterized by much lethal police brutality against unarmed minority males, closed with the killing of two New York City police officers, Asian American Wenjian Liu and Latino Rafael Ramos, at the hands of a vengeful African American civilian angered by the prior police killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, black males from Missouri and New York, respectively. Former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani and other right-wing militants used the occasion to blame concerned citizens who had protested unjustified lethal force by law-enforcement officers for presumably creating the “anti-police” environment that led to the deaths of the two officers.</p>
<p>In light of this conceptually and emotionally muddled climate, with influential voices venting antipathies instead of aiming for clarity, National Institute for Latino Policy (NiLP) president Angelo Falcón (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/falcon-angelo/">2014</a></strong>) decried the “broken  discourse,  the loss  of  a language adequate enough to connect racially discordant voices.” He noted how, in the absence of a meaningful racial vocabulary, we “desperately try to connect via the simplicity of the hashtag.” Falcón appealed to sobriety and reason, urging observers on all sides to find a way of speaking that might “bring us to a better understanding of the bigger picture within which we will all thrive or, ultimately, destroy ourselves.” Perhaps it behooves Latina/o studies scholars more than colleagues in any other field to act upon Falcón’s appeal with the hope of formulating and securing a salutary, inclusive language that enlightens rather than obscures. This language ought to overcome the temptation to refry the clichés that inevitably arise when speaking from the midst of the social pathologies that racial matters generate without attempting to unearth the cause of the pathologies in the first place.</p>
<p>A dogma begotten by the colonial transaction over five centuries ago, racism emerged to address the moral transgressions that Christian nations incurred when they claimed leadership roles in imperial domination. The conquest and colonization of the Americas involved depriving overseas populations of their lands, destroying their societies, reducing Indigenous peoples to backbreaking, coerced toil in labor camps, inclemently punishing whoever did not satisfy the production quota expected of the captives, and perpetrating genocide against any group that opposed the colonial order. In other words, the colonial transaction put conquering Christians in the position of having to do unto others much that their creed forbade them to do. Because of that moral quandary, Christians ushered in a new chapter in the history of imperial domination. Unlike previous stages in the history of conquest based on social domination and enslavement, the one marshaled by Christians insisted on representing their violent plundering of foreign societies as charitable, often depicting the injured parties as heathens rescued from the evil of their ancestral beliefs and customs. This new domination required conquerors to dehumanize the subject peoples so as to render them ineligible for Christian piety, thereby ennobling or, at the very least, justifying, the aggression perpetrated against them. The conquerors waged psychological warfare daily against the vanquished, while the apologists of the new economy assembled a colonial epistemology that construed the conquered as debased beings deserving of their plight due to moral, mental, spiritual, aesthetic, and physical inferiorities. Construing the vanquished as specimens of a lesser form of humanity persisted even after many adopted the religion of their masters and relinquished the presumed heathenism of their forebears. For instance, African-descended San Martín de Porres (1579– 1639), a lay brother of the Dominican Order in the Vice-royalty of Peru, occupied a second tier in his religious order. His race barred him from full membership. This reason was also the impediment that stymied the ascent of many Indigenous servants of the Lord, regardless of the strength of their faith or holiness of their actions.</p>
<p>In more recent times, when trying to express the indignation and malaise produced by the racially motivated murder of nine black parishioners at Mother Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, during a Bible study session on June 17, 2015, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch called the killings a “barbaric crime” with “no place in our country . . . no place in a civilized society” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/office-of-the-attorney-general/">Office of the Attorney General 2015</a></strong>). One wonders whether the attorney general subscribes to too benign a view of civilized society. Different kinds of ingredients contribute to different civilizations. The idea that people from certain ancestral origins, when not used for slave labor, constitute an obstacle to society’s advancement was a core ingredient to the colonial civilizations that emerged in the Americas.    Racial disparagement and the extreme violence that has often accompanied it have not only had a “place in our country” for centuries, but have also figured as a building block of virtually every “civilized society” that emerged in the Western Hemisphere in the wake of  the colonial transaction. Twenty-one-year-old Dylann Roof, the white man who perpetrated the killings, did not target his victims randomly but did so with a clear sense of who belonged legitimately in the United States and who did not (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/apuzzo-matt/">Apuzzo 2015</a></strong>). When, prior to pulling the trigger so many times, he voiced the belief that blacks were “taking over our country” and “raping our [white] women,” he drew from the body of negrophobic thought to which many of the most cultivated minds of Europe and the Americas had continuously subscribed for more than four centuries. The deaths of these nine African Americans proved shocking because of the juxtaposition of violence with prayer in a supposedly safe space: the church.</p>
<p>It shocks no less to see the 2013 law issued by the Dominican Republic’s Constitutional Court to suspend the citizenship  status  of  nearly  250,000  Dominicans of Haitian ancestry. Looking at the Court’s ruling, one easily discerns Dominican justices under the spell of negrophobic ideology that has pervaded the discourse of nationality and cultural identity in the region since the colonial period. These justices—irrespective of their phenotype—were most likely identifying with the Hispanic component of their mixed ancestry. They feared the exponential growth of a segment of the population that, according to consensus at home and abroad, is supposedly “blacker” than Dominicans. The cultural instincts of the judges seem to have been influenced by notions of race and nation promoted by former president Joaquín Balaguer, who, from 1930 to 1961, uninterruptedly served the tyrant Rafael Leónidas Trujillo. Trujillo’s regime had instituted white supremacy as central to Dominican identity. Apart from just doing his job    as an ideologue of the dictatorship, the negrophobic Balaguer had valid intellectual grounds for embracing the Caucasian ideal. As a man  of  letters who  looked  to the great thinkers of Latin America and the Iberian cultural tradition as a whole, he had learned the white supremacist creed taught by such seminal nineteenth-century authors as Juan Bautista Alberdi (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/alberdi-juan-bautista/">1966</a></strong>) and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/sarmiento-domingo-faustino/">1915</a></strong>). These thinkers had equated Latin American progress with the prevalence of whiteness. The civil death experienced by the denationalized Haitian-descended Dominicans did not come from overt violence; it emerged from the pens of well-groomed, mostly mixed-race (mulatto) jurists worried about Dominicans of a despised ancestry supposedly “taking over” the country. They are ostensibly the Dylann Roofs whose weapons do not spew bullets and yet still leave behind a legacy of despair, trauma, fear, and alienation.</p>
<p>Racism has been and remains one of the core constituents of American civilization. We must own up to that reality and be aware of its endemic presence in our lives. Doing so is a prerequisite for taking the first steps in the quest toward achieving a post-racial society—if that is indeed what is desired. Without admitting to the horror of our beginnings as a civilization (namely the theft, destruction, murder, and mistreatment that it took to build our modern societies in the hemisphere), we will go nowhere. We will continue to restrict the field of our social action to responding to <em>individual </em>expressions of the problem rather than to addressing its root causes. Punishing racist acts may satisfy the dictates of the law and perhaps offers partial consolation to victims and their loved ones, but it does not address the problem that triggers the acts in the first place. Latina/o studies scholars working specifically on racial matters are uniquely poised to debate and understand the   genesis of racism, as well as dissect its forms of implementation. The onus is on us to help interrupt and disable the psychological and social mechanisms that have trained vast groups of people to withhold empathy and stanch  a sense of commonality across ancestral difference in their rapport with others.</p>
<p>Racism does not cease the moment the government of a state or nation withdraws its support for, or even criminalizes, the abuse of a racialized other. This abuse may have been entrenched in law, neglected, or ignored, or even encouraged and sanctioned by leaders and the institutions they represent. The racist who has internalized as “natural” the social superiority and ability to control people of other ancestries will most likely react with confusion or rage when confronted with the loss of such capacities. The ensuing backlash will most likely increase the vulnerability of those enjoying only <em>de jure </em>equality. Given that the specter of racism is persistent and intergenerational in the United States, we should not permit ourselves the folly of recognizing it only when invoking a racial lexicon or other sets of discursive practices that allude to ancestral difference in a transparent, familiar, or easy way. We should attend to its lurking presence in policies that may have a noxious daily effect, especially on people of color; these can include the closing of public schools, continued income inequality, and the practice of “stop and frisk” championed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. In 2015, for instance, roughly a year after completing his term as the top city official, Bloomberg could not possibly have forgotten the court order that demanded the cessation of the policy given its multiple flaws and transgressions. It had violated the law by racially profiling city residents; the overwhelming majority of the people stopped were minority males (read African Americans and Latinos). It had squandered public funds in its failure to reduce crime since the people of color arbitrarily searched    by the police usually showed no sign of involvement in any criminal activity. No less important, Bloomberg’s policy further corroded the relationship between non-white communities and the police; this atmosphere of distrust worsened racial relations in the city overall. On February 5, 2015, Bloomberg offered an audience of over four hundred people at the Aspen Institute his solution to the problem of gun violence in the country: have law enforcement focus on the actions of minority males, aged fifteen through twenty-five (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/herchenroeder-karl/">Herchenroeder 2015</a></strong>). It is as if he had learned nothing at all from the contrary evidence offered in the policy’s aftermath.</p>
<p>In a similar way, new awareness of voter ID laws gained currency in U.S. politics when Barack Obama, the son of a white Midwestern woman and a black Kenyan man, rose to political prominence as a credible presidential hopeful. His ascent to that top leadership role energized unprecedented numbers of citizens from communities of color to exercise their right to vote and participate in other civic processes like campaigning and fundraising. In 2008 and 2012, however, it became clear that the new laws had acted to suppress voter turn-out, in an eerie parallel to the poll  taxes  and  literacy test requirements of the segregated South. This was the same vociferous racism that had kept Strom Thurmond, the ardent negrophobe who fathered a child by a young black domestic working for his family, reelected as a U.S. senator for South Carolina until the age of one hundred. More recently, the anti-immigrant, anti-Mexican, anti-Muslim, and broadly Hispanophobic rhetoric displayed by celebrity business tycoon Donald Trump invigorated his campaign as he vied for the Republican Party’s presidential nomination in 2015–16.</p>
<p>Many Latina/o scholars have tackled the thorny issue of racism within and among U.S. Hispanic populations, pointing to internalized negrophobia, anti-Indigenous sentiments,  tensions  with  other  groups,  and white supremacist tendencies that inform everything from slang to hairstyling. Their findings shore up crucial areas that require further investigation. Racism, for example, operates as a pedagogy that informs the thoughts, feelings, and actions of whole societies, not just individuals. Extricating it from these societies requires an effort at least equivalent to that which racial pedagogues invested in its conception, inculcation, and maintenance. While prejudices tend to originate in the master class, which is also the primary beneficiary of their existence, nothing bars them from trickling down to the marginal and subaltern groups, since structures of socialization and schooling almost invariably come from above. The oppressed are not immune to the logic and ethos of the oppressors; nor can they assume that their manner of fighting racism will automatically be free of the danger of replicating racist paradigms and practices.</p>
<p>Overall, inquiries that privilege racism as the occasion wherein the abstraction of race achieves materiality, approached from the perspectives of political economy and intellectual history, have the best potential for fleshing out the subject in a manner that can advance the conversation broadly and contribute to the empowerment of diverse populations. Unlearning intolerance, especially by discarding automatic assumptions and deconstructing stereotypes, may help restore empathy and compassion across stark categories of difference. People whose ancestors have suffered dehumanization must find ways of shaking off the presumption that they are racially on the “right side” simply by virtue of their descent from victims rather than perpetrators of barbarity and destruction. As a body of knowledge, a dogma, and a set of social practices, racism pervades the atmosphere of entire societies, enveloping the vanquished no less pervasively than the vanquishers. It therefore behooves those historically inhabiting the victim’s flank to remain  alert to  their own  potential  for disempowering others as well as themselves. They ought to delink from internalized racism while affirming their ability and willingness to refrain from doing unto others as has been done unto them. Only with the humility and the forbearance that these existential exercises entail can we hope to envision an eventual post-racial society.</p>
<p>With this goal in mind, one could argue that the United States  can  epitomize  greatness writ large  only if it musters up the humility to be honest about its racist past. To be able to work toward the amelioration of social relations requires a recognition that awful events took place in the process of creating this grand civilization; that the ascent and well-being of some occurred  at the expense and suffering of many. Finding a way to own up to that past and create a climate of respect for the descendants of victims and perpetrators alike remains both an imperative and a challenge for inhabitants of this country and the rest of the Americas.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As numerous scholars have noted, there is long-standing resistance in Latina/o and Chicana/o studies, in particular, to writing about religion (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/espinosa-gaston-and-mario-t/">Espinosa and García 2008</a>). Some of this resistance derives from the origins of Chicana/o and Boricua studies, which were deeply imbued with Marxist trends and influences, but it also has to do with the historical stigmatization  of Indigenous and African traditions in the Americas. Further, the association between Christianity and colonialism leads some scholars to regard Catholicism as a tool  for  the oppression  of  Latina/o  communities by colonial forces. Such perspectives minimize the contemporary centrality of religion to Latina/o populations, as well as the ways Latinas/os have used religion to resist oppression in a variety of settings.</p>
<p>The majority of Latinas/os in the United States are Catholic (55 percent), often with an infusion of Indigenous and African practices and devotions. However, the Catholic share of the Latina/o population is rapidly declining, as the Pew Research Center (2014) report on <em>The Shifting Religious Identity of Latinos in the United States </em>indicates. In 2014, one quarter of the Latina/o population identified as former Catholics who had become Evangelical Protestants or unaffiliated with a religious tradition. The largest growth in the twenty-first century has been among unaffiliated Latinas/os (18 percent) followed by Evangelical Protestants (16 percent). Mainline Protestants make up 5 percent of the Latina/o population (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/pew-research-center-se-3/">Pew Research Center 2014</a>).</p>
<p>The experiences of Latinas/os in the United States are shaped by historical legacies that marked Catholics as backward, lazy, and primitive. This American narrative of “Latin” slovenliness has deep roots, dating back to British antipathy toward Spanish culture and Catholicism during the Enlightenment and the era of colonial expansion. The American understanding of the Spanish past is shaped by ideas of colonial Spain in the U.S. historical imagination. Richard Kagan coined the term “Prescott’s paradigm” to describe “the juxtaposition of Spanish decadence and American progress,” a perspective that dominated U.S. discourses of Spain throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/kagan-richard-l/">1996, 425</a>). William Hickling Prescott (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/prescott-william-hickling/">1837</a>, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/prescott-william-hickling-se/">1853</a>) and his nineteenth-century contemporaries advocated the “Black Legend,” based on details described by Spanish friar Bartolomé de las Casas in his <em>Brevísima relación de la destrucción de las Indias </em>([<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/de-las-casas-bartolome/">1552] 1994</a>), which was widely promoted by Dutch and English Protestant writers from the sixteenth century onward. The “Black Legend” cast the Spanish as exceptionally cruel and intolerant  in their interactions with Indigenous peoples in the New World. Spain was characterized as outside of the European Protestant mainstream in its interactions both within Europe and in the Americas.</p>
<p>Colonialism and Catholicism are inseparable, as Spanish Catholic missionaries did significant work among Indigenous peoples on assorted New World frontiers in ways that were at times more akin to slavery than to evangelization. As Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/canizares-esguerra-jorge/">2006</a>) has shown, Spanish, British, and Dutch colonial rule was similarly damaging to Indigenous populations and cultures, regardless of the religious background of the colo- nizer. However, the historical legacy of Catholic cruelty has had more rhetorical force in U.S. historical narratives.</p>
<p>Prescott’s  paradigm haunted U.S.  interaction with Mexico  during  their  mid-nineteenth-century war, when there was still widespread antagonism toward Catholics in the United States. Likewise, Prescott’s paradigm was reinforced by the Spanish-American War in 1898, after which the United States gained the last of Spain’s colonial territories. Despite efforts like Herbert Bolton’s (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/bolton-herbert-e/">1933</a>) to paint a “White Legend” of Spanish friars on the frontier civilizing Mexicans and Indians, rather than exterminating them, the historiographical habit of seeing Spain—and the fruit of its conquest, Mexico—in a villainous light persisted. This, of course, erased early American interactions of the British, Dutch, and French with Indigenous populations, which more often led to elimination or forced migration than integration. American exceptionalism was confirmed by U.S. interactions with Spain and Mexico. As destined as the United States was to prosper, Spain and Mexico were destined to fail. Mexico’s independence from Spain did nothing to free it from the Black Legend, and Mexico was cemented into a permanent past in reference to the United States. Catholicism, superstitious and secretive, was the foil to the religious ethos of the United States, which promoted individualism and progress, ordained by God through Protestantism.</p>
<p>Latina/o Catholic practice was often cast as idolatrous by Euro-American priests within the U.S. Catholic Church in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Mexicans in the United  States  faced  efforts to reform their expressions of the faith, including the worship of patron saints and the Virgin of Guadalupe. Through mission churches and at times served by Spanish priests, Mexicans were able to establish parishes in cities like Chicago, San Antonio, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. As Mexicans became more established in many areas, their Catholic faith served as a focal point in their communities, and often a refuge from their sometimes hostile surroundings. Mexicans and Puerto Ricans also faced Americanization campaigns in cities throughout the United States in the early twentieth century, which often included conversion to a Protestant denomination.</p>
<p>U.S. Catholic leaders saw ways to exploit the religious unrest in Mexico, caused by the Mexican Revolution, in rallying American Catholics to support missionaries in the U.S. Southwest and in newly acquired U.S. territories around the world (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/martinez-anne-m/">A. Martínez 2014</a>). Father Francis Kelley, president of the Catholic Church Extension Society, befriended Mexican bishops in exile in the United States and orchestrated a U.S. Catholic campaign to save the Mexican Catholic Church in the 1910s. This U.S. Catholic fervor was revived during the Cristero Rebellion (1926–1929), a Catholic uprising against an anticlerical government bent on limiting the role of the Catholic Church in Mexican society. Kelley used <em>Extension Magazine </em>to reach Catholics across the Northeast and Midwest and invoked the Spanish Catholic past in the Philippine Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Southwest to urge American Catholics to support mission work amongst “our Catholics.” Kelley exploited the fact that these were American territories, but sought to counter the classic Americanization projects that included Protestant evangelization. Kelley reminded American Catholics that these lands and peoples had already been civilized by the Spanish friars, and that it was the responsibility   of U.S. Catholics to sustain the faith among these peoples. This narrative of Catholic uplift also reinforced the notion that Mexicans and Puerto Ricans needed the help of Americans to sustain democracy, as expressed through religious liberty in this case.</p>
<p>During the <em>segundo mestizaje</em>, as Virgilio Elizondo (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/elizondo-virgilio/">1983</a>) calls the Mexican presence in the United States, the Virgin of  Guadalupe, in  particular, has  served as  a source of pride and strength—both national and religious—for generations of Mexican-descent men and women in the United States. Jeannette Rodríguez (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rodriguez-jeanette/">1994</a>) argues that Mexican American women experience <em>la virgen </em>as a role model for survival of the self, family, and community, and as a source of empowerment.  Since the 1970s, Chicana artists have also embraced the Virgin of Guadalupe as a source of empowerment. Yolanda M. López, for example, painted a series of three generations of Mexican women as <em>la virgen</em>, portraying them as strong, independent women. These extra-religious images were not always welcomed by traditionalists and the Catholic hierarchy. In 2001, Chicana artist Alma López created a digital image referencing <em>la virgen</em>, which provoked a significant backlash from conservative Catholics who saw the likeness of the Virgin of Guadalupe in a bikini made of roses as sacrilegious. Alicia Gaspar de Alba (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/gaspar-de-alba-alicia-and-alma-lopez-eds/">Gaspar de Alba and López 2011, 1–12</a>) documents the ways Latina artists envision the Virgin of Guadalupe as a national, cultural, and spiritual source of inspiration that is not dependent on the sanctioning of the Roman Catholic Church. This Chicana spirituality is a source of empowerment for Mexican American women who grew up with the presence of <em>la virgen</em>, but did not see the institutional church itself as supportive (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/sendejo-brenda/">Sendejo 2014</a>).</p>
<p>Religious sanctuary was a tool used as part of an interfaith movement to shelter Central American refugees in the 1980s, who were escaping civil wars in their home countries, largely driven by U.S. foreign policy. American Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish congregations provided food, shelter, jobs, and protection from law enforcement to Salvadoran and other Central American families who fled political persecution in their homelands. The assassinations of American Catholic nuns and Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero in El Salvador in 1980 by forces supported by U.S. foreign aid provoked those of many faiths, in addition to some progressive cities and universities, to attempt to counter American foreign policy. Sanctuary challenged this policy by offering humanitarian aid to those escaping U.S. government-sanctioned violence and repression. At the same time, however, the Catholic Church often supported repressive regimes in Latin American countries. Romero initially did so, but eventually came to embrace Liberation Theology, a Latin American theology of the poor. Pope Francis (Jorge Mario Bergoglio, elected pope in 2012) was scrutinized by Argentinians for his alleged role in defending the authoritarian regime against the poor during the dictatorship, accusations that have been largely discredited.</p>
<p>The twenty-first century has seen an increase in Latina/o evangelicals throughout Latin America, the Caribbean, and the United States. Among the 22 percent of U.S. Latinas/os who identify as Protestant, approximately three-quarters are part of evangelical denominations. Latinas/os between thirty and fifty years of age are leaving the Catholic Church for evangelical churches while younger Latinas/os (aged eighteen to twenty-nine), are becoming unaffiliated with religious institutions. This overall shift away from Catholicism has been occurring quite rapidly. As recently as <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/pew-research-center-se/">2010</a>, Pew research showed that 67 percent of Latinas/os identified as Catholic. Latina/o former Catholics have been drawn to charismatic movements within the United States, such as Victory Outreach and Vineyard, which have sought to appeal to Latina/o youth, in particular (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/sanchez-walsh-arlene/">Sánchez-Walsh 2003</a>). More traditional groups such as Mennonites and Mormons have also made special appeals to Latinas/os in the United States.</p>
<p>Some Catholic organizations have moved toward more charismatic and varied practices to attempt to attract Latinas/os. For example, the Valley Missionary Program in the Coachella Valley built a shrine with a pyramid topped by a statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe as part of its outreach to Latina/o immigrants, carving out  a  space within Catholic practice for Indigenous symbolism and the patroness of the Americas (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/groody-daniel-g/">Groody 2002, 88–89</a>).</p>
<p>As dramatically as the Latina/o Catholic landscape has been shifting, so has the Latina/o presence within the Catholic Church in the United States (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/matovina-timothy/">Matovina 2012</a>). As of 2013, Latinas/os made up  one-third of the U.S. Catholic population. While younger Latinas/ os are less likely to be Catholic, younger Catholics are more likely to be Latina/o. Since Latinas/os are a statistically young population, and are growing faster than the white population, their presence in the Catholic Church is likely to grow.</p>
<p>Mexico and the United States have both seen a revival of Indigenous religious expression. Historically, Indigenous religions resisted, coopted, and transformed Catholicism in Mexico. Many Indigenous faiths were believed to have died out but are being revived or becoming more openly practiced by Indigenous communities throughout Mexico. In some  cases, this revival is tied to efforts to promote the use of Indigenous languages. Among the Huichol, Mazatec, and other Indigenous groups, language, religion, and culture are not easily separable. In many cases, Catholicism has become part of this spiritual practice, along with rituals that predate the Spanish invasion (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/foudree-paja/">Foudree 2013</a>). In the United States, <em>calpulli </em>and <em>danzante </em>groups have embraced Indigenous Mexican dances and rituals in an effort to express resistance to the Spanish colonization of the sixteenth century and the American neocolonization from the mid-nineteenth century to the present.</p>
<p>Puerto Ricans are overwhelmingly Catholic, but their religious practice, like that of Mexicans, is often considered to be outside the Catholic mainstream (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/diaz-stevens-ana-maria/">Díaz-Stevens 1993</a>). Caribbean Catholic culture was shaped not only by Indigenous cultures, but also by the traditions of Africans who were brought to the islands as slaves. Cubans and Cuban Americans have a wider range of spiritual practice with a stronger presence of non-European religions, especially among non-elites. Santería (Way of Saints), or Regla de Ocha (Rule of Osha), has deep roots in Cuba, dating to the slave trade. This Yoruba-origin religion has incorporated elements of Catholicism into its New World practice. Miguel De La Torre (2003) documents Santería in the Cuban American population and its interaction with Catholic and other religions in the Miami area. Michelle A. González (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/gonzalez-michelle-a/">2006</a>) argues that regardless of race, Afro-Cuban culture is integral to Cuban culture and religion. Others have highlighted the role of Judaism among Cubans and Cuban Americans (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/behar-ruth-se/">Behar 2007</a>).</p>
<p>Latina/o religious expression and identification is as diverse as the Latina/o population itself. It draws on the distinct historical legacies of Latin American national origins, and their specific relations with, and arrival in, the United States. Though still predominantly Catholic, Latinas/os are becoming more religiously diverse in the twenty-first century.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Generally imagined as referring to who you are or what you do sexually, the word “sexuality” is used to name a wide range of social identifications predicated on sexual object choice, romantic desires, political identifications, social affinities, and/or erotic proclivities. Discursively linked to activities of procreation, reproduction, and social organization, sexuality also functions to name nonreproductive sensory pleasures and modes of erotic and amorous  expression  that  exceed  gender or genitals and are not reducible to sexual identities such as heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian, or gay. Formed through its relationship to other categories of social difference and forms of embodiments, Latinx sexuality is best understood by probing the ways it is mobilized, encountered, and sensed in the body and in the world. Rather than a precise codification of sexual practices, communities, or forms of erotic expression, the histories, politics, and scholarship that surround Latinx sexuality register the ongoing exchanges of power that instantiate and trigger multiple forms of social control. That the delights of corporeal exploration, fantasy, and sexual joy might  persist  despite  these  mechanisms of sexual regulation suggests the unruly ways desire disrupts and reroutes these disciplinary flows.</p>
<p>In dominant discourse, rather than being aligned with pleasure, Latinx sexuality has long been framed as pathological and a menace to Anglo civil society. Historicized accounts demonstrate how embodied understandings of Latinidad predicated on nationality, color, class, physical and cognitive norms, gender, age, immigration status, and other registers of difference impact understandings of Latinx bodies, desires, and sexual practices. In the late nineteenth century, racist nativist impulses fed directly into the burgeoning eugenics movements that swept through the United States and lasted well into the twentieth century, resulting in a range of efforts to control the sexuality and reproduction of newly conquered and colonized subjects. These racialized discourses that rendered Latinx bodies and sexualities as dirty, deviant, and diseased continued to be marshaled throughout the twentieth century and were forcefully activated during the Bracero Program that brought millions of male migrant workers, many of whom were Indigenous Mexicans, to the United States (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/loza-mireya/">Loza 2011</a></strong>). On the East Coast, early sociological accounts, such as Oscar Lewis’s <em>La Vida: A Puerto Rican Family in the Culture of Poverty—San Juan and New York </em>(<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/lewis-oscar-se-3/"><strong>1966b</strong></a>), specifically linked what Lewis termed “cultures of poverty” to aberrant forms of sexuality and gendered deviance. These immigrant waves had significant and lasting effects on both the perceived and the practiced sexual realities of migrant communities, disrupting kinship patterns and sexual practices, while also creating new sexual opportunities for those who no longer felt bound to the inherited sexual norms of their communities of origin.</p>
<p>The characterizations of Latinx culture as sexually deviant and dangerous that emerged as a result of immigration, forced annexation, and colonial occupation have remained central to depictions of Latinxs   within U.S. popular culture. While a select few light-skinned men ascended to the status of “Latin Lover” in early Hollywood, most were depicted as drunken brutes who sexually abused women, or as desexualized or feminized (and therefore abject) comic figures (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/berg-charles-ramirez/"><strong>Berg 2002</strong></a>). These associations transformed over time, ebbing and flowing in relation to labor demands and other social factors, while depictions of sexualized Latino masculinities continue to draw on images of the patriarchal macho, a racialized term used to script Latino men as abusive and sexually threatening. Latinas have been represented in a similarly stereotypical manner as either sinners or saints, emphasizing the implied cultural and sexual difference of Catholicism from Anglo-American Protestant norms. The result has been images of Latinas as virginal martyrs who are victims of the machismo of their culture; as “spitfires” who are wild, untamed, and exude uncontrolled sexuality; or as mothers whose excessive reproduction mark them as aberrant or manipulative agents intent on planting “anchor babies” in an effort to secure U.S. state resources. These characterizations are also racially coded, impacting those Latinxs who visually register as Indigenous or black in ways that align with the perverse particularities of those racial stereotypes. These sexualized associations have become foundational to Latinxs’ ethnic, racial, and gendered identities as (non) citizen subjects of the United States, marking Latinx sexuality as wholly excessive, yet always lacking.</p>
<p>Early scholarship in the fields of Chicano and Puerto Rican studies—academic initiatives that emerged as part of activist movements—responded to these sexualized characterizations with sanitized patriarchal images of the <em>familia </em>that supported heteronormative nationalist projects. Organized around a politics of “traditional” values and political unity, these representations of cultural nationalisms actively erased other historically and socially significant sexual  practices and forms of gendered expression from public view, or else portrayed them as manifestations of corrupt influences brought about through migration or association with Anglos (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rodriguez-richard-t/"><strong>R. T. Rodríguez 2009</strong></a>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/beltran-cristina/">C. Beltrán 2010</a></strong>). However, Latinas engaged within the various social movements of the 1970s and 1980s quickly pushed back against masculinist formulations of ethnic nationalism to forge more dynamic understandings of the cultural significance of sexuality. On the West Coast, Chicanas formed their own organizations such as Las Hijas de Cuauhtémoc and Las Adelitas de Aztlán, and on the East Coast, specific caucuses within the Young Lords were organized to address the impact of sexism on both men and women, eventually leading that group to speak out in early support of the gay liberation movement (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/beltran-cristina/">C. Beltrán 2010</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/blackwell-maylei/">Blackwell 2011</a></strong>).</p>
<p>During the 1970s and 1980s, Latinas also joined with other women of color to counter the Eurocentrism within U.S. feminist and gay and lesbian movements, and discussions of sexuality and sexual practices were often a central feature of these consciousness-raising efforts (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/blackwell-maylei/">Blackwell 2011</a></strong>). The ground-breaking anthology edited by Cherríe Moraga and Gloria Anzaldúa (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/moraga-cherrie-and-gloria-e/">1981</a>), <em>This </em><em>Bridge Called </em><em>My Back</em>, specifically addressed the cultural and political necessity of analyzing how race, gender, and sexuality were mutually constructed, and became a foundational text for an emerging women of color feminism. Many of the feminist and queer writers of that generation wrote of the pain of feeling ostracized by their families and cultural communities of origin for expressing a sexual identity that was not predicated on heterosexuality or traditionally defined gendered roles (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/moraga-cherrie-se/">Moraga 1983b</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/anzaldua-gloria-e/">Anzaldúa 1987</a></strong>). Latina lesbians were particularly active in forging spaces  that  considered the impact of sexuality and sexual identities, forming newsletters, editing anthologies, and creating local and international groups through the Encuentros de Lesbianas Feministas de América Latina y el Caribe (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/ramos-juanita-ed/">J. Ramos 1987</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/trujillo-carla/">Trujillo 1991</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/perez-emma/">Pérez 1998</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/de-la-tierra-tatiana/">de la tierra 2002</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rodriguez-juana-maria/">J. M. Rodríguez 2003</a></strong>). Within these circles, Latinas actively debated the cultural significance of sexual practices such as pornography, bisexuality, sex-work, sadomasochism, transgender identity,  and  gender roles such as butch and femme. At times, these discussions resulted in the exclusion or censorship of those who did not conform to imagined community standards of sexuality (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/hollibaugh-amber-and-cherrie-moraga/">Hollibaugh and Moraga 1983</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/de-la-tierra-tatiana/">de la tierra 2002</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rodriguez-juana-maria/">J. M. Rodríguez 2003</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rodriguez-juana-maria-se-2/">2014b</a></strong>). The advent of AIDS in the 1980s brought an urgency to activist efforts to respond to the crisis with explicit and culturally relevant discussions of sex (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rodriguez-juana-maria/"><strong>J.M. Rodríguez 2003</strong></a>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/roque-ramirez-horacio-n-se-2/">Roque Ramírez 2010</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/roque-ramirez-horacio-n-se-3/">2011</a></strong>). LGBT Latinx groups in California, Texas, New York, and elsewhere formed volunteer community organizations to meet the physical, psychic, and spiritual devastation that surrounds the AIDS pandemic, and some groups later succeeded in securing funds and increased legitimacy to continue those efforts. As new medical interventions have emerged—interventions that benefit only some—the funding and political energy surrounding community sexual health projects has dwindled even as new cases of AIDS continue to impact the most vulnerable members of the Latinx community: youth, transgender women, sex workers, and others impacted by poverty, racial discrimination, and social precarity.</p>
<p>While different constellations of queer Latinx community groups have dealt quite explicitly with the politics and passions surrounding sex and sexuality, these attempts to impact Latinx representation remain marginalized. In most Latinx-produced forms of cultural representation, particularly films intended for “cross-over” (that is, non-Latinx) audiences, depictions of idealized Latinx families have served as a way to counter mainstream associations of Latinx sexual deviance, even as they often promote sanitized images of self-sacrificing mothers and strict hardworking fathers. Efforts at cinematic representation generally ignore issues of domestic violence, socially authorized forms of male promiscuity and dominance, the cultural shaming of sexually active women, nonheterosexual practices and identities, and those who do not conform to  gendered norms. Independent films remain the most robust visual medium for depictions of transgender, queer, and nonheteronormative Latinx sexualities, with some notable films including <em>La Mission</em>, <em>Gun Hill Road</em>, <em>Mosquita y Mari</em>, <em>Tangerine</em>, and <em>Mala.</em></p>
<p>Given the centrality of sexuality to representations of Latinx populations within dominant society, and its pivotal role in the long history of political and social engagement within the activist and academic practices, it is no wonder that questions of sexuality have become  a central feature of Latinx studies. Latinx sexuality, specifically the cultural associations attached to our multiply-coded bodies, has been investigated through art (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/perez-laura-e/">L.

Gutiérrez 2010</a></strong>), and cultural criticism that cuts across these various genres (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/perez-emma/">E. Pérez 1998</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/quiroga-jose/">Quiroga 2000</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rodriguez-juana-maria/">J.

<p>Reflecting cultural and racial identities formed through colonialism, enslavement, state policies of incarceration and detention, and the day-to-day precarity of low-wage labor, racial hostility, and sexual violence and harassment, much of the discourse on Latinx sexuality, particularly female sexuality, has been tied to narratives of survival and resistance. These accounts often elide more complex questions of how sexual pleasure might endure or the multiple ways that sexual subjects might engage racialized abjection or sexual violence on  their own  terms. Despite  the seeming  abundance of critical work on Latinx sexuality, specific work that presents more explicit depictions of Latinx sexual pleasures and erotic practices remains less widely circulated, albeit with notable exceptions. Graphic accounts of Latinx sexuality include the literature of gay Chicano writer John Rechy (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rechy-john/">1963</a></strong>), an early chronicler of underground homosexual sexual culture in Los Angeles and elsewhere; Arnaldo Cruz-Malavé’s (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/cruz-malave-arnaldo/">2007</a></strong>) account of the tempestuous life of Juanito Xtravaganza, a Puerto Rican hustler in the 1970s; Jaime Cortez’s (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/cortez-jaime/">2004</a></strong>) bilingual graphic novel <em>Sexilio/Sexile </em>about the life of trans activist and former sex-worker Adela Vázquez; the many irreverent comics of openly bisexual Erika Lopez (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/lopez-erika/">1997</a></strong>); and the salaciously rich “as-told-to” autobiography of porn legend Vanessa del Rio (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/del-rio-vanessa/">2010</a></strong>). In the performance arena, Xandra Ibarra, who performs  under  the name La Chica Boom, draws on hypersexualized and racialized references in what she terms “<em>spic</em>tacles”; Elizabeth Marrero performs as drag king “Macha”; the queer collective Butchlalis de Panochtitlan explores butch intimacies; and April Flores, a self-identified “fat-girl,” has made a name for herself in queer and BBW (big, beautiful women) pornography. Increasingly some academics are becoming bolder in addressing topics such as online sexual practices, BDSM, bisexuality, pornography, sex-work, and other more socially charged articulations of Latinx sexuality (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/decena-carlos-ulises/">Decena 2011</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/ramos-ivan/">I. Ramos 2015</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/rodriguez-juana-maria-se-2/">J. M. Rodríguez 2014b</a></strong>; <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/vargas-deborah-r-se-2/">D. Vargas 2014</a></strong>;<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/gonzalez-lopez-gloria/"> González-López 2015</a></strong>).</p>
<p>While certain inroads have been made in portraying more diverse and nuanced forms of Latinx sexuality in the media, the arts, and the academy, the same cannot be said of the Latinx political arena, where monogamy, marriage, and romanticized versions of family continue to dominate discussions of immigration reform, reproductive rights, the criminal (in)justice system, and labor policies. Sexual realities such as bisexuality, polygamy, under-age sexual activity, multiple  families, and the multifaceted sex industry are rarely discussed  as relevant to Latinx politics, or, if so, are depicted as problems to be solved, not social actualities that need to be addressed. In response to representations within both mainstream Anglo and Latina/o political agendas that depict Latinx sexuality as dirty, Deborah Vargas has reappropriated the term <em>sucio </em>(dirty, dishonest, and impure), as a queer Latinx analytic “in relation to contemporary neoliberal projects that disappear the most vulnerable and disenfranchised by cleaning up spaces and populations deemed dirty and wasteful” (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/vargas-deborah-r-se-2/">2014, 715</a></strong>). This racialized sexualized excess that refuses to disappear at times operates locally under the names <em>chusma</em>, <em>chola</em>, or <em>chonga </em>as a means to censor and shame those who refuse to perform normative Anglo sexuality (<strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/works_cited/hernandez-jillian/">J. Hernandez 2009</a></strong>). This ongoing tension between attempts to sanitize Latinx sexuality by reducing it to the sphere of the private in the service of social acceptance and more radical and capacious manifestations that reject the politics of respectability, and the shame, censorship, and social stigmatization upon which it is based, remains at the heart of attempts to bring discussions of Latinx sexuality into greater view. While the discourses that surround sexuality can only be understood at the nexus between various historically situated forms of social discipline and articulations of individual and collective expression, the willful and wayward corporeal and psychic pleasures that sexuality also ignites, more often than not, elude the traps of linguistic capture to hover in the vapor of memory, feeling, and the sensorial.</p>
