				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been two years since we launched <em>Keywords for Latina/o Studies</em> (2017) and we are heartened by the wonderful response, positive reception, and wide adoption for courses by professors.   Our intent from the beginning was to create a shared dialogue and vocabulary, a site for critical thinking, and to contribute the ongoing project of Latina/o/x Studies. To our amazement this dialogue is happening, and we as the editors, would like to impart what we have learned with you.  In turn, we invite you to let us know how <em>Keywords </em>has assisted you with your teaching, research, and writing.  We welcome critiques and suggestions for improving <em>Keywords.</em>  For example, as we explained in <em>Keywords,</em> there are omissions of terms that we plan to include in future editions. As well, the term Latinx grew in prominence after we had completed the bulk of the project. We understand and agree that the term “x” is a critical turn in the ongoing political potential in the field of Latina/o/x Studies, and we believe that a project like <em>Keywords</em> encourages us to think about and discuss the importance and use of such terms.</p>
<p>As part of the NYU Press <em>Keywords</em> series, the book builds upon the tradition of providing a critical source for engaging and understanding a wide range of terms and concepts that circulate in a field of study. Here, the reader is guided through the corpus of scholarship and made aware of how keywords operate therein. The bibliographical citations point to further directions that interested readers can pursue.</p>
<p>The audience for this book is a broad one. The volume, naturally, operates as a useful resource for any college or graduate-level course in Latina/o/x, Ethnic, and American Studies. Major scholars in the field discuss how other scholars have organized around, implemented, discussed or otherwise utilized concepts and terms across space and time. This project asserts its utility in history, literature and social science courses. It is also useful for seasoned scholars to familiarize themselves with terms that circulate outside their field. It is both a general introduction and a critical resource for greater interrogation of scholarly terms.</p>
<p>At this website, we will provide resources for the use of this book in classrooms. This website will provide suggestions for students and teacher alike, who wish to find and explore creative ways to engage the entries. We want this to be a helpful resource for your classes—whether you are at either side of the lectern. For those outside of the classroom, this is also a resource. Learning, of course, has never been constricted to the walls of a school. We encourage readers to engage, return, make suggestions, and enjoy this project.</p>
<p>As co-editors, we are excited that our volume has been useful to so many readers. We encourage you to embrace a field that is complex, dynamic, and ever-changing; one that maps Latina/o/x experiences in the United States in a transnational, hemispheric framework. ¡Pa’lante!</p>
