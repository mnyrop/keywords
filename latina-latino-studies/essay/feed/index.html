				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The terms “Afro-Latina” and “Afro-Latino” refer to those Latinas/os in the United States who are of African ancestry and choose blackness as a racial identity in addition to identifying along ethnic lines with their Latina/o national origins. The terms are not exclusive to the United States, as activists of African descent in Latin America and the Caribbean have also begun to use them (Whitten and Torres 1998; Seelke 2008). As the Latina/o population has grown in the United States, so has the number of Latinas/os of African descent (López and  Gonzalez-Barrera  2016).  According  to  the 2010 U.S. census, the 50.4 million Latinas/os in the United States (the nation’s largest panethnic group) account for 16.3 percent of the country’s population. About 2.5 percent of those Latinas/os also identified themselves as “Black” on the 2010 census. That compares with close to 53 percent who said they were also “White” and  the 36.7 percent who described themselves as “some other race.” (The 2010 census permitted Latinas/os to select  a Hispanic/Latino” ethnic origin category in addition to selecting any number of the racial categories of black, white, Asian, or “some other race.”) Most Afro- Latinas/os in the United States can trace their origins  to Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Panama (among other Central American countries), and Puerto Rico, though over a quarter of a million people of Mexican heritage also defined themselves as “Black” in the 2010 census; many Mexicans are of African descent (Vinson  and  Restall  2009).  As  compared  to  other Latinas/os, Afro-Latinas/os are much less likely to be immigrants and are more likely to speak English in their homes.</p>
<p>Despite the small percentage of Latinas/os who of- ficially acknowledge their African ancestry on U.S. census forms, the academic study of their complex identities predates the origins of Latina/o studies as a field. Indeed, the Afro–Puerto Rican bibliophile Arturo Alfonso Schomburg added his collection of more than 5,000 books, 3,000 manuscripts, 2,000 etchings and paintings, and several thousand pamphlets concerning Afro-Latinas/os and other African diaspora descendants to the New York Public Library Division of Negro Literature, History and Prints back in 1926; this division was the forerunner to the presently named Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture (Sinnette 1989; Valdés 2017). Today, the Schomburg Center is one of the world’s leading research facilities devoted to the preservation of materials on the global African and African diaspora experiences.</p>
<p>Yet in spite of the richness of the existing material regarding the Afro-Latina/o experience (Jiménez Román and Flores 2010), this area of research is often overlooked in Latina/o studies. Silvio Torres-Saillant (2003) has noted that many Latina/o studies scholars have thus far been content to treat the racial mixture of Latinas/os as eviscerating any racial differences. In fact, Latina/o studies extends the Latin American studies concept of <em>mestizaje </em>(the notion that racial mixture in a population is emblematic of racial harmony and insulated from racial discord and inequality) into the belief that Latinas/ os in the United States are racially enlightened because of their racial mixture (Dzidzienyo and Oboler 2005). At the same time, Torres-Saillant (2003) has noted that many Latina/o scholars have been content to focus on <em>mestizaje</em>-pride without thoroughly interrogating its subtext of white supremacy.</p>
<p>Some examples of the <em>mestizaje</em>-pride element surface in the work of Victor Valle and Rodolfo D. Torres (1995), along with the more famous example of Gloria Anzaldúa (1987). Anzaldúa is so enamored of <em>mestizaje  </em>as a concept that she goes so far as to refer favorably to Mexican philosopher José Vasconcelos’s (1925) “cosmic race” theory of Latin American racial superiority through racial mixing, without mentioning the strong white supremacist aspects of his theory. According to Vasconcelos, the benefits of the cosmic race mixture occur as “the lower types of the species will be absorbed  by the superior. In this manner, for example, the blacks could be redeemed, and step by step, by voluntary extinction, the uglier stocks will give way to the more handsome” (1997 [1925], 32). Anzaldúa’s endorsement characterizes the cosmic race theory as being “opposite to the theory of the pure Aryan, and to the policy of racial purity that white American practices”; she adds that “his theory is one of inclusivity” (1987, 77). Despite the fundamental racism of Vasconcelos’s theory, Anzaldúa goes on to posit that a Latina/o “mestiza consciousness” breaks down paradigms and is thus more progressive about race relations and thereby allows mestizas (read “Chicanas”) to act as mediators linking different groups of people together. This fascination with a benevolent <em>mestizaje </em>is  also echoed by  Victor Valle  and   Rodolfo D. Torres when they characterize it as an “outlaw discourse” which is “radically inclusive” and a “response to Western imperialism” (1995, 148–49). Unfortunately, Latina/o celebrations of <em>mestizaje </em>leave little room for acknowledging the particularities of more pronounced African ancestry in facial appearance, skin shade, or hair texture.</p>
<p>As Afro-Cuban author Evelio Grillo has noted in his memoir about growing up in Tampa, Florida, in the 1920s and 1930s,  Afro-Latinas/os  are  often “too  black to be Hispanic” (2000, xiii). This coincides with Piri Thomas’s (1967) experiences as described in his memoir of growing up in New York City in the 1930s and 1940s, as well as with observations of the contemporary Afro- Latina/o context (Bonilla-Silva 2010). Latina/o studies as a discipline has traditionally reflected this invisibility of Afro-Latina/o identity (Hernández 2003).</p>
<p>What is most disturbing about the dearth of Afro- Latina/o research in Latina/o studies is the way in which it obscures the complexity of the socioeconomic racial hierarchy that exists across Latina/o communities. Indeed, Afro-Latinas/os in the United States consistently report receiving racist treatment at the hands of other Latinas/os in addition to being perceived as outsiders  to the construction of Latina/o identity. For example, Afro-Latinas/os are frequently mistaken for African Americans in their own communities and upon identifying themselves as Afro-Latinas/os are told, “But you don’t look Latina!” (Comas-Díaz 1996, 168). Indeed the <em>2002 National Survey of Latinos </em>sponsored by the Pew Hispanic Center and the Kaiser Family Foundation in- dicated that Latinas/os with more pronounced African ancestry, such as many Dominicans, more readily identify color discrimination as an explanation for the bias they experience from other Latinas/os (Pew Research Center 2002). Moreover, the <em>2010 National Survey of Latinos </em>found that after immigrant status, skin color discrimination is the most prevalent perceived form of discrimination for Latinas/os (Pew Research Center 2013). In turn such experiences of bias within the U.S. culture of racial consciousness motivate Latinas/os of African descent to begin self-identifying as Afro-Latinas/os.</p>
<p>In addition, studies suggest that the socioeconomic status of Afro-Latinas/os in the United States is  more akin to that of African Americans than to other Latinas/ os or white Americans. According to <em>How Race Counts for Hispanic Americans </em>(Logan 2003), a study by the State University of New York at Albany released in July 2003, Latinas/os who define themselves as “black” have lower incomes, higher unemployment rates, higher rates of poverty, less education, and fewer opportunities and are more likely to reside in segregated neighborhoods than those who identify themselves as “white” or “other.” Based on such data, the study concluded that there are stark differences between the standard of living for Afro- Latinas/os and that of all other Latinas/os in the United States. For this reason, the U.S. Census Bureau’s suggestion for modifying the census demographic questions so as to remove the Hispanic/Latino option as an ethnic choice and instead have it presented as a racial category distinct from black and all others has been viewed with alarm by Afro-Latina/o activists (Reyes 2014). Collapsing Latina/o and Hispanic ethnic identity into the list of racial categories risks obscuring the number of Afro- Latinas/os and rendering invisible the socioeconomic status differences of Latino/as across race that exist.</p>
<p>The disparities in living standards among Latinas/os of different races may thus also account for the increased willingness to identify as  Afro-Latina/o  in the United States (Darity Jr., Hamilton, and Dietrich 2010). Furthermore the segregated residential patterns of Afro-Latinas/os in areas of African American settlement provide Afro-Latina/o  youth  with  an  exposure to African American culture and racial consciousness that also influences their choice to identify as Afro- Latinas/os (Golash-Boza and Darity Jr. 2008). Indeed, one  study  of  Afro-Dominicans  found  that the longer Afro-Dominicans resided in the United States, the more likely they were to identify with African Americans (Bailey 2001). These are all issues that warrant much closer examination in the field of Latina/o studies.</p>
<p>There are notable exceptions to the disregard for Afro-Latina/o subjects in Latina/o studies. Latina/o scholars Miriam Jiménez Román and Juan Flores made  a significant contribution to the field when they published <em>The Afro-Latin@ Reader: History and Culture in the United States </em>in 2010. The anthology is a rich compilation of texts regarding Afro-Latina/o identity, history, culture and politics.</p>
<p>In addition to making a significant contribution to Latina/o studies, the burgeoning work on Afro-Latinas/ os also enriches other related field such as Black studies and African diaspora studies. Frank Guridy’s (2010) work examining the cross-national relationships between Afro-Cubans and African-Americans is a prime example of the production of knowledge in this area, along with Antonio López’s (2012) distillation of a century-long archive of Afro-Cuban / African American experiences in the United States. Nancy Raquel Mirabal (2017) has focused on Afro-Cubans in New York City in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In addition, the intersectional positions of Afro-Latina women (Jorge 1979; Comas-Diaz 1996; Vega, Alba, and Modestin 2012) and Afro-Latino gays and Afro-Latina lesbians (Lara 2010; Johnson and Rivera-Servera 2016) are also beginning to be researched. It is to be hoped that with the growth of knowledge of Afro-Latinas/os, the discipline of Latina/o studies will continue to expand and move beyond representations of Latinas/os as racially homogenous.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine carrying a gargantuan landmass, capped by glaciers, across your shoulders, the way people pose with reptiles at Coney Island. “Americas” is an impossible wonder to take on. This heavy expanse of a sign has the tendency to weigh down even the most ebullient. It means nothing and everything. America is named and narrated after the Florentine navigator Amerigo Vespucci—a figure whose unverifiable itineraries continue to stump historians across the centuries (Lush, date unknown; Arciniegas 2002; de las Casas 2010). Although he was not the first to encounter all that lay west of Europe, nor are his voyages fully substantiated or substantiatable, the ancient continents were made his attribute by the German cartographer Martin Waldseemuller, who imposed it on his 1507 in utero rendering of the world, the <em>Universalis Cosmographia </em>(Hébert 2003). The naming, a grandest of prizes given to this grandest instance of fronting, carries in it a mystifying credit, a grotesque trophy, a cartographer’s stamp. Americas has tried hard to shorthand and eradicate vast and dynamic Indigenous conceptions of space and time. As a catch-all, it supports a lazy and willful forgetting of Tawantinsuyu (Quechua for the four regions of the Inca Empire) and Anáhuac (Nahuatl for the Aztec’s “country by the waters”). Why these names don’t roll off all our tongues suggests all the unfamiliar and unrelenting consonants roiling under our collective surface. This imposition of the Old World and all its diseased baggage atop the New, the actual and discursive annihilation of what and who was here before, is just one method in the genocidal repertoire enabled by what Walter Mignolo calls the “two entangled concepts” of “modernity and coloniality” (Mignolo 2005, 2011; Quijano 2007). Americas is a utility for the making-vague and making-available of history and all its submerged players so that the New World can be easily wedged into the Old World’s narrative of progress, within which we’ll include area studies. In other fields that hold up the North American academy, “The Americas” is what the field of English, and English discipline, will do just about anything to repress, or make a special issue of, even and especially when it allows for “American Literature” (Saldívar 1991; Brady 2002; Gruesz 2002).</p>
<p>And yet, Americas is one of the dozens, if not hundreds of New World signs (like the “New World”) that require an “and yet” after an acknowledgment of its ferocious development and usages. The “and yet” turns up voluminous, insurgent actions that have long been prepared for any annihilating project. It is a creative holding place for that which takes in and moves in the words of Sylvia Wynter (1995, 7), “beyond the premises of both celebrants and the dissidents.” And yet, although the term’s ambiguity has facilitated violence, its very ambiguity can and has made possible the wondrous availability of Americas for other means. It is warranted and needed when there is a clear line between the us and the them (Martí 2002; Montero 2004). It can be a baroque altar for study that insists on all the racial, ethnic, gendered, and classed histories that have been lived, danced, and sounded across national paradigms; a way of retaining the complications and unpredictable effects of the “coloniality of modernity” without leaving anyone or anything out. There are as many senses of Americas as there are Americans. There is no way to take singular possession of it, even if that is the shared and singular aim of many. Americas suggests all parts north, central, south, and the archipelagos that spindle out from its four corners. It is an ongoing, collective process that reveals just how the New World formed and forms the Old—present even in posthumous rebellion by the artist Felix Gonzalez-Torres and his participatory “America” pavilion—whose generous minimalist experiments in world-making shook up the 2007 Venice Biennale (Spector et al. 2007). Evoked in whatever language or paralanguage, Americas can hold a mangrove tangle of Afro/Hispano/Luso/Franco/ Indo/Sino/Creole phonics and accompaniments. To use “Americas” or “Américas” might not matter as it can’t ever be fixed or made into a satisfactory pronoun with orthographic correctives. Regardless of whether one wants the word to represent and make legible its internal differences (or not), there is still the fact of all the unfamiliar and unrelenting accents roiling above our collective surface. Americas rustles the singular and plural at once.</p>
<p>And yet, how to take all this in? And just as hard, how can we ever hope to notate all that Americas retains and refrains? Herein lies the possible transformative power of approaching and reproaching the keyword. “Dance to the hurt!” as Earl Lovelace (1998, 14) once wrote. Americas requires the setting up of ghetto blasters on every corner of every sentence. All that makes it and is made up by it in music expands the repertoire of theory and theorists we associate with the Americas in Latina/o studies. Music allows for us to pick up the ends of the hemisphere’s vertical lines and work them into a helix, double-dutch style, where all, but especially girls, have made beautiful movements. Hear a most palpable instance in Rita Moreno’s version of “América,” after and through Chita Rivera, in that standard penned by Bernstein and Sondheim for <em>West </em><em>Side Story</em>. This song, an overheard castaway that deserves and requires further listening, is mistakenly shrugged off—via its women’s chorus—as assimilatory fodder. In Moreno’s telling, after Rivera, there is a palpable aesthetics developed by immigrant women who make do and find ways to  <em>stay </em><em>alive </em>despite all that works against them. They set us up, to sample the great phrase by Frances R. Aparicio, for “listening to the listeners” (Aparicio 1998). This song is performative anticipation of and feminist trouble for <em>El Plan de Santa Bárbara </em>calcified by the brown masculinist generation to follow (Chicano Coordinating Council 1969). Several decades later, this “América” is made the primary sample and activist grounds for an anthem that marked the conquest’s quincentenary: Los Fabulosos Cadillacs’ 1992 “Quinto Centenario” (<em>Play </em>it!). Their version of this brutal anniversary occupies the Broadway standard version of “América” so that we may listen to the volatile marrow established by some of its past performers. The song leans on this primary songtext as a rumbic invocation, uses it as a suitcase to carry the ska bomba that jumps out of it several bars later. And when the song shows most of its cards, one will need to jump up and down, hard. The anthem reveals how Americas can’t help its myriad punk anti-assimilationisms.</p>
<p>Americas is a sound system: its components, tangled wiring, and conch shells conspire to make immersion the only way in. “Do It Properly,” instructs the house super group 2 Puerto Ricans, a Blackman, and a Dominican— just a few of the company members who turn our ears to the inter-American grounds that are always in search of a vocal. To tend to and aerate these grounds, Americas demands that its scholars (whether musician, balloon seller, professor, nurse) be ready for anything; to do Americas properly means always keeping the dance circle flexible enough for all and any kinds of exits and entries. It insists that we change direction, if not give up on the idea of direction once and for all, as Louise Bennett’s (2008) “Colonisation in Reverse” has for so long taught us. Americas might denote a particular geography, but it is also the kind of ante-cartographic object, curricular and aesthetic and alive, that gets us toward a more expansive sense of place and time and people.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Latina/o art is the shaping, iterating, and/or interrogating of the cultural expressions of one’s relationship—even if contested—to <em>latinidad</em>. This definition speaks to the concerns of artists who may choose to directly or indirectly address <em>latinidad</em>, as well as to the reception and interpretation of the work of Latina/o artists. When art is used with a qualifier such as the point of origin or gender of an artist, questions arise about whether such a designation implies a uniform or identifiable aesthetic outcome. Just as “Latina/o” and “Latin American” are heavily contested terms, so too is “Latina/o art” in that it can be used as an umbrella term to encompass diverse artistic practices from geometric abstraction to activist driven social practice art.</p>
<p>Adriana Zavala (2015) has addressed the shortcomings of the term “Latin@ art,” in particular in its emphasis on immigrant cultures and the ways it does not account for particular histories like the Hispano experience in the Southwest, as well as its  elision  of  class and race differences. Zavala ultimately argues for the importance of Latina/o art as a category worth defining, studying, and supporting so as not to further marginalize the practices of artists who have been relegated to the periphery of attention in American and Latin American art historical accounts.</p>
<p>As a term, “Latina/o” should be considered fluid and similar to the constructed identities of American and Latin American. Latina/o artworks range from the didactic  to  the diffuse,  with some  employing the use of clear and succinct iconography to celebrate a cultural knowledge, and others questioning the very framework of nationality, belonging, and authenticity. Guillermo Gómez-Peña (1986) once described as proto-postmodern the hybrid tactics and syncretic aesthetics of Chicano and Latino art. Latina/o art has often been site driven by and critical of institutions, long before site-specific installation art or institutional critique. Muralism has been considered a didactic project bound to the walls, but it has a performative dimension that feminist artists such as Judith Baca and the artist group Asco have elaborated (Cockcroft and Barnet-Sánchez 1993; Latorre 2008; Chavoya and Gonzalez 2011). A deconstruction of language and a problematizing of the role of translation have been key thematics of Latina/o art, as demonstrated by the work of Celia Alvarez Muñoz, Freddy Rodríguez, Coco Fusco, and Ester Hernandez, to name a few.</p>
<p>The term “Latina/o art,” like “Latin American art,” is increasingly being considered necessary for diversifying the production and critical reception of art histories. Practically speaking, “Latina/o art” can be used to define, in E. Carmen Ramos’s (2014) broad term, “a field of production” by Chicanas/os, Puerto Ricans, Cuban Americans, or those of Caribbean or Latin American descent. This “field of production,” and the critical apparatus that is being defined by a multidisciplinary group of scholars and curators, emerged out of multiculturalism and the slow but important growth in numbers of Latinas/os in the arts.</p>
<p>While the institutional framing of Latina/o art within art history is important, it is essential to acknowledge the key role of this designation as always having been shaped by distinct communities and audiences. Amalia Mesa-Bains (1989) has called for a criticism that is attentive to the concept of nutrient sources. Mesa-Bains uses the term “nutrient” to describe how culture feeds “sensibility” and “intention.” As a scholar and artist, Mesa-Bains describes an intertextual approach to Latina/o art practices, which acknowledges the specificities of place and circumstance. Art historian Jennifer A. González has modeled what she describes as a “historical and dialogic” methodology aligned with this ethos (2008, 17).</p>
<p>The critical task of contextualizing Latina/o art involves not only an intertextual approach but one that acknowledges and promotes a broader history of art spaces and spaces of reception. As a field of study, Latina/o art and cultural history is a recent response born out of civil rights activism, interdisciplinarity, and the  growth  of  institutional  support  structures.  There is a shared sense of belatedness that the category of Latina/o art shares with Latin American art but also with American art. Just as the field of American art had to fight the tendency of equivalencies (American artists are just as good as European), so too do Latin American and Latina/o artists bear the burden of proving themselves worthy of being considered for integration into the canon.</p>
<p>As has been said before in a variety of contexts, the histories of Latina/o art have yet to be fully documented. This focus on documentation of Latina/o art derives from systemic and structural erasures that exclude its importance to the overarching history of art in the United States. Interdisciplinarity has been key to collection, documentation, and assessment as the formation of a critical discourse on Latina/o art has come chiefly from fields outside of art history, in particular literature, ethnic studies, and anthropology (Bishop 2006; Artistic Research 2011).</p>
<p>Whether Latina/o art is always understood as politically engaged depends upon the artist’s practice and critical framing of the work. However, there are shared historical conditions, as well as common    experiences of erasure and exclusion from the cultural mainstream, that must be considered. Latina/o civil rights movements have shared aesthetic, community-based strategies, with strong print cultures connecting struggles  of Puerto Ricans and Chicanas/os, for example. At the same time, U.S.-based Latina/o artists have responded to government interventions in Central America. In this sense, Latina/o art is a strategic means to identify affinities, whether those are shared historical legacies or similar political and aesthetic modalities.</p>
<p>In <em>Resisting Categories: Latin American and/or Latino?</em>, Héctor Olea, Mari Carmen Ramírez, and Tomás Ybarra- Frausto, scholars and architects of a major art historical documentation project on Latina/o and  Latin  American art, describe Latina/o and Latin American art as an “intellectual field,” focusing on how grassroots, activist, and academic print cultures have been key in “defining” and “defying” these terms (2012, 40–49). They also subscribe to a majority opinion in the field of art history, which has taken Latin American and Latina/o art to be an “operative concept” or “construct”—that is to  say, one that is problematic yet necessary to make an argu- ment for the inclusion, qualification, and appreciation of this art.</p>
<p>The critical reception of Latina/o art has also of late been defined by a certain refusal on behalf of mainstream art critics to acknowledge the need for identity-based frameworks, with the argument being that grouping artists together according to cultural affiliation is no longer necessary or desirable. Ironically, this has been an argument that has also been fostered by Latina/o artists who want their work to be judged on aesthetic merits or demand that their work be shown within a variety of art historical considerations. Exhibitions such as El Museo’s Bienal <em>The S Files </em>(Museo del Barrio, New York, 2000–ongoing), <em>Phantom Sightings: Art After the Chicano Movement </em>(LACMA 2008), and <em>The Question Is Known: </em><em>(W)here Is Latin American/Latino Art </em>(Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts, San Francisco, 2008) used a variety of curatorial frameworks to present Latina/o  art forms as a multitude of conceptual and formal approaches, at times at odds with each other (Gonzalez, Fox, and Noriega 2008).</p>
<p>Criticism and reflections on Latina/o art have to negotiate a dual (or even multiple) reality of transna- tional identity while still understanding how the local or regional inform the works of many artists. There have been numerous critiques of the overemphasis on Latina/o artists and movements in California, New York, Texas, and Florida, leaving under-acknowledged the role of Latinas/os in the Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and even the South (Herrera 2008).</p>
<p>Art is by and large a creative expression, but the arbiters of meaning and value oftentimes delineate what is deemed to be art. When art is formally codified, or recognized and identified, as such, in general, deter- mining factors are “funding sources, public exhibitions, art collection, and critical discourse” (Noriega 1999, 187). While  both  Latina/o  and  Latin  American artists as well as those who investigate their work have fought for inclusion and representation, the outcome for each field has differed dramatically. There are concerns and struggles in both the Latin American and Latina/o art historical fields that overlap, as reflected in the title for the aforementioned ICAA’s critical anthology <em>Resisting Categories: Latin American and/or Latino?</em>, but there are also differences in vantage point. Structures of validation and legitimization will function differently be- cause, as Tomás Ybarra-Frausto (2013) articulates, “Latino Arts have been mainly created and disseminated apart from official cultural patronage and institutions.” This points to an apparent paradox concerning the presence of Latina/o artists, especially those whose practices are not easily integrated into the mainstream.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Assimilation has long functioned as the <em>telos </em>in narratives about the American experience and as an organizing rubric in U.S. immigration history, the social sciences, particularly sociology, and public policy (Alba and Nee 2007). Immigrants and their U.S.-born descendants are expected to blend into and to find acceptance, if not success, in the mainstream. Indeed, assimilation is often linked to the American dream. Those who do not assimilate or who are deemed inassimilable are generally regarded and treated as outsiders or failed citizens.</p>
<p>Assimilation is the process whereby the boundary between mainstream and margin blurs, disappears, or paradoxically, is reinforced. While the term is commonly used in the United States in relation to immigrants, it may also be applied to any group not deemed part of the mainstream, such as religious, linguistic, and sexual minorities, and to the production, circulation, and consumption of cultural practices and products (for example, Mexican food, such as burritos and guacamole). In this latter sense, “to assimilate” is synonymous with “to mainstream” or “to cross over.” In many instances of assimilation, formerly distinguishable groups, practices, or products eradicate, blend into, or transform one another, becoming more similar in the process. However, in others, the dominant group absorbs a minority or minoritized group as its distinct, constitutive, and subordinate other.</p>
<p>The paradoxical process by which a person or group assimilates or  is  assimilated as  an  outsider is  known as differential inclusion (De Genova, Mezzadra, and Pickles 2015). Examples of differential inclusion can be found in the U.S. Supreme Court cases of <em>Cherokee Nation v. Georgia </em>(1831), <em>Dred Scott v. Sandford </em>(1857), and <em>Downes v. Bidwell </em>(1901), which respectively saw the incorporation of the Cherokee as “wards” of a “guardian” state (<em>Cherokee Nation v. Georgia 30 U. S. 2</em>), African Americans as members of “a subordinate and inferior class of  beings” (<em>Dred Scott v.  Sandford 60  U.  S. 404–</em><em>405) </em>and the island of Puerto Rico as “foreign . . . in a domestic sense” (<em>Downes v. Bidwell </em>182 U. S. 341). The figure of the model minority also exemplifies differential inclusion. Lisa Sun-Hee Park argues that the model minority does not enjoy “full citizenship rights . . . but rather, a secondary set of rights reserved for particular minorities who ‘behave’ appropriately and stay in their designated subsidiary space without complaint” (2015, 17). In his memoir, <em>Hunger </em><em>of Memory </em>(1982), Richard Rodriguez, the son of Spanish-speaking Mexican immigrants, rails against bilingual education, affirmative action, and identity politics in a plea for assimilation and colorblindness. Yet this former Berkeley  PhD  student and expert in British Renaissance literature enters the mainstream not as a bona fide American writer, but as  a model minority and, paradoxically, a “representative ‘Hispanic’ subject” (Schmidt Camacho 2008, 206).</p>
<p>The sociologist Robert E. Park and his colleagues at the University of Chicago have been credited with theorizing the concept of assimilation in the early twentieth century. While the Chicago School’s influence on American social sciences is apparent, the concept predates its members’ publications and is implicit in earlier practices, policies, institutions, and narratives, such as proposals to deport putatively unassimilable African Americans in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and efforts to “civilize” Native Americans in the nineteenth and twentieth. In the early twenty-first century,  “assimilation,” “acculturation,” “incorporation,” and “integration” are often used interchangeably. However, a number of scholars are careful to distinguish those terms from one another. For example,  acculturation (the minority’s adoption of the dominant language, dress, diet, habitus, and so on), incorporation (for example, through naturalization), and integration (the opposite of exclusion or segregation) may be stages in the assimilation process and are not necessarily  the same as assimilation in and of itself.</p>
<p>During the first half of the twentieth century, “assimilation” in the United States was synonymous with “Americanization” and “Anglo-conformity,” terms that signaled the dissolution of the immigrant’s  or  minority group’s culture within and by an Anglo-Protestant mainstream. With the civil rights and Black Power movements and surge in ethnic revivalism among Americans of all stripes, the imperative to assimilate into a dominant Anglo-Protestant culture appeared to wane in the last decades of the twentieth century. Scholars questioned what had come to be known as the “assimilation model” (Morawska 1994) and proffered instead the “bumpy line” (Gans 1992) theory of assimilation, foregrounding the retention of the immigrant group’s native language and  customs  in  the  host  society.  In “Is Assimilation Dead?,” the sociologist Nathan Glazer (1993) declared assimilation a failure, not only because the ideologies of pluralism and multiculturalism had eclipsed it, he argued, but because African Americans remained socially and economically marginalized.</p>
<p>The title of Glazer’s article notwithstanding, Americans never abandoned the concept of assimilation altogether. Since the 1940s, the ideologies of pluralism and multiculturalism have allowed many to assimilate into the mainstream as so-called ethnic or hyphenated Americans (Roediger 2005; Jacobson 2008). As scholars in  critical whiteness studies have  demonstrated,  one way “provisional whites,” like the Irish in the nineteenth century and Italians in the twentieth, became bona fide Americans was by actively distancing them- selves from blacks and other groups branded “colored,” such as the Chinese and Mexicans (Hochschild 1995; Jacobson 1998; Roediger 1999).</p>
<p>Assertions that a group is unable or unwilling to assimilate bring into relief assimilation’s relationship to citizenship and race. For example, some Americans opposed extending citizenship to Mexicans domiciled in the Mexican Cession and to Puerto Ricans because they considered those groups physically, culturally, and morally unfit for the responsibilities of U.S. democracy during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In short, they considered Mexicans and Puerto Ricans non-white. As a number of laws—from the 1790 Naturalization Act on—stressed, U.S. citizenship was sup- posed to be the purview and property of whites. Ultimately, Article VIII of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the 1848 treaty that ended the Mexican American War, made Mexicans eligible for U.S. citizenship, while the Jones Act of 1917 conferred U.S. citizenship on Puerto Ricans. The extension of citizenship to these groups rendered them whites, if only in name and not in practice. It also prompted a generation of Latina/o activists to fight for full citizenship by claiming whiteness during the first half of the twentieth century (Foley 1997; Guglielmo 2006; Haney López 2006).</p>
<p>Despite their nominal whiteness, Latinas/os have long been seen and treated as foreigners in the United States. For example, many Mexican Americans were derided as “greasers” or “beaners” by white Americans and as <em>pochos </em>by Mexicans throughout the twentieth century. <em>Pocho </em>originally meant faded, overripe, or expired, but in Mexican Spanish, it came to refer to an Americanized Mexican or Mexican American. Historically, it has been  pejorative.  Rather  than  highlight biculturalism, cultural hybridity, or transculturation—the last a term coined by the Cuban anthropologist Fernando Ortiz (1995) to signify the merging and converging of cultures—the label has been associated with alienation and cultural and linguistic loss and degradation on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. However, in the last decades of the twentieth century, Latina/o cultural workers began to ascribe new, affirmative meaning to <em>pocho</em>, just as an earlier generation had reclaimed the erstwhile invective <em>Chicano</em>.</p>
<p>In the early twenty-first century, doubts about Latina/o immigrants’ ability to be good Americans have resurfaced, with some immigration restrictionists insisting that those who enter or remain in the United States without authorization are undeserving of regularization (whether it be through permanent residency or naturalization) and that the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants, so-called anchor babies, should not be eligible for birthright citizenship as provided by the Fourteenth Amendment. Because they have long been associated with undocumented migration and temporary labor and because of the proximity of their homeland to the United States, Mexicans are deemed especially unassimilable. They are also seen as a threat to Anglo-Protestant culture and institutions, with some cultural commentators lamenting the “browning”  of the United States and warning about a <em>reconquista </em>of the lands once held by Mexico (Hanson 2003; Huntington 2004b). The political scientist Adrián Félix (2008) has labeled Mexicans’ perceived inability and/or unwillingness to assimilate “Mexican exceptionalism.”</p>
<p>Concepts like differential inclusion and Mexican exceptionalism signal that assimilation in the United States can be a partial and contradictory process. Social actors are frequently assimilated in or by one social arena, but excluded from or by another. For instance, undocumented workers are, by and large,   well integrated in the U.S. economy in the early twenty- first century. At the same time, those workers are not formally assimilated by the state. In many cases, they are actively excluded and persecuted by the state. Often, undocumented workers’ inclusion in the market depends on and derives from their exclusion in other social arenas.</p>
<p>Similarly, some undocumented individuals, especially those who arrived in the United States at a young age, have acculturated. They speak English without a foreign accent, generally do not wear distinctive signs of foreignness, such as turbans or <em>huipiles</em>, and participate in mainstream society—for example, as students or soldiers. Many of these immigrants call themselves and are called “undocumented Americans” and/or “DREAMers,” a reference to the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, which was first introduced in 2001 in the United States legislature but has not been passed (Vargas 2013). Especially if they grew up in the United States unaware of their undocumented status, many pass as Americans and feel American, signaling the performative and affective aspects of assimilation. Yet as “illegal aliens,” they are marginalized, particularly in the market, and are vulnerable to exploitation and deportation.</p>
<p>Where DREAMers have been upheld as valuable and vital members of American society who lack formal citizenship, the alien citizen is a U.S. citizen by virtue of her/his birth in that country, but is presumed to be and is treated as foreign (Ngai 2004). The concept of alien citizenship points to the simultaneity of formal membership in the polity and de facto or de jure marginalization or exclusion. The historian Mae M. Ngai maintains that Mexican Americans’ association with temporary labor in the United States—a tradition going back to the Bracero Program—has rendered them alien citizens.</p>
<p>The figures  of   the  undocumented  American, DREAMer,  alien  citizen,  and  bracero  expose   the discrepancy between economic and social integration and membership in the polity, between citizenship as process or practice (what some scholars call “cultural citizenship”) and citizenship as legal status (Rosaldo 1994; Coll 2010; Glenn 2011). Moreover, they point to intersectionality (the nexus of social identities, categories, and relationships, such as race, class, gender, and sexuality) and show that inclusion at one level of society can reinforce and even be predicated on marginalization in or exclusion at another.</p>
<p>Like differential inclusion, the concepts of segmented assimilation and racial naturalization draw attention to assimilation as a vexed process. Segmented assimilation, as theorized by the sociologists Alejandro Portes and Min Zhou (1993), posits that individuals and groups assimilate into a particular segment of society, not necessarily the mainstream. While some individuals and groups have assimilated and continue to assimilate into the white mainstream in the United States, others are barred from it due to differences that are perceived as insurmountable. These individuals and groups may be incorporated into other segments of the population, such as “ethnic niches” and “enclaves” or racial minority groups (Kasinitz, Battle, and Miyares 2001). For example, black immigrants from Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America and their descendants may assimilate and be assimilated as African Americans, a process the critical race scholar Devon W. Carbado (2005) terms “racial naturalization.” His concept highlights the ways in which some groups are violently included in the United States via racial subordination and exclusion from the white mainstream.</p>
<p>“Assimilation” is an important term in Latina/o studies, but not so much because it should function as a lens for narrating and interpreting Latina/o history or the so-called Latina/o experience. Nor should assimilation be dismissed as a force to be resisted so that a beleaguered, static, or enduring cultural identity can be uncovered and rescued. Rather, assimilation merits critical attention because of the ways in which it points to differential inclusion, segmented assimilation, and racial naturalization—in short, inclusion in a tiered society rife with inequalities. Assimilation illuminates belonging just as much as it sheds lights on marginalization and exclusion. Finally, assimilation allows us to understand the dynamism of culture and society and the complex relationship between social structures and social agents. Assimilation is often a two-way process, albeit an uneven one (Zolberg and Woon 1999). Latinas/os will continue to transform the United States just as the United States continues to transform Latinas/os.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At its most basic level, “barrio” refers to a place—a neighborhood, community, enclave, and/or region— that is familiar to many and evokes a range of affective responses. Unlike the term <em>colonia</em>, which  conjures ideas of semi-rural spatial formations, barrios are often imagined as decidedly urban spaces—as dense enclaves, which are familiar features of American cities (Sánchez Korrol 1994; D. Diaz 2005; Vigil 2008; Ward 2010). They are places born out of histories of segregation, uneven development, conflict, and  marginalization;  but  they are also the precious spaces that affirm cultural identities, nurture popular cultural production, and provide sanctuary for people with long histories of displacement, land loss, repression, and collective  struggle. In  this way, barrios share a great deal in common with African American ghettos. According to Diego Vigil, both spaces derived from people’s experiences of having to “settle in inferior places that were spatially separate and socially distanced from the dominant majority group” (2008, 366; also see D. Diaz 2005). This spatial and social isolation exacerbated economic, political, and social marginalization and contributed to powerful narratives of racial and cultural difference, which both stigmatized residents and justified their continued marginalization. But as many scholars, artists, and activists have noted, “There is another side of this view of segregation” (Beveridge 2008, 358). This involves individuals making a conscious choice to live in spaces that circumvent, as much as  possible,  their stigmatization  by  whites and to pursue opportunities to “develop on their own in their own communities” (Beveridge 2008, 358; also see Jackson 2001). It is precisely this other side of barrio life—as a space for cultural affirmation, ethnic solidarity, collective determination, and  nostalgia—that  leads its residents to defend and preserve  these spaces  in the face of powerful stigmatizing forces. As Raúl Villa notes, the barrio is “a complex and contradictory social space” (2000, 8). In short, <em>el barrio </em>is simultaneously a place, space, and metaphor with a range of meanings for scholars, policy makers, residents, and artists (Pérez, Guridy, and Burgos 2011).</p>
<p>Cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago have long histories of barrio formation, which share important structural similarities as well as notable differences. As with African American ghettos and Chinese enclaves, racism, residential segregation, poverty, and social marginalization were structural forces giving shape to barrios beginning in the late nineteenth century. In Los Angeles, for example, Mexican residents were relegated to “ecologically inferior neighborhoods” like East Los Angeles as a result of land loss, demographic shifts, and public policy measures, which racially marked and socially isolated Mexican residents in the city (Vigil 2008, 366; Villa 2000; D. Diaz 2005). Similar histories of dis- possession and displacement also led to the formation of El Barrio (also known as East Harlem or Spanish Harlem) in New York City, with the initial arrival of thousands of Puerto Rican migrants in the early twentieth century; in the post–World War II era, the barrio grew rapidly as a result of U.S-led industrialization and economic and so- cial displacement in Puerto Rico (Sánchez Korrol 1994; Dávila 2004). While specific geopolitical and economic forces set populations in motion to U.S. cities, barrios developed as a result of specific policies on the local, state, and federal levels, which not only caused in and codified racial segregation, but also reflected    patterns of unequal urban development that contributed to the proliferation of substandard and limited housing stock and poor schooling, as well as severely circumscribing people’s economic mobility (Logan and Molotch 1987; Fernández 2011; Pérez, Guridy, and  Burgos  2011).  In the popular imagination, early twentieth-century barrios were replete with social pathologies, disorder, and disease. Similarly stigmatized, their residents were the object of policy interventions aimed at ameliorating social ills through, for example, public health campaigns and Americanization efforts. These efforts often focused on women as potential agents of change in the name of protecting the broader public from social and physical ills originating in barrios and their residents (Ruiz 1998; Briggs 2002b; Molina 2006; Mckiernan-González 2012). Thus, while the specific plans and policies that led to the creation of diminished social and economic mobility were increasingly invisible to the broader public, barrio residents were increasingly visible, stigmatized, and regarded as a problem that needed to be solved.</p>
<p>Despite negative characterizations, barrios are spaces where meaningful communities, social networks, cultural institutions, businesses, and social organizations are created and sustained.  They  are  places  that  offer “some security in the midst of the city’s social and economic turmoil” (Griswold del Castillo 1979,  150) and “preserve the integrity of [people’s] cultural place-identity within and against the often hostile space regulation of dominant urbanism” (Villa 2000, 5). As Arlene Dávila observes, places like El Barrio (Spanish Harlem) in New York City have a kind of preciousness not only because they are the spaces where people have worked, engaged in collective struggles, and built communities, but also because through these efforts, residents have “imbued space with meanings and memories” (2004, 64). For many scholars, el barrio is a unique and critical space to  nurture distinctive  forms of   cultural production, political organizing, and solidarity (Ybarra- Frausto 1989; Muñiz 1998; J. Flores 2000; Villa 2000; Gaspar de Alba 2003; Rivera 2003; Nabhan-Warren 2005; Treviño 2006; Iber and Regalado 2007; Cordova 2011). Creative writers have also focused on el barrio as a way to explore issues of individual and collective survival, violence, assimilation, resistance, and self- discovery (Thomas 1967; Galarza 1971; Cofer 1980, 1995; Cisneros 1984; L. Rodriguez 1993). And still others have directed their efforts at providing historical context and critical analysis in order to address and ameliorate the criminalization, marginalization, and social dislocation of barrios and their residents (Dohan 2003; Díaz-Cotto 2006; Vigil 2007; Rios 2011).</p>
<p>Although barrios often tend to be conceptualized in homogenous terms, they have always been far more heterogeneous, serving as home to a range of people from different national origins, class positions, and distinct racial, gender, and  sexual identities. Historic barrios  in urban centers serve as important settlement communities for newcomers from different Latin American and Caribbean nations, who have often significantly transformed the cultural landscape. The changing demographics of barrios, along with urban development policies  upscaling  formerly  marginal  barrios, has  had a dramatic impact on many communities and has ushered in community organizing efforts to preserve the use value of working-class neighborhoods (Villa 2000; Dávila 2004; G. Pérez 2004; Rúa 2012). These efforts have also been buttressed by powerful narratives of uplift that provide yet another way of conceptualizing barrio: it is a metaphor used to capture spatial, social, and economic mobility. From prominent U.S. congressional representatives (Gutiérrez 2013) to well-regarded businessmen, narratives of leaving barrios for boardrooms (Rentería 2011), Capitol Hill, and the Supreme Court (Sotomayor 2013) provide poignant insight  into the unique struggles Latina/o communities face in their efforts to gain access to quality education, housing, health care, social services, and public recognition not only for their own self-improvement, but also their commitments to improve the lives of the communities from which they come. As sociologist Jody Agius Vallejo observes, upward mobility for middle-class Mexican Americans leaving “barrios for burbs” defies the conventional wisdom that presupposes assimilation and integration into white middle-class society by the ways their middle-class aspirations include familial obligation, a desire to give back to one’s community, racial and ethnic identity, and civic participation (2012a).</p>
<p>Over the course of the twentieth and early twenty-first century, barrios have become ubiquitous features of American cities, a reality that underscores the enduring legacies of spatialized inequalities in urban America. Neoliberal urban development policies beginning in the 1990s not only hardened of the contours of some barrios in cities like Chicago and New York, but also opened up new development strategies that relied on the commodification of cultural spaces as entities to be marketed and sold (Dávila 2004). Sometimes, as in Chicago’s Puerto Rican neighborhood of Humboldt Park, community activists have successfully harnessed municipal resources to revitalize urban spaces in culturally significant ways, to resist the negative consequences of gentrification, and to preserve cultural institutions, practices, organizations, and identities. In other instances, as in Union City, New Jersey, the Latinization of urban spaces is contested, undermined, and dismantled in the name of revitalization and urban redevelopment, processes that increasingly rely on private investment and reflect racial and class hierarchies (Londoño 2012). Thus, while some scholars have pointed to the curious ways that the New Urbanism—with its emphasis on live-work spaces, walkable neighborhoods, face-to-face encounters,  and communal public space—is, in fact, what David R. Diaz and Rodolfo D. Torres (2012) refer to as “barrio urbanism,” they also emphasize how these trends often do very little to ameliorate the political and economic forces that continue to generate and sustain spatialized inequality based on class, ethnicity, and race. Barrios, therefore, remain complex and complicated spaces that play an important role in Latina/o social, political, and scholarly work. They are enduring reminders of dire material conditions in which many Latinas/os live, work, and build meaningful lives; yet they also highlight el barrio’s deep cultural, material, and symbolic meanings for so many who seek not only to ameliorate economic and social conditions, but also to preserve them as precious spaces that nurture and sustain cultural identities and ways of living and being and as spaces of hope, resistance, and radical possibility.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Borders are fictions of material consequence, created by empires and fortified with the invention of the modern nation-state. They restrict the limits of territory and mark the transition between kingdoms, colonies, and private land holdings in advanced capitalist societies. Where national territory or private property begin and end, borders signal the essence of power relations. The actual geographic spaces of borders tend to be highly contested. Particular to Latina/o studies, the boundaries of Spanish and Anglophone empires and of the nation- state pervade how we theorize borders and borderlands in the field. While some borders are highly privileged and centralized, others are just as contested.</p>
<p>The subfield of borderlands theory emerged in the late 1980s. Part theory of language, part theory of subjectivity, and part theory of geography, it accounts for the relationship between the centers and margins of power, which are in dialectic tension for Latina/o populations. As Juan Flores and George Yúdice have stated, the “border houses the power of the outrageous, the imagination needed to turn the historical and cultural tables. The view from the border enables us to apprehend the ultimate arbitrariness of the border itself, of forced separations and inferiorizations. Latino expression forces the issue, which tops the agenda of American culture” (1990, 80). A generative site of theory, the study of borders and the borderlands subfield are essential to understanding of communities, self, and subject-formation.</p>
<p>We cannot know borderlands theories or geographies in Latina/o studies without considering how the colonization of the New World impacted the categorical formation “Latina/o” as an identity and subject position in the making. An expanded definition of borderlands would argue that an ocean can be a border, especially if we consider the history of Chinese migration to the Americas in the fomenting of a diaspora. So, too, can a river be a border, as in the case of the Rio Grande dividing Mexico and Texas. Intensifying the geopolitics of borderlands to include water as a defense line, especially in the case of the divide between Cuba and the United States, has created much of the discourse that dominates Latina/o studies today. Militarized <em>fronteras </em>infiltrate how we understand what it means to be Latina/o in the Américas. Moreover, the abstract concept of “border” becomes materialized through policing, inclusion, exile, and permitted passage, setting the stage for how the creation of a “border” morphs into a borderlands imaginary.</p>
<p>In this spatial ordering of the world, travel pathways, water, and mobility are privileged, not strict community and national boundaries. Borderlands theories come into being precisely because with the advent of British and Spanish Empires, contact contributed to a gradual and more intensified demarcation of territory over time. Porous psychic and spatial collisions of value and an expansive imagining territory as localized created the groundwork for the borderlands theories and histories we have come to know today. A multi-border perspective in Latina/o studies cites myriad international and psychic boundaries that acknowledge conflicts with Indigenous and Afro-descendent populations because these communities are at odds with their mestizo and Anglo contemporaries in the maintenance of territory and freedom. But we must also remember that the context of such communities historically pits civilization against barbarism. Violence represents a desire to at once stabilize borders and boundaries and track their fluidity. Fully steeped in militarized rhetoric, barbarism stays with us as a means of empire’s self-justification. An offshoot of borderlands theory is a discussion of mestizaje, the racial mixing of European, black, and Indigenous peoples. While many contemporary critics celebrate mestizaje as a form of cultural hybridity that will save us from domination, it is not a panacea. Similarly, native peoples and immigrants described with hostility and/or barbarity contextualize militarism as the basis of borderlands theories.</p>
<p>And yet, when we think of borderlands in Latina/o studies, we should also localize our conversation in Central American America (Arias 2003). Scholars like Ana Patricia Rodríguez (2009) and Claudia Milian (2013) deconstruct the configuration of the isthmus by pointing to the hierarchical nature of the north-south continuum as an uninterrupted cartographic binary. Their multi-nodal approach claims and reorients spatial dynamics of power and borderlands discourse in the Americas by turning our attention to El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and their respective diasporas wrought by U.S.-backed military interventionist wars in these nations. The view from the center, that which is Centroamérica, or what Kristen Silva Gruesz (2012) has called “Centrocéntrico,” is an intervention into cur- rent time-space continuums that dominate the field of Latina/o studies. By reorienting reading practices, we see that historical recovery becomes one of the fundamental methodological modes for redress by charting the isthmus as a U.S. Latina/o borderland.</p>
<p>The Haiti–Dominican Republic dividing line is also central to borderlands theory. Silvio Torres-Saillant (1997), Sibylle Fischer (2004), David Scott (2004), Ginetta E. B. Candelario (2007), Susan Buck-Morss (2009), Lauren Derby (2009), and Lorgia García-Peña (2016) all examine Hispanic Caribbean racial imaginaries to demonstrate how racial identification for the Dominican subject has historically been shaped by the actual and imaginary borders between the Dominican Republic and Haiti. The Murder of the Galindo Virgins on May 30, 1822, is one foundational narrative for Haiti-Dominican borderlands discourses. Of the three men who were convicted of killing the young girls, only one, Pedro Covial, was Haitian, and yet this event was used to mobilize the nascent Dominican nation against a vile black Haitian enemy. In addition, a notion of Hispanic culture became the means by which to identify Dominican nationals, while Indigeneity was the mechanism for explaining the racial mix that made Dominicans not black (García-Peña 2016). Haiti–Dominican Republic borderlands buttress Caribbean Latina/o studies’ theorizations of racialization— blackness and Indigeneity through spatiality—and extend U.S. land borders by influencing and constructing liminality, psychic spaces of conflict, and forced migration histories for Dominicans and Haitians on the mainland because of U.S. military interventions.</p>
<p>The U.S.-Mexico border dominates field-based borderlands theories, especially in early work by Américo Paredes (1995a), who examined the complex relationships that ethnic Mexicans had with Mexico and with the United States, as well as the dialectic tension between Spanish and English, cultural and political citizenship, and modernity and tradition in “Greater Mexico.” There is no doubt that the U.S.-Mexico border is “the” border in Latina/o studies, despite the fact that the very same border is more primary to Chicana/o studies. The fact that the United States and Mexico physically touch each other signals intimacy, conflict, and marginality. That intimacy has become the basis for institutionalization of regionalism and nationalism in Chicana/o and borderlands studies and their preoccupation with that border as a site of violence and conflict where cooperation and collusion of state powers deport migrants regularly and allow drugs to flow with ease.</p>
<p>For diverse reasons, Gloria Anzaldúa’s <em>Borderlands / La Frontera: The New Mestiza </em>(1987) is a hallmark of the field. A strong and unapologetic humanistic theory of the violence embodied in spatial and cultural clashes, Anzaldúa’s work addresses intimacy as a shrunken space between two individuals and two nations. Borderlands intimacy can be applied to any space of conflict, including the inner psyche of subject formation. In theorizing plural intimacies and sexual difference, she provides a template for how intersectionality (simultaneous compounding forces of race, class, gender, disability, sexuality, and generation) marks subjects for discipline and discovery. Clashes of culture and nations delimit how we cannot have the one object without the other (the United States without Mexico), as they are co-constitutive. And while the United States and Mexico have clearly maintained an uncomfortable intimacy for hundreds of years, the culture of injury and renewal harkens to racial mixing as much as it does to the flowing waters of the Rio Grande that separate the two nations geographically. Vague, undetermined, and fixed through an international border that determines the safe and unsafe, borderlands are everywhere and nowhere, and can impact the subject at any time. Norma Alarcón argues that “formations of violence are continuously in the making” (1996, 44), and the U.S.-Mexico border and the subjects who live along, around, or on it make the process possible. Borderlands theories of intimacy and violence are a means of reckoning with the “use of space to naturalize violent racial, gender, sexual and class ideologies,” as Mary Pat Brady has argued (2002, 6). Overall, borderlands theories provide intellectual and actual mobility that is often denied to those non-normative sexual or racialized individuals who live at the margins of society.</p>
<p>According to Antonio Viego’s understanding of the border subject via both Anzaldúa and Frances R. Aparicio (2003b), “Prior to living between two cultures,  the transmovement of the human subject is reflected in its movement between two or more signifiers. . . . Whatever split, whatever breech, or division implied by the term <em>border</em> is ultimately explained by social, cultural, and historical determinants” (2007, 128). Here, it is the borders of language and the use of psychoanalytic theory that form border subjects, not the actual U.S.-Mexico border. The middle land of <em>nepantla </em>is breech and rupture, and transmovement of the subject, which preexists contact with a physical border, even if a border shapes the psychobiography of a people. Metaphorically charged in nature, <em>nepantla </em>(a concept from the Nahuatl language extensively employed by Anzaldúa) and the ideas of border as signifier shape psychic borderlands. When Aparicio argues that “the theorization and development of the concept of a border subject and hybrid identity has been one of the most significant contributions of Latino studies to cultural studies” (2003b, 20), she dislodges the border subject and borderlands from a strictly Chicana/o and/or U.S.-Mexico paradigm. The concept instead demonstrates theoretical and geographic flexibility. The appeal for a Latina/o studies genealogy is not about authenticity (who gets to claim borderlands as their concept), but rather how we create our own narratives to challenge authority, document existence, and name the subject as a subject. Hence, borderlands theory is just as much about explaining the cutting up of lands, bodies, and psyches as it is about territorial disputes and disparate geographies of Latina/o studies.</p>
<p>While pivotal, decentering the U.S.-Mexico borderlands as “the border” reveals that the assumed cartographies of Latina/o studies are suspect and that when we evoke borders or borderlands, we need to provide our students myriad models of particular Caribbean, Central American, or Pacific flashpoints. This suggests that in addition to stressing 1848 (the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that established the U.S./Mexico border), we must recognize 1822 (the Haitian invasion of the Dominican Republic), 1898 (the Spanish-American War involving Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Filipinas), and U.S. military interventions in Central America during the 1980s. With these particular time-space imperial referents, the middle, Central America and the Caribbean, disrupt the U.S./Mexico binary. That middle would suggest that Central Americans, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, and even Filipinos are not the newest Latina/o groups but rather, as Gruesz points out, “a newly visible subgroup” (2012).</p>
<p>The very real geography of borders and borderlands, and the kinds of violent  racist  regimes  they produce, is, thus, not just a fiction on the page but in fact the cleaner version of lived and embodied experiences. The Latina/o multi-border perspective can both reorient the narrative history of the Americas and account for the ways in which particular racial or sexual formations such as those of queer, Afro-descendant, or Indigenous populations tend to be erased from the Latina/o United States. The multi-border analytic can guide us to consider comparatively or synchronically, the historic relational and distinct experiences of Spanish colonial spatial organization (the specificities of Spanish empire in the Americas and elsewhere, in relation and conflict with American imperialism), or borderlands as mutually constitutive. Perhaps a  multi-border  perspective on borderlands is the rubric Latina/o studies needs to unseat particular kinds of celebratory and recuperative nationalisms, mestizajes, and epistemologies that stake their claims in land, essentialism, or authenticity. Borderlands, then, should always be hemispheric, plural, and multi-sited. The Latina/o studies scholar and student must not take for granted the definitions of borders or borderlands. We must question why certain borders are privileged as sites of intellectual inquiry over others. The hemisphere is our borderland.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brown is not an identity. Brown, along with its nominal form, <em>brownness</em>, are also not objects of knowledge in the ways that identity markers such as “Latina/o” or “Chicana/o” are in the late twentieth and early twenty- first centuries. The more popularly used ethnic marker aligned with a certain hue or accent of brownness, “Latina/o” is widely understood as designating a population historically displaced from Latin  America and living in the United States. Other identity variants exist within the Latina/o population that are assigned  to people from specific national and cultural heritages; the most widely used of these is the politically charged banner of Chicana/o, which signifies a person of Mexican descent or origin living in the U.S. Southwest. The definitional incoherence of Latina/o—let alone Chicana/o, Cuban American, Nuyorican, and so on— reveals how not all identities capture the people, lives, and experiences they seek to  demarcate.  As  a  result, the aesthetic realm, particularly colors such as white, black, yellow, red, and brown, points to the impossible collection of people under one racial or ethnic category in the United States.</p>
<p>The categorical crisis within race and ethnicity in the United States from which brown gains its political importance reveals how brown is hard to categorize as well, and especially when one tries to make sense of brown as a temporal phenomenon. Sometimes brownness evokes an eerie anticipation for what José Vasconcelos (1925) termed <em>la raza cósmica</em>. The cosmic race might be understood as a speculative fiction describing a future wherein an agglomeration of all the races will yield a Universópolis, a new civilization formed without respect to color since all will be a part of <em>la raza de bronce</em>. The alloyed components in bronze seem to promise, like Vasconcelos, the successful outcome of mixture and thus of a unified <em>polis </em>to come. On the one hand, brown tells a story of the ongoing mixing of all races, driven by a postracial ideology that then ignores the incommensurable differences of those singular beings organized and managed by oppressive regimes. In her essay “La Güera,” the Chicana lesbian thinker Cherríe Moraga has warned that in the United States “lesbianism is a poverty—as is being brown, as is being a woman, as is being just plain poor. . . . The danger lies in failing to acknowledge the specificity of the oppression” (Moraga 1983a, 29). “Brown” ambiguously signals unity and distinction. This makes brownness hard to ignore since it terrifies those who attempt to whitewash history. White supremacist America flails in anxiety at the imminent threat of immigrant bodies, consequently revealing <em>his </em>logic within the artificial naming of brown people as <em>his-panic</em>. Brown folks are coming, goes the idea, in droves as displaced labor and thus browning <em>nuestra América</em>—a very different America than the Cuban poet José Martí might have imagined. What color was the United States before, one might ask? Was it not already brown? Indigenous peoples of the Americas have always <em>been here</em>, is also how the logic goes. Contrapuntally, brown people are either on their way or have always been here. But this paradox of recent arrival and simultaneous long presence reveals the very logic of brownness in the contemporary moment: that is, the United States must <em>become </em>what it already <em>is</em>. In this way, we might even ask, what karmic, though not necessarily punitive, logic discloses itself in brownness?</p>
<p>This question begins to ask how brownness might evoke some form of depressive or    antiestablishment pedagogy, in the sense that even when considered in a political vein, brown remains highly ambiguous if not capacious in its meaning. For example, <em>The Karma </em><em>of Brown Folk </em>tells us how brown as a racial signifier is capacious enough in its reach not only to signal Latina/ os or Indigenous peoples within the United States, but also to move transnationally and mark what some call the “global South” (Prashad 2000). From Latin America across South Asia to Frantz Fanon writing in Algeria and up to the present day occupation of Palestine, the karma of brownness runs, on the one hand, as the ongoing if not ubiquitous struggle of anticolonial resistance, while on the other hand, always mysteriously symbolizing what Prashad calls “a fantasy of redemption for the trials of the world” (2000, 2). It can be said that brown— even in the harrowing irony of Hugo Ferdinand Boss’s famously designing and manufacturing the SS uniforms in black and brown—stands as the very color of dis- placement and also the color of fascism. These displaced bodies are signs of displaced futures. After all, any white fantasy of redemption must cover over the loss of the future for some within the here-and-now. It does this by negating brownness, while demanding more labor, more capital, and more care from those it exploits and seeks to put in constant deferral.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, brownness reminds us that this world is never really enough. The loss constituting brownness is not nothing. Far from figuring as lack, brownness stages the smoldering indention of its own vulnerability by exposing itself to erasure in the very act of longing, such as in the brown art work of Ana Mendieta and Felix Gonzalez-Torres. If brownness tells a story of dispossession, then it is this history of divestment that gives back to brownness its own meaning, modifying a field of possibility often dominated by white colonial forces. The brown struggle recalibrates the political dimensions in which it finds itself entangled and opens itself onto the ontological possibilities of its emergence. Such maneuvers showcase how brownness possesses its own ontology and how this ontology is first and foremost a doing (an action). No better example showcases the vulnerable longing structuring brownness than the far-reaching lyrics of the popular bolero “Sabor a mí,” written by the late Afro-Mexican singer Álvaro Carrillo. The song is noted for its migratory stretch across Latin America’s sonic landscape, iterated in many covers including Luis Miguel, Olga Guillot, and the late 1990s Chicana lesbian punk band Las Cucas. The lyrical nuance under- girding the haunting, if not maledictive refrain, “sabor a mí,” outlines the arrested development of a seemingly healthy codependent contract between the singing subject and the object of desire. “Sabor a mí” rewrites the relationship between Latin America and the United States into a narrative about an ongoing harvesting of the U.S. Empire from an unrequited longing to be loved (González 2011). However, the forlorn hope swelling the present tense of the lyrics only exacerbates, like brownness, the future tense as always carrying a remainder/ reminder of a persistent past that, however vulnerable, refuses its own negation: <em>pero allá tal como aquí / en la boca llevarás / sabor a mí (for there as well as here / in your mouth you will carry / the taste of me)</em>.</p>
<p>Similarly, “brown” carries a delectable etymology. Beyond an adjective that just names the rich color, the word “brown” can describe something as dark or dusky. As a verb, it marks the process of something cooking, or someone becoming upset. In Old English, “brown” connoted duskiness in color yet brightness in polish, the latter still being operative in the contemporary use of the word “burnish.” Indeed, the interplay between opacity and clarity, darkness and light, is the study, as in the <em>room</em>, for brownness. “Brown study,” an idiom referring to a state of deep thought or abstraction, might be thought of in tandem with the subfield of academic research known as “brown studies,” which usually focuses on the histories, politics, and cultures of “brown people.” More interestingly, the potential for brown as an object of study anticipates brown as a methodology and a mode of reading. Swati Rana has argued that the future of what she calls “brownness study” depends on a certain formalist literary hermeneutic attuned to the “ideological manifestations of the millennial discourse of race, and also the inconsistencies within them, thereby opening a critique from the inside out” (2015, 299).</p>
<p>José Esteban Muñoz also understood how brownness moves from the inside out,  enabling  a  critique that opens and shares outward to the world rather than shutting down and closing off the world’s prospects. In “Feeling Brown,” Muñoz begins by thinking of brown as a bridge between ethnicity and affect, a bridge where those Latina/o citizen-subjects congregate in exile from the majoritarian sphere since they  are  performatively and affectively blocked from accessing normativity (Muñoz 2000). Feeling brown for Muñoz then takes on a choreography addressing not only social and affective norms, but also the psychic life of the historically displaced subject. “Feeling brown, feeling down” becomes a way to translate Melanie Klein’s psychoanalytic  notion of the depressive position into a brown vernacular that most importantly “link[s] position with feeling,” thereby making positions “provisional and flexible demarcations, practices of being” (Muñoz 2006, 681). Much like Klein’s depressive position, the underbridge known as brownness survives in the face of heavy pressure from corrective regimes, because it is malleable to change and seeks to rework the world from the position of the problem. In other words, just like a bridge, brownness works as an avenue of feelings aiding in the seemingly impossible project of belonging in difference. This project/projection requires empathy, and Muñoz was most attuned to this vital sense. In “‘Chico, What Does It Feel Like to Be a Problem?,’” Muñoz argues: “There is something emphatic about this shared affective construct I am calling Brownness, this response to a certain negation within the social that corresponds to this question of feeling like a problem” (2007, 445–46). Feeling like a problem describes a situation where excusing one- self from the coercive mimetic demands built in to what it means to be Latina/o in the United States—hot, spicy, over-the-top, unaware, unwavering—means producing a certain knowledge that exists outside of knowledge itself. Here is what Muñoz called a brown otherwiseness, a particular rerouting of knowledge into “imagining a provisional de-universalizing of reason for the express purpose of imagining and describing multiple modes of being, feeling, and knowing in the world” (2014, 250).</p>
<p>Belonging in difference sometimes feels impossible in a world that threatens to correct the mistakes  of brownness. However, it is precisely the act of sharing this impossibility with others that helps Muñoz re-understand brownness as a <em>sense</em>. Moving beyond what Raymond Williams calls the “structure of feeling” (1977, 128–35), Muñoz argues that the sense of a cultural object and one’s <em>manera de ser </em>(way of being) does not necessitate knowledge to do the work of explaining their respective value.  Similarly,  brownness  exists  outside of value, and as a historical form persisting within the here-and-now, yet radiating—from the inside out—as something incalculable, like “art, friendship, love, thought, [and minoritarian] knowledge” (Muñoz 2011, 197). Muñoz’s rigorous work on brown mirrors the vital trajectory of brown’s own dedication at remaining unfinished, an intellectual itch refusing satisfaction. These incommensurable, impure, and “arduous modes of relationality” are what constitute brown’s vital resistance to mere identification (Muñoz 2015). In fact, lingering within a brown study and refusing cathartic determination—“I cannot reconcile”—is how the writer   Richard Rodriguez closes his ruminations on brownness in his collection of essays, <em>Brown: The Last Discovery of America </em>(2002, 224). Perhaps like Rodriguez’s last discovery of Anglo-America, Muñoz will too discover in his still unpublished <em>The Sense of Brown </em>the failure of reconciliation to be the onto-poetic ground in which we find our contemporary United States of America.</p>
<p>It is precisely because brown fails to reconcile itself as an identity-knowledge project that the study of brownness is always an investigative process into the vital phenomena of mixture and immiscibility. This failure  of mixing unmixable things comes to figure, quite ironically and much like the act of burnishing a table, as the refinement of knowledge in the face of an increasing anti-intellectual United States. Such refinement in thought is far from the purported apoliticism of aesthetic theory, since the rub, as it were, lies within the production of friction often negatively misrecognized as inciting the <em>feeling</em> of irritation or depression, as in the English phrase “browned off.” This political irritation is part-and-parcel of what Ronald Sundstrom (2008) has called the “browning of America” and more recognizable in the shrill re- marks of Samuel Huntington’s (2004a) response to the browning of America as the “Hispanic Challenge.” To brown America is to bring it down, depress what is notably and nobly understood as White America, thereby staining it and dragging it to its limits. Even the philosopher of colors, Goethe, associated brown, a color he did not necessarily enjoy, with seriousness and melancholy. The sobering intensity of the disenfranchisement of minoritarian people in the United States is nothing less than browning the way we understand the misapplication and abuses of those suspended realities known  as justice, democracy, and freedom. Here is the drama within the color brown: it is itself a mixture of yellow, red, and black—the iridescent reminder that we are in brownness and of brownness, here and now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first use of the word “capitalism” has been credited to an 1855 British novel, <em>The Newcomes</em>, which narrates the story of an English family who became wealthy through business and marrying into money (Thackeray 1996). While the term retained associations with wealth, “capitalism” is commonly linked to Adam Smith and Karl Marx, two political economists whose writings about society were published one hundred years apart and who held opposing views regarding capitalism. These views became schools of thought and have influenced and divided the world in opposing camps until today. What follows briefly describes (a) key elements of Smith’s and Marx’s views; (b) the roots of capitalism in the Latin American region;  and  (c) the nexus between capitalism and migration from the Dominican Republic to the United States.</p>
<p>Capitalism is a mode of production that stimulates the private ownership of the means of production, the use of free labor, and the increasing accumulation of capital. It also generates capitalist ideology, a system of beliefs that justifies the system’s existence. Capitalist ideology is maintained and reproduced by the sword if needed; it permeates society’s institutions and people, ensuring the reproduction and development of capitalism.</p>
<p>Many scholars link the rise and spread of capitalism to the European discovery and colonization of the Americas. In 1492, Spain took possession of a new world loaded with land, minerals, and peoples. José Carlos Mariátegui describes Spain’s penetration into South and Central America as follows: the Spaniards “plundered the treasures of temples and palaces; they allotted land and men with no thought of their future use as forces and means of production” (1971, 1). Other European empires followed suit, particularly Portugal. Soon, England, France, and Holland, armed with cannons, also demanded to share in the treasures uncovered in the new lands. By the end of the seventeenth century, the continent had been totally transformed: from masters of their own destinies, the aboriginal populations became the property of a few European warfare nations; the immense wealth of the New World landed in the coffers of the invading nations. Ways of life and thinking were profoundly altered forever. The discovery of America by Spain created the nexus between capitalism and the new lands and their people.</p>
<p>European nations competed for primacy and control of the transatlantic market. The massive wealth appropriated by each provided abundant capital to solidify a European capitalist class that invested in the economic development of these nations. The raw and unprocessed cotton brought from the New World, for instance, nurtured a manufacturing industry that transformed this fiber into textiles and then into wares that were sold everywhere, including among aboriginal populations and African slaves who were forced to cover their tropical bodies in the name of European decency. This transformation alone changed the world forever and created a lasting garment market that extended almost throughout the world. In the end, the rise of capitalism was intrinsically connected to the growth of mercantile-maritime cities; to transatlantic routes that interconnected a rich new land to a wealth-seeker Old World, and to a commercial nexus and exchange of commodities, all made possible through the conquistadores, whether Spanish preachers, Portuguese missionaries, or English Pilgrims.</p>
<p>In <em>An Inquiry into The Wealth of Nations</em>, first published in 1776, Adam Smith described the essential components of capitalism, one of which is the pursuit of individual wealth. Smith relates the desire for personal wealth to a man’s particular self-interest. A man can expect to have returns from others, Smith said, when he shows them “that it is  for  their own  advantage  to do for him what he requires of them” (1937, 14). During Smith’s time, wealth and capital were synonymous, and capital, which Smith defines as that part of a man’s possession that is used to generate his wealth (1937, 262), was in his view available to all people. Smith believed that man’s self-regard motivated him to accumulate capital. Rooted then in an innate attribute—man’s self-interest—the creation of wealth is, in the end, cumulative and generates <em>the wealth of a nation </em>because “by pursuing his own interest [man] frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it” (1937, 423).</p>
<p>In <em>Capital: A Critique of Political Economy</em>, first published in 1867, Karl Marx challenged Smith’s generalized view about the relationship between capital and people’s intrinsic aspiration. Marx argued that “capital comes dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt” (1984, 712). Man’s self-interest is not a noble attribute that culminates in collective wealth. Quite the contrary. Marx pointed out that “at the historical dawn of capitalist production . . . avarice, and desire to get rich, are the ruling passions” (1984, 556) and that pursuing personal interest causes the misery of others since “the capitalist gets rich . . . at the same rate as he squeezes out the labour-power of others, and enforces on the labourer abstinence from all life’s enjoyment” (1984, 557). Accumulation of wealth is in this view, not a human trait, but rather a characteristic of capitalism.</p>
<p>If the peoples and the lands of the Americas were transformed  into  colonies  by mercantile-imperialist capitalism in the age of Spanish, Portuguese, British, French, and Dutch conquest, the era of independence and the establishment of republics in the Americas brought a socioeconomic  and  political  realignment of the world in which the United  States emerged as  the new empire. The nascent United States grew up equipped with a capitalist ideology that, as Christianity in the hands of Spain, became a powerful platform to rationalize its way of life and its imposition upon all others on earth. The United States penetrated the lands of their neighbors and through their mighty economic power and war armaments ensured its hegemony in the region and created the infrastructure to geometrically increase the wealth in its coffers. Primary accumulation, the appropriation of enormous economic resources by a group in a given society, served the United States well, as it became, speedily, the decision-maker for the nations, peoples, and places under its boots (Harvey 2003).</p>
<p>In capitalism, the need to accumulate is constant and shadows capitalists everywhere. Latin America’s largest neighbor, “el coloso del Norte,” began to expand its territory and capital right after its declaration of independence in 1776. Mexico, for instance, lost much land to the United States in 1848 after capitulating in a war that the United States declared in the name of its presumed rights to such lands. Moreover, the Progressive Era, a period roughly between 1898 and 1924, characterized by increasing economic prosperity in the United States, is also the time when the United States intensified its presence and dominion in Latin America through military invasions in Puerto Rico (1898), Cuba (1898 and   1906), Panama (1903), the Dominican Republic (1907 and 1916), Nicaragua (1909), and Haiti (1915). The 1916 U.S. military occupation of the Dominican Republic provides a clear example of modern capitalism on its imperialist stage.</p>
<p>Countries engaged in war do not engage in much agricultural production. Europe had long been the world’s largest producer of sugar, but World War I hindered European countries’ ability to produce sugar during that time, or other agricultural products for that matter. But while the production of sugar, mostly from sugar beets, declined drastically—along with that of coffee, tobacco, and cacao—demand for it had not. Meanwhile, the Dominican Republic had the historical capacity to abundantly produce those commodities. Indeed, it is there that the sugar industry was born in the New World (Bosch 2016).</p>
<p>The United States presumably feared an intervention in the Dominican Republic by European nations and used this fear to justify the 1916 U.S. military invasion of the island; the U.S. Marines stayed in the country until 1924. The Dominican government owed money to European countries and could not make payments. Similarly, various factions of the Dominican elite were engaged in struggles for power, keeping Dominican society politically unstable. As the war continued, the demands for sugar increased and so did its price. Between 1905 and 1914, the price of 100 pounds of sugar remained roughly at $5.50. By 1920, the price had increased to $22.50 (Moya Pons 2013). The production of agricultural commodities was so lucrative during the war years that Latin American countries that produced such goods experienced a moment of economic boom popularly known as “la danza de los milliones” (Moya Pons 2013). Many of these millions, however, went into the coffers of the United States, which controlled the economies of various countries in the region.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the Dominican Republic, the U.S. occupying forces put into motion a primary accumulation process that permanently impoverished thousands of Dominican people who once owned their lands. Such primary accumulation also provided the United States with abundant labor and capital at once, readily available to generate profit. It is having control of a large quantity of both labor and capital, the two most important factors of production, which undergirded the enormous amount of wealth found in the hands of some people or in the arks of some nations and not their investment in resources or in sweat.</p>
<p>The U.S. government implemented legislation that benefited its own capitalists: it reduced the taxes on U.S. imports to the Dominican Republic, thereby inundating the Dominican market with American products, sending local producers who could not compete into bankruptcy. A new agrarian law required Dominican peasants to present the titles of ownership of their lands. But very few had such titles: Dominican land tenure was based on communal ownership, making individual titles unnecessary. The state, represented by the U.S. military government, appropriated all lands from those who could not present the newly required documentation. Thus, many Dominicans became landless and unable to sell their products. Landless peasants and former producers joined the ranks of the proletariat, or those who must sell their labor to earn a living. Eventually, part of the disposed, impoverished, working Dominicans, unable to make a living at home, would find their way to the United States in a forced migration process that put them, ironically, in the same society that had effected their uprooting in the first place.</p>
<p>U.S. capitalists involved in sugar plantations bought Dominican lands sold by the U.S. military government on behalf of the Dominican State. In 1924, when the U.S. Marines left the Dominican Republic, there were twenty-one sugar plantations. Of these, eleven belonged to two American corporations: the West India Sugar Finance Corporation and the Central Romana Corporation, Ltd. Of the remaining ten plantations, five had dependent relations with the Central Romana Corporation. When the Central Romana Corporation was established in the country, it had a declared capital of $450,000 and a territorial extension of 17,486 <em>tareas</em>, equivalent to almost 2,717 acres. However, in 1925, the value of this corporation increased to  $9,961,349  and its territorial extension to 931,792 <em>tareas</em>, equivalent to almost 144,781 acres. In other words, its original capital had multiplied 21.5 times and its territory 53 times (Bosch 1981).</p>
<p>The occupying American military government built roads connecting the country from north to south and from east to west. As horses and carriages were replaced by automobiles and became obsolete, all inputs, including the asphalt for the resplendent roads, the gas for the cars, and the cars themselves, had to be imported. In the end, U.S. capitalism transformed Dominican society into one that produced what it did not consume and consumed what it did not produce.</p>
<p>Marx believed that workers follow capital. Indeed, 1.5 million Dominicans live today in the United States, the majority of whom came seeking a better life. However, migration represents just a change of geography for many of them. They live in a capitalist society not too different from the one they left behind. Poor at home, the majority of them, now transformed into Hispanics or Latinas/os, continue to be poor in the new abode. How their future will evolve, depends as much on them as on the socioeconomic system they will partake in.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Self-naming is political, ideological, and resistant. “Chicano” remains thus inflected, true to its emergence in activist communities of the 1960s and 1970s to signify  self-determination,  working-class  origins,  and a critique of social relations of power. Although not entirely clear who first appropriated “Chicano” for this usage, it is generally accepted that at one time the word circulated in Mexican Spanish as a negative reference to the “lower classes.” Its appropriation by students and activists transformed it into an empowering alternative to “Mexican,” “Mexican American,” or “Hispanic.” To name oneself as “Chicana” or “Chicano” is to assert a gendered, racial, ethnic, class, and cultural identity in opposition to Anglo-American hegemony and state- sanctioned practices of representing people of Mexican descent in the United States. As it evokes the “radical” politics of cultural nationalism, “Chicano” stands against the institutionally normative “Hispanic,”  as well as the linguistically insistent “Latino” (Alcoff 2005). Always associated by Chicanas and Chicanos with State attempts to classify, homogenize, and deracinate, “Hispanic” is typically linked to conservative political values, even as it is often the name chosen in English    by many in the U.S. Southwest who in Spanish might call themselves <em>tejana </em>or <em>mejicano</em>. In the U.S. Southwest, “Mexican American” most often appears in academic program names and Chicana and Chicano studies scholars tend to use “Mexican American” and “Chicana/ Chicano” interchangeably.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom holds that a “Chicana” or “Chicano” is a Mexican American who knows their own history. “Mexican American” is understood to refer to    a person of Mexican descent born in the United States, while “history” refers both to the sixteenth-century Spanish conquest of Mexico and to the nineteenth- century  Anglo-American  colonization  and  settlement of the southwestern United States. The meaning is expanded to include those who may have migrated from Mexico as children, but were socialized and educated in the United States. Journalist Rubén Salazar, in an article published after his death in 1970, wrote that “a Chicano is a Mexican-American with a non-Anglo image of himself” (1970, B7). His definition establishes the specificity of Chicana and Chicano identity in relation  to other Spanish-speaking communities, and also implies that most people of Mexican descent in the U.S. do <em>not </em>know their own history. Salazar’s emphasis on historical knowledge is a commentary on the absence of Mexican American content across the K-12 curriculum, which is again being recognized in the U.S. popular media (Rich 2012). This suppression of historical and cultural knowledge enforced what Salazar and others would call “Anglo images” of Mexicans that exist in popular culture. Neither positive nor uplifting, the representations have been simplistic and narrow, focusing on impoverished workers, lawless gangsters, and female vixens, to name  a few (Berg 2002). Consequently, the structuring and packaging of curricular material throughout the U.S. education system, in which people of Mexican descent have had little input, has assured the alienation of Mexican Americans.</p>
<p>Chicano educational activists began focusing on curricular content during a period of U.S. political activism from the 1960s to the early 1980s known as “the Chicano movement,” or “el movimiento.” The ideological base was cultural nationalism, modulated at times by Marxist social critiques of capitalist class systems or new appreciations for Indigenous ancestry and history. The Indigenist forms of Chicano nationalism, originally influenced by post-revolutionary Mexican cultural politics, have been most enduring. In art, literature, and cultural practices such as <em>danza</em>, activists and artists reclaimed Indigenous influences on the historical mestizaje, or mixture, that produced present-day Mexicans and Mexican Americans, or mestizas/os (mixed-race or mixed-blood people). Filmmaker Moctesuma Esparza elaborates in the “Pride and Prejudice” episode of the PBS television series <em>Latino Americans </em>(2013): “When we identified with the word ‘Chicano,’ our understanding was that it was the same word that is the root word for ‘Mexico,’ which is the name of the Aztec Indians, and their name was ‘Mexica.’ . . . And when you drop off the first syllable, ‘Me,’ you get ‘Xica,’ which becomes ‘Chicano.’ MeXICANO. And that’s what we were.” The “X” is here pronounced “sh,” a feature of Mexican Spanish that documents the impact of the Indigenous language of Nahuatl on the European language of the colonizers.</p>
<p>Los Angeles high school teacher Sal Castro became  a formative influence on Esparza and other students when he started to integrate educational material that affirmed Mexican cultural identity. He was instrumental in the 1968 Chicano student walkouts, or “blowouts,” modeled on the <em>huelgas</em>, or labor strikes, used as a negotiation tactic by the United Farm Workers. Students walked out of class in protest of treatment by school- teachers and administrators, curricula that did not include Mexican American history, art, or literature, and the school-to-military and school-to-prison pipe- lines. Their demands included more Mexican American content in classes and the hiring of Mexican American teachers and administrators. Their efforts also impacted higher education as Chicano studies programs and departments were established, primarily in the U.S. Southwest, and especially at the community college level in California (Acuña 2011). But “Chicano studies” was never the term of choice on the East Coast of the United States, where Latina/o communites had origins throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. And as political conflict and military repression forced the migration of thousands of Central and other Latin Americans in the 1980s, Latina/o  communities  throughout the United States became more diverse. In California, however, the demographic reality had already been uniquely acknowledged and documented in San Francisco State University’s early decision to forgo “Chicano Studies” in favor of “Raza Studies” and, later, “Latino Studies.” Similarly, in Detroit, Wayne State University’s 1972 program began as the “Center for Chicano/Boricua Studies.” Other Chicano studies programs in California and the Midwest have made recent name changes to reflect more accurately the populations they serve and to move beyond narrow definitions of the field. Over the last decade, we have seen a preference for “Latino” (or Latina/o) in academic program names in recognition of the diversity of Spanish-speaking people in the United States (U.S. Census Bureau 2015). This reconfiguring of Chicana/o studies to Latina/o studies has broadened the scope of scholarly activity, transforming teaching content and enriching the experiences of students, faculty, staff, and community engaged in and by the study of U.S. Latinas/os.</p>
<p>The blowouts show the transformative potential of positive curricular  intervention  and  the  significance of formal education as a site of identity-formation and politicization. It is true that many Mexican Americans “become” Chicana or Chicano in college, but these identity shifts have been made possible by social movements. The political activism of the Chicano movement created academic communities of students and faculty and  resulted  in  curricular material that included  U.S. Mexicans. Nevertheless, most academic knowledge continues to emanate from a perspective that is decidedly European, heterosexual, and male.</p>
<p>As a term of self-identification, “Chicano” is not accepted by all who could claim it. There is considerable debate about the extent to which the larger Mexican-descent community ever adopted “Chicano.” Some scholars hold that it was popular primarily among students, with little acceptance outside of academic activist circles, as Albert Camarillo wrote in 2013. Maurilio Vigil (1977) argues that older, more conservative Mexican Americans did not accept the radical political ideology associated with “Chicano,” while Juan Gómez-Quiñones contends that the term was “rejected as pejorative on the political right and by middle class people while at the grass roots it was questioned because Mexicano was preferred” (1978, 13). José Limón (1979) dismisses the notion that Mexican Americans were simply political conservatives  who  did  not  like the “radical” ideology of “Chicano.” Instead, he writes, the broader range of Mexican-descent people did not identify with the “style” of its usage, which was “fundamentally a rejection of a performance context judged as inappropriate for this essentially folkloric term” (1979, 20). But Martha Cotera, in her introduction to her 1976 <em>Diosa y Hembra </em>(Goddess and Woman), announces that “the term Mexicana, Chicana, Mexican American and Hispana woman is used throughout interchangeably simply because the author and the Central Texas community she lives within does exactly this” (1976, 2).</p>
<p>Membership in the group of those who would call themselves “Chicano” was thus self-regulated by individual choice, but it was also regulated by the collective. Not all Mexican-descent subjects were readily incorporated into these nationalist, activist communities; women and those who were gay, lesbian, bisexual, or trans* tended to be excluded. Richard T. Rodríguez reminds us that “gay, lesbian, and feminist struggles were often seen as antithetical to Chicano liberation” (2011, 113). Dominant Chicano political and activist critique of social relations of power did not willingly or easily extend to analyses of how gender and sexuality inflected power, a reality exposed by Cotera and other Chicana feminists. And when it appears here, the use  of the masculine form of the noun “Chicano” is intentional, meant to reflect the truth of <em>el movimiento</em>: it was heteronormative, male-dominated, and male-centered. Language purists may argue that the use of the masculine “Chicano” is simply the correct standard Spanish grammar for mixed-gender groups of people. Early Chicana feminists never accepted this logic, and were critical of masculinist politics from the beginnings of movement activism (A. García 1997; Blackwell 2011). Angie Chabram said it brilliantly: “And she enters movement discourse with her own name, a name which constructs her both as Chicana and a woman and subverts the twin myths of malinchismo and assimilation” (Chabram-Dernersesian 1992, 86). Chabram, like many Chicana feminists, critiques nationalism while still claiming national belonging. She speaks to the power of self-naming, while also countering misogynist interpretations of the life of one of Mexico’s most significant female historical figures, La Malinche / Doña Marina, interpreter and advisor to Hernán Cortés. Inserting this feminine form of the noun—ChicanA—into Chicano movement discourse demanded inclusion and challenged sexism in the movement, while at the same time refusing to negate community.</p>
<p>This Chicana critique of Chicano politics circulated through verbal interventions at local, regional, and national conferences, as well as in publishing venues (Cotera 1976; Martínez 1998). Adelaida del Castillo’s groundbreaking 1974 essay on La Malinche was especially  transformative  (1977).  Poetic  challenges to movement patriarchy have existed since the 1970s period of Chicana literary history; examples include Lorna Dee Cervantes’s 1975 “Para un Revolucionario” (1993) and Carmen Tafolla’s 1978 “La Malinche” (1993). The choice of whether or not to align with feminist principles, however, was a topic of intense debate among women in the movement (Longeaux y Vásquez 1997). In 1982, women created Mujeres Activas en Letras y Cambio Social (MALCS) to provide space for initiatives and agendas that they were at that time unable to pursue in the National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies (NACCS).</p>
<p>Over time, these critiques have become more central to the field as scholars have refused to forget Chicana feminist interventions, acknowledging their foundational impact on contemporary scholarship and research. This recognition became evident as academic convention shifted, for the sake of brevity, to “Chicana/o” in place of the longer “Chicana and Chicano.” Around the turn of the last century, a new iteration emerged, “Chican@,” part aesthetic response to the cumbersome punctuation of the former abbreviation, part recognition of emergent digital identities, and part as an instance of queering or making queer. Another variation, which has been in use since at least the 1980s, is “Xicana” or “Xicano,” a reference to the Indigenous origins of Mexican-descent people. Poets Alurista (1981) and Cherríe Moraga (2011) have used this spelling in work that spans thirty years.</p>
<p>More recently, language and letters have again shifted. A new iteration gaining acceptance and usage recenters the exploration of race, class, gender, sexuality, and relations of power: “Chicanx.” The “x” signifies fluidity and mobility, setting aside the conventions of ideological, philosophical, and medical binaries that assign humans to one gender identity out of two when they are born. The “x” in “Chicanx” is nonbinary; it acknowledges self-determinations that refuse immovable assignments of identity. This transformation of “Chicano,” from its beginnings in narrow understandings  of  subjectivity  and  experience,  contains  within it these histories of internal critique and oppositional struggle. The “x,” now at the end, rather than the beginning, urges us onward, advancing a social analysis that honors mobile, uncategorized ways of being and expression.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Citizenship, as we know it, is a technology of modern state power. It is the elementary political form by which people—embodied persons embedded in dense and complex  webs  of  social  relations—are  reduced to “individuals” who may be abstractly figured as “equals” before the law. The modernity of this form of power derives precisely from the notion that the rule   of man (as in a monarchy or an aristocracy) has been irreversibly replaced by the rule of law. As abstract individuals, therefore, all citizens are ostensibly equal, commensurable, effectively interchangeable, as  the law is supposed to apply uniformly to all, and no one is supposed to be enduringly subjected to personalistic and hierarchical forms of domination and dependency. Citizenship therefore  corresponds  to  a  social  order in which everyone is presumed to voluntarily and “freely” engage in exchange, whether it be the exchange of goods for money, or much more commonly, the exchange of the capacity to labor for money wages. In short, citizenship is a political form that abides by the abstract rules that govern the capitalist marketplace.</p>
<p>The legitimacy of modern state power, furthermore, is presented as originating from a mythical covenant,  a “social contract,” among naturally free and equal individuals. Thus, the power of the state is purported to derive from the natural-born power for self-government that is said to reside within each and every individual. Once people are gathered together into some sort of political “community,” the effective freedom and equality that are considered to be everyone’s birthright become not an individual power of self-government but a collective one. Citizenship, then, is necessary to translate this wild, “natural” freedom into the sort of politically and juridically defined liberty that can be used to justify the authority of the state as the “democratic” expression of a popular will. The state’s sovereignty now appears to be legitimate, ostensibly derived from the innate and natural sovereignty of “the people.”</p>
<p>In the name of freedom and equality, in other words, citizenship serves to subject people as “individuals” to state power. Simultaneously, citizenship inscribes people as proper “members” belonging to an imaginary, abstract, and artificial political community of equals, usually called “the nation.” This is how citizenship serves  to stitch together such exalted notions as “freedom,” “equality,” “democracy,” and “human rights” with state power and nationalism.</p>
<p>As citizens, we are fashioned as the supposedly free and equal subjects of “democratic” self-government, while in fact citizenship is how we are made the <em>objects </em>of modern state power. Likewise, despite its broadly inclusive and egalitarian mystique, once we locate citizenship as a kind of legal personhood within a polity defined by the territorial borders and juridical boundaries of a state, it becomes clearer that citizenship is always an inherently exclusionary and divisive framework for the production of various degrees of non-citizenship and thus, legal non-personhood. In this respect, we can only properly assess the true meaning of citizenship from a global perspective that is not confined within the borders of any particular state formation. Nonetheless, each citizenship tends to be configured at precisely the “national” scale of a particular (territorially defined) state, and can be properly examined only in the context of the sociopolitical history that has been shaped and disciplined—indeed, <em>bordered</em>—by that particular (nation-)state.</p>
<p>In the United States, citizenship was never originally intended to include people who were not considered to be “white.” The very first Congress enacted the newly independent nation’s very first law explicitly dealing with citizenship through the Naturalization Act of 1790, in which no immigrant would be permitted to become a citizen unless he were “a free, white person.” Just three years earlier, in 1787, the Constitution had already been proclaimed on the basis of upholding the notion that enslaved Africans and African Americans were not persons in any substantive sense, that they were merely property. Similarly, the Constitution treated the Indigenous peoples of North America as entirely “outside” the U.S. “nation” and beyond the pale of “civilization.” Because Blacks and Native Americans were deemed to be inherently and irreversibly inferior, they were judged to be incapable of  self-control  and  thus incompetent for self-government, and hence disqualified from any prospect of citizenship. By a cruel and twisted logic, those who were enslaved were likewise presumed to have somehow found themselves in that condition because of a “natural” weakness, a “slavishness” that was alleged to be inherent in their racial non-whiteness. It followed by the same merciless logic that citizenship, associated with the capacity for self-government, would be guarded as  the preserve of  so-called whites—even  if the law never troubled itself with providing a definition of this commonsense category of the social regime of white supremacy. The racial whiteness of these prospective migrants, furthermore, was coupled with their status as “free,” meaning that even if they were considered to be “white,” they could not become U.S. citizens if they were indentured laborers or otherwise dependent upon and dominated by the rule of a master. Their citizenship—their equality before the law—would have to correspond to their social condition as “free” labor, able to sell their capacity to work for a wage in  the marketplace. From its inception, therefore, U.S. “democracy” had white supremacy as its defining bedrock, and U.S. nationhood was forged through an unabashed white nationalism.</p>
<p>The problem of Latina/o citizenship consequently always turned on the question of race. The first major historical episode in the encounter between Latinas/os and citizenship in  the  United  States  ensued  from the war of conquest through which the United States invaded and militarily occupied Mexico. After having debated whether or not to take the whole country and herd the majority of Mexicans onto the equivalent of Indian reservations, the view that prevailed was that the United States wanted as much Mexican land as possible inhabited by as few Mexicans as possible. Thus, with the conclusion of the war in 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo established a new border roughly corresponding to the Rio Grande (Río Bravo), by which roughly half of Mexico’s national territory was annexed. The newly colonized Mexicans who already resided in the occupied territories of what has since come to be known as the U.S. Southwest  were  given  the choice  to  leave, to retain their Mexican citizenship and thus become “foreigners” in their native land, or to do nothing and automatically become subjects of the United States, to “be admitted, at the proper time (to be judged of by the Congress of the United States) to the enjoyment of all the rights of citizens of the United States according to the principles of the Constitution” (Griswold del Castillo 1990, 189–90). This language is sometimes mistakenly interpreted to mean that the Mexican inhabitants of the newly conquered territories were assured U.S. citizenship. In fact, this language subtly deferred the decision about citizenship to the adoption of the respective state constitutions, which eventually instituted white supremacist provisions for the citizenship of “white Mexicans” only (Griswold del Castillo 1990; De Genova 2005, 215–21). The great majority of former Mexican citizens who might have been entitled under the treaty’s apparent protections saw their putative citizenship systematically subverted. Most were despoiled of their land, and their ostensible civil rights were routinely violated, often through outright racist terror.</p>
<p>The very limited extent to which the treaty genuinely enabled citizenship status for Mexicans, however unstable and insecure, came only with the compulsory requirement that citizenship be racialized as the preserve of “white” men. This was put to the test in a racial prerequisite case for the Naturalization Act of 1790—<em>In re Rodriguez </em>(1897). In that case, a federal court in Texas considered the application for citizenship of Ricardo Rodríguez, a migrant from Mexico, whose petition for naturalization was initially rejected on the grounds, simply enough, that he was “not a white person,” that he was “one of the six million [Mexican] Indians of unmixed blood.” For his part, Rodríguez declared that he was a descendant of neither Indigenous nor Spanish ancestors, and identified himself racially, quite frankly, to be a “pure-blooded Mexican.” Rodríguez’s legal defense was formulated by T. M. Paschal. Notably, Paschal concurred that Rodríguez was truly an undesirable candidate for naturalization and could rightly be denied eligibility for citizenship on the basis that he was indeed racially an Indian, and  otherwise  an  ignorant  Mexican,  illiterate in both English and Spanish. However, the racial prerequisite cases for naturalization simply did not apply to Mexicans, Paschal contended, because the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo had extended to Mexicans the same rights and privileges enjoyed by whites and therefore had treated Mexicans, de facto, as virtual “whites.” Mexican migrants, he reasoned, had therefore to be granted the right to apply for citizenship as an exception to the racial rule, out of respect for federal law. Positing the absurd legal fiction that Rodríguez was “white” according to the treaty’s provisions of citizenship for Mexicans, the court concluded that the applicant was indeed eligible for naturalization (De León 1979; Haney López 1996, 61–62; Martinez 1997b; Menchaca 2001, 215–76, 282–85;</p>
<p>Gómez 2007, 139–41; Molina 2010). Apart from these legal casuistries, the <em>In re Rodriguez </em>decision became the basis, for a time, for a special exception made for Mexicans within the U.S. immigration and naturalization regime during the early twentieth century. The incorporation of Mexican/migrant labor nonetheless relied precisely upon the racial subjugation of Mexicans in order to secure their subordination as labor. Thus, by 1930, in the wake of mass migration from Mexico during the first decades of the twentieth century, the U.S. Census Bureau had come to officially designate “Mexican” as    a separate and distinct “racial” category (Gómez 2007, 152; Molina 2010, 197). In 1933, furthermore, the U.S. Supreme Court revisited the issue of Mexicans’ putative whiteness by treaty, and called the <em>Rodriguez </em>precedent into question (Haney López 1996, 242n37).</p>
<p>The other major formative encounter of Latinas/os with the regime of U.S. citizenship, historically, was the colonization of Puerto Rico following the Spanish- American War of 1898. In an echo of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the Treaty of Paris,  which  concluded the war with Spain, declared, “The civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants of the territories hereby ceded to the United States shall be determined by the Congress.” Whereas Spanish inhabitants of the newly annexed colonies could choose to retain their Spanish citizenship, the “natives” were stripped of any former citizenship and summarily reduced to colonial subjects of the United States (Perea 2001, 156). The fact that U.S. political and legal authorities considered Puerto Ricans to be an “alien race” was the recurrent justification for excluding them from U.S. citizenship (Perea 2001, 155–61).</p>
<p>Then, two decades later, the Jones Act of 1917 unilaterally conferred U.S. citizenship upon Puerto Ricans, collectively, and legally abolished their prior quasi-status as “citizens of Puerto Rico.” Without the consent or participation of the Puerto Rican people in the change of their juridical status, and in flagrant disregard for any organized expression of  their political  desires, the grant of U.S. citizenship was an unequivocal affront to Puerto Rican sovereignty and independence aspirations (Cabranes 1979; Cabán 1999; Burnett and Marshall 2001). In effect, the extension of citizenship to Puerto Ricans irrevocably tied the fate of Puerto Rico to the United States (Carr 1984; Cabán 1999). Furthermore, the law’s passage in 1917, on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War I, ensured for many Puerto Ricans that the most palpable significance of their newfound citizenship status was that it made Puerto Rican men eligible  to be drafted into the U.S. military. Approximately sixty thousand Puerto Ricans—more than 12 percent of the island’s adult male population—were conscripted into military service during the First World War (Carr 1984, 65). Puerto Ricans’ citizenship, while expanding their legal “duties” to the U.S. nation-state, did not even safe- guard for them the full protection of the Bill of Rights    or other constitutional guarantees of the presumed “rights” of citizens (Smith 1997, 433; 2001). In the 1922 decision of <em>Balzac v. Porto Rico</em>, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, for example, that in an officially “unincorporated territory” such as Puerto Rico, the constitutional right to trial by jury did not apply (Cabranes 1979, 49; Burnett and Marshall 2001; Rivera Ramos 2001; Thornburgh 2001). In addition to the extension of U.S. citizenship, the Jones Act established that the island’s governor would continue to be imposed from the mainland and thus would be a federally appointed (non-Puerto Rican) U.S. official. Likewise, the U.S. president and Congress would retain veto powers over any act of  the new Puerto Rican legislature, and thus would never be beholden to any legislative expression of the Puerto Rican people (Carr 1984, 54–55). Meanwhile, Puerto Rico would have no representation in the U.S. Congress, and the island’s inhabitants would not be permitted to vote in U.S. national elections. This restriction on Puerto Rican citizenship remains in force today, such that the mainland-versus-island residence distinction  sustains an unequal two-tier structure for Puerto Rican political rights. Inasmuch as they were denied equal rights to political participation, Puerto Ricans were thus bestowed with a decidedly “second-class” citizenship as the juridical expression of their colonial subordination.</p>
<p>Hence, rather than the presumptive ideal of inclusion and belonging, citizenship for Latinas/os has long been a technology for their racial subordination, deployed as a means for their unequal, contradictory, and differential inclusion/exclusion within the legal regime of the U.S. state (De Genova and Ramos-Zayas 2003; De Genova 2005). In this light, rather than the customary liberal plea for the belated realization of the egalitarian promises of citizenship, our greatest challenge is to cultivate a radically open-ended imagination about how to enact various forms of political struggle beyond and against the treacherous allure of citizenship (De Genova 2010).</p>
