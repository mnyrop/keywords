<p class="pf"><i>Adult</i> derives from the Latin <i>adultus</i>: “full-grown, mature, firmly established.” To be an adult, the root implies, is to reach the endpoint of a developmental arc—to attain the physical, behavioral, and social norms of maturity—but this fantasy of fulfillment is tenuous. <i>Adult</i>’s first <i>OED</i> definitions are adjectives, unmoored from a stable subject. <i>Adult</i> might make <i>any</i> person full grown; it also makes an attitude sophisticated or a movie erotic. <i>Adult</i>’s noun form—“a person who is fully developed; one who has reached maturity”—is similarly volatile, its boundaries porous enough to let in its supposed opposite, the child. Half the quotations the <i>OED</i> provides in support of this definition reference children, many aligning adult and child experiences. (Herbert Spencer, for example, wonders “what rights are common to children and adults.”) Compounds yoke adults to ideas associated with young people: <i>adult student</i>, <i>adult illiteracy</i>. The word’s desultory travel between subject and descriptor emphasizes the contradictions at its heart, inviting us to explore the fraught relationships between adult and child.</p>
<p>Scholars frequently cast adult-child relationships as oppositional and mutually constitutive. In <i>Centuries of Childhood</i> (1960), French historian Philippe Ariès claims societies invented childhood when they acknowledged what “distinguishes the child from the adult” (128). Subsequent studies insist on the importance but fragility of the boundary between adult and child; in the 1980s, Neil Postman lamented the erosion of “the dividing line between childhood and adulthood” (1982, xii). Despite such anxieties, the adult remains a flexible and remarkably resilient antonym for the child, reinforced by legal norms such as ages of consent and political participation that mark (arbitrarily) a young person’s acquisition of the rights and responsibilities associated with maturity. Spaces such as the school or nursery allow adults to both isolate and regulate children’s bodies but are, in turn, often featured as home base in texts that playfully exclude adults, as in the work of E. Nesbit.</p>
<p>The adult-child binary leads scholars to parse the characteristics we assign each: innocence versus knowingness, vulnerability versus power. These oppositions form the bedrock of the most persistent notions of childhood, including the Romanticism epitomized in Wordsworth’s cloud-bedecked infant, a creature alien to the experience-imprisoned adult, or the nostalgic moppets championed by some Golden Age authors who exile children to Wonderlands inaccessible to adults. The opposition between adult and child also lurks in the intergenerational enmity often at the center of children’s books: Roald Dahl’s Matilda battles the Trunchbull; Pan terrorizes Hook. According to Jacqueline Rose, Perry Nodelman, James Kincaid, and Karín Lesnik-Oberstein, our insistence on imagining adult and child as contraries <span id="p2" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="2"></span>reveals that childhood is a construction that responds to adult desires from the nostalgic to the sexual.</p>
<p>Critical accounts of children’s literature posit that the stark divide between adult and child continues to shape the genre in profound ways. In <i>The Pleasures of Children’s Literature</i>, Nodelman and Mavis Reimer argue that children’s literature could not exist “until adults came to believe that children were different from adults in ways that made them need a literature of their own” (2003, 81). In turn, adults—whose social and economic power exceeds that of children—create and purchase books that produce docile or desirable children inside and outside the text. One of the most fertile lines of inquiry in children’s literature scholarship since the field’s origins has been the interrogation of children’s culture as a vehicle for adult ideologies. In <i>The Hidden Adult</i>, Nodelman argues children’s literature is “an adult practice with intentions toward child readers” (2008, 4), while others examine the particular historical circumstances that drive adults to use children’s literature as a mouthpiece. In <i>Learning from the Left</i>, for example, Julia Mickenberg identifies children’s texts as “a key outlet for leftists in the mid-twentieth century”; radical writers turned to young audiences because “other avenues were closed to them” or because they sought to “influence the future through the younger generation” (2005, 5). Such studies assume, to varying degrees, models of adult authority and child receptivity figured as author-audience, teacher-student, parent-child, or colonizer-colonized.</p>
<p>In response, some consider the ways children’s literature militates against adult authority, destabilizing the adult-child binary that assumes the former’s power. While Maria Nikolajeva acknowledges the “aetonormativity” of children’s literature—the “asymmetry between children and adults” that “governs the way children’s literature has been patterned from its emergence until the present day” (2010, 8)—she argues that children’s literature can “subvert its own oppressive function” (9), pointing to Astrid Lindgren’s <i>Pippi Långstrump</i> (1945; trans. <i>Pippi Longstocking</i>, 1950) and its heroine’s strength and social capital. Similar reversals motivate F. Anstey’s <i>Vice Versa</i> (1882), Janusz Korczak’s <i>Król Maciu</i><span class="dcrit-i">ś</span> <i>Pierwszy</i> (<i>King Matt the First</i>; 1986), and Mary Rodgers’s <i>Freaky Friday</i> (1972). Cross-writing—defined variously as the simultaneous address of adults and children, the “dialogic mix of older and younger voices,” or the movement of texts across audiences—disrupts hierarchies of adult author and child receiver (Knoepflmacher and Myers 1997; Falconer 2009). Sandra Beckett notes that this blurring of audiences has generated cross-linguistic terms—Norway’s <i>allalderslitteratur</i> (literature for all ages) and Germany’s <i>Bruckenliterature</i> (bridge literature)—and has led to presses like Spain’s Las Tres Edades (The Three Ages). Cross-writing reminds us that the divide between adults’ and children’s literature has always shifted and sometimes disappeared. Consider H. Rider Haggard’s <i>King Solomon’s Mines</i> (1885), dedicated to “all the big and little boys,” and nineteenth-century American children’s poetry, which Angela Sorby and Karen Kilcup argue was both connected to and distinct from adult verse.</p>
<p>In tension with the adult-child opposition is the assumption that children follow a linear trajectory of growth into adulthood. This model emerges in developmental theories by Piaget, Freud, Erikson, and Froebel as well as in contemporary theories in psychology and sociology that outline norms in mental, biological, and social development (Hockney and James 2003; Mintz 2015). In children’s literature, familiar plot patterns and genres—the didactic text, the home-away-home narrative, the bildungsroman—reiterate growth from child to adult (Trites 1998; Tribunella 2010), while texts such as E. B. White’s <i>Charlotte’s Web</i> (1952) or Natalie Babbitt’s <i>Tuck Everlasting</i> (1975) feature <span id="p3" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="3"></span>protagonists who learn the proper progression of childhood, maturation, and death. Roberta Seelinger Trites (2014) attributes the recurrence of metaphors of growth in adolescent literature and its scholarship to the fact that growth is an embodied, cognitive concept that structures our understanding of both adolescence and its narratives.</p>
<p>Yet we often accuse adults of acting like children—an insult that registers adulthood’s precariousness. Truly, any number of contingencies might preclude a subject from claiming adulthood at all, force a subject into adulthood prematurely, or leave them stranded in between. In <i>The Queer Child, or Growing Sideways in the Twentieth Century</i> (2009), Kathryn Bond Stockton examines the “sidelong movements” of not only queer adults and children, who cannot embody linear development because they have “simply nowhere to grow,” but also children as a category, whose “slow unfolding” belies maturation’s vertical movement (3, 4). Stockton raises fundamental questions about how we define adulthood. Who gets to be an adult? If we imagine adulthood requires, for example, economic independence, self-sufficiency, marriage, and reproduction, who is included in and excluded from its status?</p>
<p>Considering adulthood through race, class, gender, and their intersections raises similar questions. Anthropologist Alcinda Honwana explores how high unemployment rates in Mozambique, Senegal, South Africa, and Tunisia force young people into “waithood,” or “a prolonged period of suspension between childhood and adulthood” (2012, 4) in which they cannot participate in economic and heteronormative familial institutions—a state that resembles the “boomerang generation” or “adultolescents” in the US or <i>parasito shinguru</i> (parasite singles) in Japan, similarly stranded by hostile economies (24). Women, queer people, and people of color in the US and beyond have been oppressed as perpetual children (Field 2014; Halberstam 2011), while black children have been misread as adults in a racist narrative that stretches from at least the nineteenth century to the present, evidenced by systems of structural racism and acts of police violence against black youth (Bernstein 2011b; Epstein, Blake, and González 2017). Children’s literature reflects the violence of designating a child as an adult or vice versa through texts that participate in this practice, such as Defoe’s <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> (1719) and its childlike Friday, or that critique it, such as Angie Thomas’s <i>The Hate U Give</i> (2017) and its depiction of the consequences of misreading black teens as violent adults.</p>
<p>Emerging critical conversations surrounding child agency provide avenues to further interrogate adulthood’s ideological freight by refusing to presume adult power and examining the ways children adopt, negotiate, or resist adult discourse. Richard Flynn’s study of June Jordan’s partnerships with children, Rachel Conrad’s research on child writers, Robin Bernstein’s theory of scripted and scripting children, and Katharine Capshaw’s exploration of children’s participation in the civil rights movement all reimagine adult-child relationships to consider connections and collaborations, rather than differences and enmities, between generations. These approaches require revising naturalized narratives of development. Marah Gubar, for example, proposes an alternative “kinship model,” which holds “that children and adults are fundamentally akin to one another, even if certain differences or deficiencies routinely attend certain parts of the aging process” (2016b, 299). This model accounts for growth as “a messy continuum, an ongoing process that involves losses as well as gains” (294). Detaching adulthood from a developmental narrative is a generative rebellion, opening multiple directions for our field to grow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="pf">The neglect of sustained, theoretical inquiry into the aesthetics of children’s literature is a symptom of our discipline’s history. As it developed in North America, the academic discipline of children’s literature emerged in the context of the canon-busting and -expanding cultural studies movements of the 1960s and ’70s, a theoretical milieu newly suspicious of objective claims of aesthetic value. In recent years, however, the global field has seen renewed interest in aesthetics as “sensuous knowledge,” a mode of apprehension inextricably bound to both history and ideology.</p>
<p>The word <i>aesthetics</i> has ancient roots, its earliest forms the Greek <i>aisthanomai</i> and <i>aisthetikos</i> (both summoning the idea of perception). In his seminal study <i>Aesthetica</i> (1750–58), Alexander Baumgarten reworked these ancient terms—including <i>aisth</i><span class="dcrit-i">ē</span><i>sis</i> (sensation)—into our more contemporary understanding of <i>aesthetics</i>. The term has oscillated between apparent opposites: aesthetic value as both subjective and universal, as perceived sensually but primarily understood via intellectual contemplation, and as inhering in objects themselves yet requiring cultivated judgment to be experienced. As Raymond Williams reminds us, Baumgarten uses the term to describe “beauty as phenomenal perfection” (1983a, 31). Lars-Olof Åhlberg argues that since Baumgarten, aesthetics “has mostly been conceived of as the philosophy of art, or, as the theory of the arts” (2003, 149), whereas “Baumgarten’s idea of aesthetics as the theory of sensuous knowledge has been all but ignored” (151).</p>
<p>In <i>Critique of Judgment</i>, Immanuel Kant complicates and extends Baumgarten’s insights. Whereas Baumgarten maintains that the aesthetic affects us solely through the senses, Kant argues that the beautiful encourages <i>intellectual</i> contemplation, famously linking beauty to taste. He writes, “<i>Taste</i> is the ability to judge an object, or a way of presenting it, by means of a liking or disliking <i>devoid of all interest</i>. The object of such a liking is called <i>beautiful</i>” ([1790] 1987, 53). He continues, “[If] someone likes something and is conscious that he himself does so without any interest, then he cannot help judging that it must contain a basis for being liked [that holds] for everyone” (53–54). Taste, then, is the ability to distinguish between what is “agreeable to <i>me</i>” (55) and what is <i>beautiful</i>, and taste rests, for Kant, on <i>sensus communis</i>, “common sense” (160), a sense that is counterintuitively anything but common. Common sense in the Kantian formulation is reserved for the educated elite, for there is a correct and incorrect apprehension of beauty—a quality that, Kant maintains, inheres in objects themselves. Some artifacts are beautiful and some are not. By linking beauty to taste, Kant marks the aesthetic as both subjective <i>and</i> universal.</p>
<p>The idea of “common sense” aesthetics becomes immediately tangled once children enter into the discussion of aesthetic value. Kant’s logic is seductive, and it no doubt informs ideological commonplaces like the teleological notion that children have not yet developed <i>taste</i>. This lack of developed taste explains why their tastes are often not in concert with those of cultured adults. Adults <i>know</i> that Chris Van Allsburg’s intricate pencil drawings are beautiful, whereas children may similarly (but wrongly) apprehend the new Dora the Explorer sticker book as beautiful (in Kantian terms, we might grant that the former is beautiful, whereas the latter would simply be agreeable to some; i.e., children).</p>
<p><span id="p5" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="5"></span>The construction of such aesthetic hierarchies generally runs contrary to the study of children’s literature, which, as a discipline, tends to focus on the ideological, social, and thematic implications of childhood texts rather than their aesthetic value. As a (usually) commercial medium, children’s literature also collides with the notion that mass-produced objects cannot also be art. In <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>, Theodor Adorno imagines an aesthetic continuum on which any given artwork’s placement depends on how autonomous it is of distortion “by exchange, profit, and the false needs of a degraded humanity” ([1970] 2004, 298). For Adorno, autonomous art is not the product of “socially useful labor,” and as a result, it resists “bourgeois functionalization” (298). In opposition to autonomous art, we have what Adorno calls “heteronomous” art. As Lambert Zuidervaart explains, heteronomous art is not adequately “independent from other institutions of bourgeois society” (1991, 227). That is, heteronomous art describes artworks “produced and received to accomplish purposes that are directly served by other institutions.” As examples, he includes “everything from liturgical dance to tribal masks, from advertising jingles to commercial movies.” (To this list we might add “children’s literature,” with its history of didacticism.) Since aesthetics has conventionally focused on fine autonomous art, ignoring popular heteronomous art, the gap between aesthetics and the discipline of children’s literature widens on both ends: the latter tends toward cultural studies and a postmodern aesthetic, whereas the former focuses on “fine art” to the exclusion of popular, agreeable art designed to entertain.</p>
<p>However, even within the discipline of children’s literature, we find scholars privileging work that suggests autonomous “fine art”—work that references canonical painting or literature, such as Laurent de Brunhoff and Phyllis Rose’s exploration of fine art in <i>Babar’s Museum of Art</i> (2003). Perry Nodelman, however, argues that children’s literature’s aesthetic appeal resides in its simplicity rather than its perceived complexity. He writes, “[Children’s texts] seem so simple and yet allow for so much thought. There’s something magical,” he continues, “about texts so apparently straightforward being so non-straightforward” (2000a, 2). Striking a blow against our tendency to canonize a priori texts of a more evident complexity, Nodelman explains, “I find more obviously complex texts much less magical” (2).</p>
<p>However, complex aesthetic questions haunt even seemingly straightforward texts. The retellings of Helen Bannerman’s <i>The Story of Little Black Sambo</i> (1899) occasion consideration of whether aesthetic taste can be decoupled from ideology or whether the two are inextricably bound. Although composed by a Scottish woman living in India, Bannerman’s illustrations, as Nina Mikkelsen writes, are “harsh caricatures” of Sambo and his family, all of whom appear “to be African rather than Indian” (2001, 260). Frequently amplifying that caricature, <i>Sambo</i>’s many unauthorized versions—which flourished in the US from the early to mid-twentieth century—featured new illustrations with increasingly egregious “pickaninny” imagery. Beyond its racist caricature, Bannerman’s art, as Michelle H. Martin writes, is “amateur,” consisting of “crude, somewhat surreal, and perhaps even child-like sketches” (2004, 3). Hardly what most aestheticians would label “high art.” If the book’s aesthetic and racist history seem to banish it from the category of the beautiful, many artists and scholars of taste (in the Kantian sense) claim to apprehend the beauty of <i>Sambo</i>, suggesting an inherent aesthetic beauty that—via new art—might be liberated from the story’s racist history. Julius Lester views the book as worth “saving”: with illustrator Jerry Pinkney, he reimages the story as <i>Sam and the Tigers</i> (1996). Similarly, Fred Marcellino reclaims Bannerman’s tale by situating <span id="p6" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="6"></span>it in India, beautifully reillustrating Bannerman’s only slightly revised text to produce <i>The Story of Little Babaji</i> (1996); likewise, Anne Isaacs and Mark Teague’s <i>Pancakes for Supper</i> (2006) changes the setting to New England and replaces Sambo with a white girl named Toby Littlewood. Yet in a Borgesian paradox, the traces of Bannerman’s text always inform its revisions. The story’s persistence suggests that the original is both aesthetically pleasurable <i>and</i> ideologically irredeemable.</p>
<p>Adult ideology, then, inflects our experience of the aesthetic, even as it leads us to police the children’s literature canon. Karen L. Kilcup and Angela Sorby’s anthology of nineteenth-century children’s poetry, <i>Over the River and through the Wood</i>, revises the historical record by omitting popular racist poetry for failing to conform to the editors’ “contemporary tastes and biases” (2013, xxi), providing readers with, as Katherine Wakely-Mulroney and Louise Joy note in their <i>Aesthetics of Children’s Poetry</i>, “a somewhat skewed vision of the poetry to which nineteenth century children were exposed” (2017, 14). Likewise, we rarely study Eugenio Cherubini’s <i>Pinocchio in Africa</i> (1911), accepting as apparent aesthetic failings the racist caricatures found therein. However, Cherubini’s decision to send Pinocchio to Africa differs little from J. M. Barrie’s decision to send the Darling children to an island filled with “Indians” in 1905 (<i>Peter Pan</i>) and again in 1911 (<i>Peter and Wendy</i>). Barrie’s deployment of “Indians” hardly differs from Charles Dodgson’s choice to have little Alice meet a hookah-smoking caterpillar: all emerge from a colonialist relationship with the world outside Europe, one that encourages aesthetic flourishes steeped in Orientalism. Jean de Brunhoff’s ([1931] 1961) <i>Babar the Elephant</i> also participates in the ideological suppositions found in Cherubini’s <i>Pinocchio in Africa</i>, implying that the world exists to be robbed, colonized, or—in Babar’s case—improved by interaction with the West (educated in Paris, Babar returns to Africa to be coronated). Indeed, ideology and aesthetics are so enmeshed that it has been—until recent years—all but impossible to perceive the racist caricatures that inform Dr. Seuss’s <i>The Cat in the Hat</i> (see Philip Nel’s <i>Was the Cat in the Hat Black?</i> [2017]).</p>
<p>As these cases illustrate, aesthetic debates haunt the periphery of our discipline, but those debates are rarely put in <i>terms</i> of aesthetics. This hesitance to summon aesthetics—to treat, as Gianni Vattimo puts it in <i>Art’s Claim to Truth</i>, the “ontological weight of art” ([1985] 2008, 44)—is tied to the politics and history of the discipline itself, one that is still negotiating a place in academia. Kenneth Kidd suggests these complexities when he avers, “For so long children’s literature wasn’t taken seriously, and just as it’s being granted greater respect, the academy is turning to cultural and area studies, theory and ‘everyday life’” (2002, 146). Kidd asks, “Will our emergent interest in children’s culture be indulged at the expense of the literary tradition we have worked so hard to champion?” His answer is an excited maybe, but he quickly insists upon his “enthusiasm about the shift away from a narrow vision of literature, criticism, and academic life”—and, we should add, a narrow view of what is aesthetically successful in children’s literature. Kidd’s response points to the productive tensions between literature and cultural studies. Any future conversations about aesthetics in children’s literature must be mindful of such productive tensions.</p>

<p class="pf">Current research in the arts and humanities operates in the wake of what has been termed the “affective turn” (Clough and Halley 2007). Since feminist and queer theory turned our gaze on the body, the emotions have become a major site of interest across the disciplines. The term <i>affect</i>, which derives from the Latin <i>affectus</i>, meaning “mental or emotional state or reaction,” is today used both generically as an umbrella term to indicate the emotions and more technically to designate a particular subset of this domain. Attempts to encapsulate the meaning of <i>affect</i> in shorthand are impeded by the fact that theorists of affect have taken pains precisely to distinguish <i>affect</i> from rather than as “feeling” or “emotion” and because <i>affect</i> acquires its significance as that which eludes conscious definition or straightforward articulation. Nevertheless, the <i>OED</i> ventures a definition of <i>affect</i> as a “feeling or subjective experience accompanying a thought or action or occurring in response to a stimulus; an emotion, a mood.”</p>
<p>This encapsulates something of the meaning that the early Christian thinker Augustine reserves for <i>affectus</i> as opposed to <i>passio</i>, two distinct motions of the soul. The Enlightenment tendency to refer to “passions and affections of the mind” (Cogan 1813) carries traces of this earlier discrepancy. In the nineteenth century, it was common to subsume such variegated terms within the overarching category of “emotion,” and the term <i>affect</i> and its variants dropped out of common usage. In literary criticism, the ensuing mid-twentieth-century lack of interest in affective terminology went in tandem with a suspiciousness toward emotion per se, a suspiciousness that is emblematized by W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe C. Beardsley’s essay “The Affective Fallacy” ([1954] 1970), which helped promote the sorts of disinterested attention to the formal properties of the words on the page that came to be associated with New Criticism. With the publication of <i>Affect Imagery Consciousness</i> (1962), however, psychologist Silvan Tomkins resuscitated the importance of affect, originating “affect theory” (1984). Since the 1990s, especially after the publication of Sedgwick and Frank (1995) and Massumi (1995), affect theory has opened up lines of inquiry in fields as diverse as history, politics, visual culture, literature, film, and more recently, children’s literature studies.</p>
<p>So what is affect? In the Anglo-European tradition, discussions of affect frequently reference Baruch Spinoza’s claim that affect relates to capacity: it is the power “to affect and be affected” ([1667] 1992). The greater our power to be affected, the greater our power to affect. Brian Massumi, capturing something of this Spinozan idea, refers to affect as “the experiencing of experiencing” (2015, 4)—as distinct from emotion, “the capture of affect in the interiority of a subject” (210). Affect is thus the body thinking or, put another way, the mental aspect of a bodily event—a sign that the body has recognized what it is undergoing. Massumi insists that affect is relational; it is produced by interactions between the subject and the world, or the subject and another subject. Affect, then, is not individual but transindividual; it is fundamentally social, shaped as much by what it interacts with as by the subject itself. In this, affect is fundamentally political or at least “proto-political”; it “concerns the first stirrings of the political, flush with the felt intensities of life” (ix). If children’s literature is <span id="p8" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="8"></span>also produced precisely to assist the child in navigating the intersection between subject and world and is necessarily concerned with the first felt intensities of life, then we might venture that the central preoccupation of children’s literature—indeed its currency, perhaps even its form—is, or at least relates to, affect. Certainly, the collective nostalgia evoked by totemic characters such as Winnie-the-Pooh, Anne of Green Gables, the Little Prince, and Pippi Longstocking indicates the extent to which children’s texts hold sway over the reader’s affects, often well beyond childhood.</p>
<p>Broadly, scholars agree that affect has certain attributes. For one, it is mobile: it is the expression of the body constantly in motion, triggered by both innate and acquired stimuli. Evolutionary biologists have suggested that affect differs from emotion because it involves “little or no cognitive evaluation” (Stein, Hernandez, and Trabasso 2008, 578). Affect, then, is an urgent, general, abstract amplifier. It resists stasis: it is ever-moving and hence intangible. We are therefore only ever dimly aware of it. In this, affect cuts across our usual taxonomical categories such as subjective and objective, mind and body, passion and reason. As a result, there is significant disagreement among scholars even on essential questions: How does affect differ from emotion, feeling, or mood? How does affect relate to thought or cognition? Is affect conscious or unconscious? Where does affect originate and where is it located? Can we control it? As Michelle Yik (2010) asks, is Chinese emotion unique or is affect universal across time and place? Is it influenced by gender, sexuality, or ethnicity? Do animals have affects? Could machines have affects? These are some of the questions that children’s texts have most urgently and imaginatively posed over the centuries: the evocation of animal sensibilities in Sarah Trimmer’s <i>Fabulous Histories</i> (1786) and Anna Sewell’s <i>Black Beauty</i> (1877) have altered readers’ capacities to appreciate the parallels between human and animal subjectivity; our ideas about the emotions of mechanical nonhumans have been shaped by the depiction of characters such as Tik-Tok in L. Frank Baum’s <i>Land of Oz</i> books. Indeed, emotional education is always implicitly at work in children’s literature, even—indeed especially—in picture books designed for the very young. Each of Stian Hole’s <i>Garmann</i> books, like Max Velthuijs’s <i>Frog</i> books, inducts its small readers into the philosophical, social, and psychological complexities of particular emotions (fear, guilt, love). It is in large part through children’s literature that we first learn about affect.</p>
<p>The importance of literature for our understanding of affect, and vice versa, has been much discussed in recent decades, since if “cognitive events and affective states are interdependent” (Antrobus 1970), then every act of language involves an expression of affect (Massumi 2015). Literary texts, as linguistic utterances, are performances of affect. To read a literary text is thus to uncover affect. To whom, though, do the affects contained in literary texts belong? Does the author generate them, or the reader, or the text itself? Do we catch affect through the process of reading, following Teresa Brennan’s (2004) argument that affect is contagious, or do we “incarnate” it, as Margaret Mackey (2011) has proposed of young consumers of literature, film, and video games? Is our subjectivity porous, susceptible to contamination by alien affects, our bodies taking “the shape of the very contact they have with objects and others” (Ahmed [2004] 2014, 2), or is the formation of subjectivity “dialogical,” as Robyn McCallum (1999a) has argued is the case in adolescent fiction? Certainly, the belief that literature is affectively dangerous—that it <i>in</i>fects us—is at least as old as Plato’s <i>Republic</i> (1966). But if literature operates on our emotions and can prompt what Theodor Adorno describes as “the subject’s capacity to shudder” ([1970] 2004) and what John Steen <span id="p9" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="9"></span>identifies as the “pleasure of mood” (2018), so too can music, dance, and visual art. Is there anything peculiar about literary affect?</p>
<p>Marco Abel has identified affects as “asignifying intensities” (2007, x). But language, unlike music, and unlike affect itself, is representational; it signifies something outside of itself. This introduces a distinctive complication: it prompts us to wonder whether literary texts are transmissions of affect or <i>signs</i> of the transmission of affect. Are the affects that we experience through reading literature real or artificial, firsthand or secondhand, particular or general? The recent growth of interest in literary cognition has sought to address precisely these questions by analyzing the interrelations between affect and narrative (Burke and Troscianko 2017), examining how emotion can help explain recurrent story patterns (Hogan 2011), and tracing the processes that occur in the embodied minds of readers (Burke 2011). Believing that affect structures and coordinates what we perceive by arranging and prioritizing relevant information, cognitive critics such as Zunshine (2001) and Oatley (2002) probe how readers navigate literary texts by drawing on their knowledge of real-life emotions to facilitate inference and experience empathy (Keen 2007). For some, this process is ethically neutral; for others, it carries morally virtuous possibilities (Nussbaum 2003). The role, both virtuous and potentially vicious, played by children’s literature in the acquisition of cognition has been central to recent work by Mike Cadden (2011), Roberta Trites (2014), and Maria Nikolajeva (2014). Where Cadden and Nikolajeva trace the ways in which narrative generates emotional identification in texts for young readers, Trites analyzes how it facilitates “growth” in older readers. Narrative, though, is not the only medium through which children’s literary texts transmit affect. The recent collection of essays edited by Katherine Wakely-Mulroney and Louise Joy (2017) has showcased some of the ways in which children’s poetry, through its reproduction of musical features and its workings on the child’s inner ear, stimulates affective pleasure that rests as much on the aesthetic as the semantic properties of words.</p>
<p>Since the “affective turn,” literary scholars have found affect lurking everywhere: in deconstruction (Terada 2001), abolitionist literature (Ahern 2016), contemporary literature (Vermeulen 2015), and literary depictions of torture (Richardson 2016). But its express pursuit into children’s literature has only more recently been opened up with a spate of publications in this field in the last decade. Bettina Kümmerling-Meibauer’s essay “Emotional Connection” (2012) sets out some important starting points for thinking about the representation of emotions in adolescent literature. Kerry Mallan (2013a) takes head-on the oft-asserted claim that children’s literature fosters empathy and questions the legitimacy of this belief through discussion of a range of multicultural picture books. David Rudd (2013) has examined the affective currents lurking in the Lacanian symbolism that he sees at work in children’s literature. Placing the focus more directly on the <i>purpose</i> of literary affect, John Stephens (2015) has championed it as a means by which young readers develop new “scripts” that enable them to understand literary works. In addition to these interventions to children’s literature theory that seek to better understand the role of affect at a general level, a number of works have also charted the significance of particular affects in given cultural contexts. Lydia Kokkola (2013a) has analyzed children’s literature’s negotiation of the affects associated with the Holocaust. Minjie Chen has reflected on the ways in which affects associated with the Sino-Japanese War were passed into the consciousness of the postwar generation through literature for young people (2016). Ute Frevert’s collection <i>Learning How to Feel</i> examines how children’s literature <span id="p10" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="10"></span>refracts shifts in our understanding of emotional experience through a discussion of the representation of individual emotions (anxiety, shame, homesickness, boredom) in their historical contexts (2014). More recently, a 2017 collection analyzes how texts for children are tools for “emotional socialisation, enculturation, and political persuasion” (Moruzi, Smith, and Bullen 2017, 2), showing how children’s literature shapes children’s cognitive and affective development and acknowledging the cultural specificity of literary affects: Doris Wolf’s essay, for example, reflects on the affective experience of collective trauma and reconciliation in Canada through a reading of Nicola Campbell’s <i>Shin-chi’s Canoe</i> (2008); Jon M. Wargo probes the queer Latin young adult experience of “feeling brown” in Rigoberto Gonzalez’s <i>The Mariposa Club</i> (2009).</p>
<p>As such studies have shown, children’s literature provides important understanding about how emotions work across place and time. Furthermore, if even a preverbal person is “infra-linguistic” (Massumi 2015, 213), and if we acquire affect through “events that occur during infancy, especially transactions with social environment” (Schore 1994), then children’s literature plays a foundational role in affect formation. A book such as <i>Ini Abasi and the Sacred Ram</i> (1966) by Nigerian author Ntieyong Udo Akpan shows how the act of reading can bind together a community through shared emotions and rituals; the series <i>Guri and Gura</i> (2002) by Japanese author Rieko Nakagawa habituates its readers toward certain quotidian affects, instilling social norms.</p>
<p>As J. A. Appleyard (1990) has shown, we are not born readers; we become them. As we learn to be affected by literary texts, so we learn affect, and so (for the more optimistic of critics, at least) we learn, in turn, to affect.</p>

<p class="pf">“But he doesn’t have anything on!” (Andersen 2004, 94). With these words, a child opposes adults’ hypocritical admiration of the naked sovereign proudly parading in Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale “Kejserens nye Klæder” (“The Emperor’s New Clothes”; 1837). Enacting agency, this child character makes an independent statement in opposition to the established adult order. Though the term can be traced back to the seventeenth century, its use within children’s literature studies is a recent phenomenon.</p>
<p><i>Agency</i> derives from the Latin verb <i>agere</i>, “to act,” an origin reflected in a contemporary definition: “Ability or capacity to act or exert power” (<i>OED</i>). More specifically, sociologists describe agency as “the power of actors to operate independently of the determining constraints of social structure” and “the volitional, purposive nature of human activity as opposed to its constrained, determined aspects” (Jary and Jary 1995, 10). During the last decade of the twentieth century, central figures in the new sociology of childhood—Allison James, Adrian James, Chris Jenks, and Alan Prout—draw attention to children as active participants in negotiating, shaping, and creating identity. As the “capacity of individuals to act independently,” the term <i>agency</i> “underscores children and young people’s capacities to make choices about the things they do and to express their own ideas” (James and James 2008, 9). This approach has led historians of childhood to investigate how children were “active in determining their own <span id="p11" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="11"></span>lives and the lives of those around them” (Heywood 2001, 4). When children are not primarily perceived as inferior or subject to the power of adults, descriptions of children’s relationships both with their peers and with adults become important in historical accounts of children’s lives (Heywood 2001; Mintz 2004; Appel and de Coninck-Smith 2013–15).</p>
<p>Attempts to counter a tendency to generalize about childhood agency have been ongoing at least since Jacqueline Rose famously declared that “there is no child behind the category ‘children’s fiction,’ other than the one which the category itself sets in place” (1984, 10). Rose’s work led to a critique of a transcultural, transnational, transhistorical concept of the “universal” child within the field (O’Sullivan 2004). Representing a constructivist position, Karín Lesnik-Oberstein views “‘the child’ as an identity which is created and constructed differently within various cultures, historical periods, and political ideologies” (1998, 2). In Germany and the Scandinavian countries, the French history of mentality offered another path to analyses of childhood and the relationship between adults and children in children’s literature, especially through historical perspectives (Ariès 1960; Ewers et. al 1989; Ewers 2001).</p>
<p>Recently, scholars’ focus on agency has challenged the adult-child binary opposition. In a special issue of <i>Jeunesse</i> (2016) on the term, Richard Flynn critiques “an overemphasis on children’s alterity, in a model of children as helpless or even as victims, implying that children exercise little to no agency in participating in and creating their culture” (2016, 255), a tendency he finds in Perry Nodelman’s work. Marah Gubar has proposed instead a “kinship-model,” focusing on the likeness and relatedness of children and adults as well as the heterogeneity within both categories. According to Gubar, growth must be regarded “a messy continuum” and not a fixed, general, and inevitable process (2016b, 294). Both Flynn and Gubar subscribe to the idea that even though children are born into societies where a certain discourse and specific social conditions determine aspects of their lives and identity formation, “that discourse is also shaped by the comportment, doings, and utterances of young people” (Gubar 2016b, 295). In the same issue of <i>Jeunesse</i>, Sara L. Schwebel (2016) questions the authenticity of children’s voices and children’s agency when, for instance, they are told to write letters to authors in school, and she addresses the difficulties of finding historical examples of children’s agency. However, such difficulties might also be an encouragement to increase and refine searches and develop new methods of critical analysis.</p>
<p>Three key areas highlight children’s agency in relation to fiction: the degree of agency granted to fictional child characters, the attribution of agency to the implied child reader, and how the conditions of a book’s production and distribution grant or deny children agency. First, children and young people are often main characters in narratives aimed at children and young people, and very often, relationships to peers and adults play an important part in these stories. In this context, key questions could be, How agential are main characters? and What characterizes the relationship between children and peers, children and adults, and the individual and society? The relationship between children and adults plays an important part in Erich Kästner’s <i>Emil und die Detektive</i> (<i>Emil and the Detectives</i>; [1929] 1931). On a train trip to Berlin, Emil is robbed of the money he was supposed to give to his grandmother. In Berlin, a group of boys gathers to help Emil, and they are soon able to find the thief and get him arrested. The boys’ inventiveness, their ability to act independently, and their lack of trust in adult superiority are at the core of the narrative. Adult authority is described as comic, thickheaded, and unjust: <span id="p12" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="12"></span>when Emil’s uncle thinks he should decide what Emil can do with his reward, first Emil and then his outspoken girl cousin speak up and question the uncle’s authority, and Emil gets to influence the way his money is spent.</p>
<p>Second, when adult authors write for an audience of children, this relationship is reflected in the implied author and the implied reader of specific texts (Wall [1991] 1994; Weinreich 2000). Which strategies in the text may grant the implied reader aspects of agency—for example, an active role in the construction of the text’s meaning? Socratic dialogues in many eighteenth-century texts for children engage a child reader in making up his or her own mind, but only within a limited range of possible choices. From the nineteenth century onward, the child reader is more often addressed as an individual who can and should have an influence on his or her own interpretation of a text. In “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” the reader must decide what to think of the emperor, and the nonsensical wordplay of Lewis Carroll’s <i>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</i> (1865; see Carroll 1990) offers a wide variety of interpretative strategies to a reader attempting to make sense of the text. While it is generally quite clear in Astrid Lindgren’s <i>Pippi Långstrump</i> (1945) that the agentic, free, antiauthoritarian child is celebrated, the end of the story makes it possible also to perceive her independence as connected to loneliness and isolation.</p>
<p>Third, in children’s literature’s production, dissemination, and reception, are actual child readers granted agency and addressed as agentic individuals? Which roles do adults inhabit in these processes—for example, as individuals who must protect or challenge children or who should “set children free”? What would each of these roles imply in specific cases? Which possibilities or which limitations of children’s agency are inherent in a new digital book market and digital media such as YouTube and Instagram?</p>
<p>Placing actual children’s agency in a historical perspective, Matthew O. Grenby (2011) traces the ways in which children had an influence on what and how they read in England between 1700 and 1850. Marah Gubar (2009) has drawn attention to the fact that children were also producers and coproducers of texts for children in nineteenth-century England. In a contemporary perspective, quite a few books are now being published with and by young people with high numbers of followers on Instagram and YouTube. In 2014, two fourteen- and fifteen-year-old girls, Laura Arnesen and Marie Wivel, made it to the best-seller list with a book based on their Instagram account. Subsequently, the book was sold to fourteen countries in numbers most authors of children’s literature can only dream of. In fora for fan fiction, children and young people can influence their favorite narratives and have the possibility of getting feedback from readers of all ages.</p>
<p>Discussions of agency are linked to race and gender. Angie Thomas’s <i>The Hate U Give</i> describes the young black protagonist, Starr, and her development after having witnessed her black friend Khalil being shot by the police. Starr and other characters discuss the degree to which a person is, respectively, shaped by given conditions and structures or has an influence on his or her own life and can change such structures. Toward the end of the novel, Starr asks, “What’s the point of having a voice if you’re gonna be silent in those moments you shouldn’t be?” (2017, 248), and when she gains courage to speak at a protest against police violence, she describes her voice as her “biggest weapon” (405). Focusing more on gender, Victoria Flanagan finds girls gaining greater agentic possibilities via digital technology in three contemporary novels that “showcase an incipient trend in YA fiction: the ideological construction of social media as a pro-feminist space that has the capacity to promote and produce agentic forms of feminine identity” (2017, 38).</p>
<p><span id="p13" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="13"></span>A focus on agency provides an alternative to viewing the child as vulnerable and dependent on adult power and protection. At one end of the spectrum, the term recalls the romantic child: free, independent, divine. At another end, the child figure finds herself restricted, defined, denied by her structural predicament. Between the two positions, a range of variations coexist. Literature for young people, and the discussions related to this field, revolve around such ambivalences.</p>

<p class="pf">The chief ambassador for the magic kingdom of childhood is an oversized mouse. One of a few cultural figures recognized by his first name alone, Mickey is such an icon that his ubiquitous smile and welcoming gloved hands have erased much of the strangeness and the history by which a cheerful rodent became a symbol for dreams beyond the Freudian variety of wolf-man nightmares. Insistently invoking imagination as the antidote to reality, the mouse subsumes culturally distinct renditions of animals and children under a generic rubric, the Disney fairy tale, which has all but erased its diverse cultural traces and origins. But the mouse inadvertently tells us something about the history of children and animals—namely, that they are fungible as categories and in their relation to one another. If Mickey defines childhood, he also reminds us of the fact that children and animals define one another as creatures similarly exempt from adult subjectivity, as pairs that contrast “the human” and “the animal,” as companions or as adversaries. For that matter, the further we enter into the Magic Kingdom’s invention of an animal kingdom, the more this strangeness becomes evident: If Mickey is a mouse, and Donald is a duck, and Goofy is a dog, then how can they have Pluto the pet? And for that matter, why do the mouse, the duck, and the dog wear white gloves, leaving only Pluto with paws? <i>Animal</i> is an unstable term, one that simultaneously differs from children and defines them. At the core of that contestation is the key question of <span id="p14" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="14"></span>how, whether, and when beings enter into the forms of subjectivity generally reserved for adulthood and what rights and responsibilities they carry at that threshold.</p>
<p>Etymologically speaking, <i>animal</i> already comprises these tensions. According to the <i>OED</i>, the term goes back to Latin roots that were widely incorporated into the word’s Anglo-Norman, French, Catalan, Spanish, Portuguese, and English variants. The word generically describes a living organism, but it can be used to encompass all living creatures or to distinguish between human beings and all others. In short, the term can be a marker of universal inclusion or of human exception. At the same time, it can also designate versions of human beings—often denigrated as “brutes”—or aspects of human nature, such as “brutality.” In that sense, <i>animal</i> refers to the self, an aspect of the self, and a version of the other when it comes to human beings’ relation to the word in its etymological and cultural forms. <i>Animal</i> functions as both a noun and an adjective. As a noun, it designates ontological and epistemological categories. As an adjective, it unsettles those very categories. Scholars have attempted to coin new terms to specify these differences—for instance, arguing that we separate <i>animality</i> (i.e., traits shared between human beings and animals) from <i>animal</i> as a biological designation (Lundblad 2009), thereby reviving discussions energized by Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s insistence on an “originary animality” that lies at the “foundation of natural right” (Billing 2013, 2).</p>
<p>Any definition of <i>animal</i> thus intervenes into the fraught question of how children map into nature and onto subjectivity. Animals relate to children in scientific ways as objects of study that became increasingly viewed with a scientific as opposed to a religious or spiritual gaze in the early modern period. René Descartes argued that animals were essentially machines whose cries were not reflections of any ethically recognizable pain and who could therefore be vivisected—that is, cut up alive without anesthetics—at the scientist’s will. Subject to the scientific gaze of the Enlightenment, animals became objects of scientific study and classification, being fitted into orderly systems by naturalists such as the Comte de Buffon, Thomas Jefferson, and the Darwins (Erasmus and Charles). Yet in <i>We Have Never Been Modern</i> (1993), Bruno Latour argues that the distinction between science and other modes of inquiry was always incomplete and that our current investment in interdisciplinarity masks the long-term entanglements of modern thought. That might be one way of making sense of the fact that animals populated the Shakespearean stage and early modern entertainment culture (Boehrer 2010), that animal breeding (Davidson 2009) and pet keeping (Ritvo 1986) emerged alongside scientific inquiry. Moreover, it is important to remember that scientific engagements with animals always ran parallel to narrative and cultural accounts, extending from Aesop to the medieval beast fable but also occurring in Ovid’s account of metamorphoses and the fairy tales’ portrayal of talking animals who engage in particular with children, such as “Little Red Riding Hood” and other tales that subvert and assert social coming-of-age expectations. These cultural forms are not only Western; as Henry Louis Gates Jr. (1988) demonstrates, the “Signifyin’ Monkey” of Yoruba traditions significantly impacted African American trickster narratives, which in Joel Chandler Harris’s appropriation cast Br’er Rabbit at the center of children’s literature and popular entertainment culture, with Mickey Mouse as a not-so-distant cousin.</p>
<p>Even before Charles Darwin’s account of evolution posited an evolutionary as well as emotional relationship to animals, children could be likened developmentally to animals, whose nominal limitations they surpassed as they grew up. In his <i>Some Thoughts concerning Education</i>, John Locke responded to a friend’s query <span id="p15" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="15"></span>regarding the proper rearing of his son. Locke lamented that there were no books fit for children aside from <i>Aesop’s Fables</i>. Making fables the basis for children’s introduction to literature became a vogue in response to his writing—which was more widely circulated in the American colonies than his <i>Two Treatises of Government</i>. Inaugurating the field of children’s literature, animals took on a primary role for the education of children into citizens. Arguing that children who were cruel to animals learned to be despots, Locke reasoned that kindness to animals inculcated the characteristics and virtues necessary for good citizenship. This call for good citizenship resonated in subsequent portrayals of animals, ranging from the rejection of cruelty in Victorian novels (Kreilkamp 2005) to the outright activism of books such as Anna Sewell’s <i>Black Beauty</i> (1877) that insisted animal welfare needed to be part of civic society.</p>
<p>The project of <i>Black Beauty</i> should give us pause: modeled after Harriet Beecher Stowe’s abolitionist work <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i> (1852) as well as the early nineteenth-century didactic tales F. J. Harvey Darton ([1932, 1958] 1970) identifies, Sewell’s novel aspired to work toward animal liberation in the way that Stowe had worked for abolition. The facile parallel between animals and slaves reminds us of the ways in which the denigration of human beings has often taken the form of likening racialized others to animals and of infantilizing them in the process. Strangely, such animalized human beings inhabit a childlike position that often relies on children for its amelioration while, in the process, affirming those children’s civic engagement and ability to enter into the requirements of citizenship. The characters with which we began are a reminder of that history as well: black faces and white gloves were the hallmarks of minstrel shows, which portrayed nonwhites as childlike and animalistic. In Mickey Mouse and the performance culture from which early cartoons sprang (Sammond 2015), we see echoes of this racial, animal, children’s history carried into our own present moment.</p>
<p>The current scholarly field of so-called animal studies originated with Jacques Derrida’s late writings and his proposition that we engage with <i>animaux</i>, the French plural for animals, which he punningly refashioned as “ani-mots”—that is, animal words that gain significance in their relation to one another (2008, 415). That sense of relation has been at the core of much work in the larger field of animal—or, we might say, human-animal—studies. A key figure, Donna Haraway, emphasizes that relationship when she talks about “companion species” (2003, 6). The term for her indicates not only that human beings and animals have a relation to one another but that—like Lyra and her dæmon in Philip Pullman’s <i>His Dark Materials</i> trilogy (1995–2000)—we cannot think about the one without acknowledging the imbrications of the other.</p>
<p>How those connections are worked out, what formative elements they carry, and how they shape senses of being are questions that Kathryn Bond Stockton usefully takes up in relationship to children. Arguing that both children and animals are categorized as “other,” she asserts that for queer children in particular, the relationship to animals offers a form of “growing sideways” instead of growing up (2009, 53). By that, she means that animals offer an alternative form of being for queer children than that of normative, gendered adulthood and that the relationships children develop with animals make it possible to conceptualize modes of relating other than those of the heteronormative family and the society that takes such heteronormativity for its premise.</p>
<p>Even within the framework of the heteronormative family, however, there is room for growing sideways into animals instead of adults. Kenneth Kidd reads Maurice Sendak’s <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i> (1963) as a <span id="p16" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="16"></span>“bedtime-story version of Freud’s Wolf Man case history of 1918, an updated and upbeat dream of the wolf boy” (Kidd 2011c, 106). Though “a queer interpretation of Sendak’s work has yet to emerge,” Max “may well be . . . queer to some degree—hard to manage, independent, animal-identified” (125). Sendak’s “feral tale” (106) also participates in a long and still-growing lineage of publications: feral children in general and wolf-boys in particular captured Daniel Defoe’s imagination when “Peter the Wild Boy” became a cause célèbre in the early eighteenth century (Newton 2002), one that Defoe examined in his pamphlet <i>Mere Nature Delineated</i> (1726). More recently, Marina Warner’s <i>Managing Monsters</i> (1994) as well as Emily Hughes’s <i>Wild</i> (2013) continue to explore the intersection between children and animals as children navigate their relation to nature, including their own.</p>
<p>The fluidity between children and animals is particularly pronounced in narratives that imagine forms of blended embodiment and of metamorphosis, such as the many versions of the <i>Little Mermaid</i>, ranging from Hans Christian Andersen’s tale, to the Disney movie, to the story’s cross-cultural adaptations. Anna Katrina Gutierrez traces the tale through its “glocal” reinterpretations to the films of Hayao Miyazaki. In <i>Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea</i> (2008), Miyazaki blends Hans Christian Andersen’s tale with “Urashima Taro” (a story first recorded in the eighth century CE). Miyazaki weaves an “interspecies romance” that signifies “the desire of nature and humanity to be united” (Gutierrez 2017, 169) but also reverses the trajectory from the natural to the human and emphasizes children’s needs for communion with the animal and natural realm.</p>
<p>As Akira Lippit (2000) has indicated, animation in particular and the technologization of animals in general confront us with an increasingly difficult way of relating to animals—and, I might add, to children. As John Berger (1980) has cautioned, the loss of our direct gaze distorts both the animal and the sense of subject formation, or, as Steve Baker claims more polemically, “the basic procedure of disnification is to render it [the animal] stupid by rendering it visual” (1993, 141). For better and for worse, children’s relationship to animals—and vice versa—is a cultural construct that is as fungible as it is essential to the social formations it reflects and creates.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="pf">A curiously slippery word, <i>archive</i> is both singular and plural, noun and verb (<i>OED</i>). It can refer to the place where material is stored (such as a rare books library) and to the material itself (<i>OED</i>). The etymological evolution of <i>archive</i> through its Greek roots—<i>arkheia</i> (public records) and <i>arkhe</i> (government)—provides a map of the word’s lexical tensions. In the seventeenth century, when <i>archive</i> first came into use, it was a place where (public) records were kept. As other forms of the root mean “beginnings”—as in <i>archeology</i> and <i>architecture</i>—the idea of a foundation also lingers. By way of contrast, the <i>OED</i> defines <i>library</i> as “a place set apart to contain books for reading, study, or reference.” Although a library may house an archive, it is only in an archive that it is possible to search for origin stories. The verb form, <i>to archive</i>, does not appear until the twentieth-century.</p>
<p>Because archives are as secure and well protected as bank vaults, analogous questions about the value of content and access arise: What is worth saving? What material is secured to ensure its protection? And what is stored in order to hide and keep from circulation? Once access to an archive is gained, how is relevant material retrieved and how is it interpreted? As material archives—books, typed and handwritten drafts, annotated manuscripts, and the like—move to digital formats, what are the consequences for storage if the need diminishes for climate-controlled buildings? Do shifts to digital formats also fundamentally alter the kinds of research traditionally done in material archives? Will “archival research” morph into “data mining”?</p>
<p>To indicate how <i>archive</i> illuminates tensions that circulate around access, preservation, and interpretation of sources and the curious position of children and their literatures, consider a hypothetical scholar going online to the British Library “Archives and Manuscripts” catalog to search for items in the Edward James (Ted) Hughes Archive from among the “465 folders, 11 oversize items (5 in melinex enclosures), 4 oversize volumes, 2 boxes and 1 envelope” listed on the website (Edward James Hughes Papers). Melinex, by the way, is a kind of nonreactive polyester film used to protect fragile manuscripts and works on paper from disintegrating. The reader would have to turn up, in person, with the required authorization and identification to collect selected items—one at a time—from the Manuscripts Reading Room on the second floor of the British Library and view them at a designated desk under close surveillance by the librarians. No photographs allowed. And no pens.</p>
<p>Hughes—poet laureate of the UK between 1984 and his death in 1998—wrote by hand, with a fountain pen, on paper. Drafting his own works in progress, he used the blank backs of typed poems and stories by children submitted to the W. H. Smith Young Writers’ Competition (formerly the <i>Daily Mirror</i> Children’s Literary Competition); he served as a judge for over thirty years. There is something shockingly intimate about reading a Ted Hughes poem on one side of a page and a child’s poem on the other—the latter surviving only because of its association with Hughes. Texts both for and by children are usually not so lucky.</p>
<p>Materials related to children’s literature and culture are ephemeral almost by definition. Books, toys, and games used by real children quickly become torn, worn, and damaged. Once outgrown, childhood playthings <span id="p18" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="18"></span>are typically discarded. Yet as Kenneth Kidd suggests, the impulse to preserve materials persists, motivated perhaps by “a desire to return to childhood experience as much as by the desire to discover something new” (Kidd 2011a, 17). And sometimes miracles happen.</p>
<p>In 1986, Justin Schiller, a New York–based specialist dealing in antiquarian children’s books, was asked to evaluate the estate of Elisabeth Ball of Muncie, Indiana. There, stored in a shoebox, he found what is now the Jane Johnson Manuscript Nursery Library: 438 pieces of instructional materials—alphabet cards, lesson cards, and story cards—handmade by Johnson, probably between 1738 and 1748, to teach her own young children to read. The cards are historically important, as their mid-eighteenth-century creation date provides tangible evidence of a mother crafting her own pedagogical tools. Though John Locke is typically credited with explaining, in <i>Some Thoughts concerning Education</i>, that children should be “cozened into a Knowledge of the Letters” ([1693] 1989, 224), Julia Briggs (2005) suggests that the credit is misplaced: mothers were already making those materials, and Locke was just reporting on established maternal practices. The Jane Johnson Manuscript Nursery Library, now protected in the Lilly Library in Indiana, stands as testimony to those maternal cultural practices. The survival of the material also testifies to the fact that for 250 years, there were people who thought that those tiny cards—all 438, remember, fit in one shoebox—were valuable enough to keep.</p>
<p>Children’s literature and material culture potentially provide a window into social, cultural and literary histories in that they stand as something of a universal common ground: all adults have been children. But what survives depends on what is deemed important enough to preserve. The Hans Christian Andersen House and Museum, established in 1908 in Odense, Denmark, has a dedicated mandate to honor one of the country’s most internationally famous authors, and the museum stands as iconic testimony to the cultural importance of a national hero. By way of contrast, the library that serves the Institut für Jugendbuchforschung (Department for Children’s and Young Adult Literature Research), housed in Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany, and founded in 1963, has a broader cultural mandate: the study of German children’s literature and culture in their international context. The personal children’s book collection of philosopher Walter Benjamin (1892–1940) is there. As Ian Grosvenor explains, Benjamin (who wrote movingly about the cultural value of his own children’s books) speaks directly to the value of archives by capturing “the performative nature of ‘remembering’ and the relationship with traces of the past that remain in the present” (Grosvenor 2002, 111). The fact that scholars have access at all to archives containing historical collections of children’s books, games, and toys is a kind of miracle. Because the material was intended for use, not posterity, it was not usually regarded as valuable or collectable. That’s why research in studies in children’s literature is largely thanks to the prescience of mid-twentieth-century collectors. Among the most well known are Fernand Renier (1905–1988) and Anne Renier (1911?–1988), who donated their collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; Iona Opie (1923–2017) and Peter Opie (1918–1982), who sold their library to the Bodleian in Oxford; Lloyd Cotsen (1929–2017), who gave his collection to Princeton; Edgar Osborne (d. 1978), who donated his to the Toronto Public Library; and Ruth Baldwin (1918–1990), who gave hers to the University of Florida. And with the increasing recognition of the value of children’s material culture in the context of cultural heritage (unmarked as being for children), institutions such as Seven Stories: The National Centre for Children’s Books, in Newcastle, England, established in 1996 by Elizabeth Hammill <span id="p19" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="19"></span>and Mary Briggs, have started to take an active role in preserving material that would otherwise have disappeared. As Seven Stories states on its website, the center sees itself as the “protector” of the British “literary heritage for children.” To that end, it has become home to the archives of some of Britain’s most important authors and illustrators, including John Agard, David Almond, Aidan Chambers, Grace Nichols, and Michael Morpurgo.</p>
<p>Archives, however, are not just places that protect our cultural histories. They are also hiding places for materials we would rather forget. Because access is restricted, it is possible to remove material from public circulation and bury it. A case in point is “Ten Little Niggers” (1875), which began as a hugely popular song and flourished in many versions, including stand-alone picture books and as the original title for Agatha Christie’s <i>And Then There Were None</i> (1939). The enduring popularity of the song now reads as emblematic of racist tropes we would rather forget. Yet only through the work of scholars—such as Wulf Schmidt-Wullfen’s <i>Ten Little Niggers: Racial Discrimination in Children’s Books</i> (2012)—is it possible to expose the dark corners of the archives in which those books have been hidden and to demonstrate the damage caused when they were in circulation.</p>
<p>Once materials—books, toys, games, manuscripts—make their way into protected archives, the people who manage to access them try to make those carefully stored things speak. That requires the skill of a good detective: finely tuned instincts, dogged determination to pay close attention to all clues, and openness to occasional moments of chance illumination. In anglophone children’s literature, the most well-known story about archival research is E. L. Konigsburg’s <i>From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler</i> (1967), about two children who decide to run away from home to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The story is partly about proving the authenticity of one of the museum’s recent acquisitions, a statue said to be by Michelangelo. The proof is hidden in one of the “mixed-up” files stored in a wall of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler’s filing cabinets (soon to need a footnote of their own). The children are tasked with discovering the “search term” to find the file that will resolve the mystery. Only when one uses the dismissive term <i>boloney</i> does the other remember that their earlier research had informed them that the statue had been purchased in Bologna. The answer to the mystery was in the <i>B</i> files: a single sheet with Michelangelo’s handwriting on one side (they’d seen examples) and his drawing of the statue on the other. As Kenneth Kidd, Lucy Pearson, and Sarah Pyke (2016) point out in their essay on archives, the “serendipity” of the baloney-Bologna connection provided the key. Archival scholarship requires the two elements foregrounded in the book: active research and chance.</p>
<p>Historically, material archives—books, toys, and games—have required designated storage space. As the production of texts change, so do the storage requirements, especially of papers by children’s authors successful enough to be saved for posterity. From the late 1980s, authors began migrating from paper to digital formats, diminishing the chance of ever again seeing multiple drafts or drafts on the blank backs of poems written by children. Changing technologies may also curtail access even to saved material. Manuscripts composed on, say, an Apple II and stored on floppy disks are no longer readable unless the machine on which they were composed is preserved and maintained. Digitally connected archives also suddenly make it possible to make previously impossible links. The Study Platform on Interlocking Nationalisms (SPIN), for example, established in 2008 as a collaborative enterprise between the University of Amsterdam and the Huizinga Institute under the leadership <span id="p20" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="20"></span>of Joep Leerssen, is designed, as explained on the website, to “chart the cultural and historical root systems of European nationalisms” (<a class="url" href="http://spinnet.eu">http://spinnet.eu</a>). What the site suddenly opens is the possibility of mapping the transmission of political and cultural trends across time and place.</p>
<p>Recent innovations such as “born-digital” texts and “cloud storage” present new problems. If the material has no physical presence, it no longer needs a physical storage space. But then who owns the material? Who manages the copyright? As we move into the future, we recalibrate our readings of the past.</p>

<p class="pf">The dominant modern meaning of <i>audience</i> refers to the viewers of an entertainment or readers of a book. According to the <i>OED</i>, such usages date to before 1387 (for a performance) and to 1760 (for a book or writer). Other early meanings including “the range or sphere of hearing,” or being within a person’s hearing, date to before 1393. Derived from the Latin <i>aud</i><span class="dcrit-i">ī</span><i>re</i>, “to hear,” the term has a special resonance for children’s literature because the youngest children are not readers but auditors of literature, truly an audience. Indeed, the broad term <i>audience</i> better captures the many ways in which children consume literature—and other aspects of culture—than does <i>reader</i>, the term generally preferred in literary criticism.</p>
<p>Raymond Williams (1976, 1983b) did not include <i>audience</i> in his <i>Keywords</i>. The term does receive an entry in <i>New Keywords</i>, edited by Tony Bennett, Lawrence Grossberg, and Meaghan Morris (2005): David Morley’s account focuses almost entirely on the audience for mass media, especially addressing the extent to which such an audience is passively susceptible to or actively shapes the messages received. A popular approach in cultural criticism has been to assume that children lack agency and to castigate the media, arguing that our children must be protected from its effects. Since at least 1965, when the librarian Frances Clarke Sayers fired a salvo (Sayers and Weisenberg 1965)—and perhaps even from 1938, when Anne Carroll Moore expressed her concern—critics have deplored how reductive and <span id="p21" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="21"></span>saccharine Disney products are. Yet some cultural critics, such as Ellen Seiter (1993) and Gerard Jones (2002), highlight ways in which children respond actively, in an ongoing process of negotiation, perhaps reshaping what they see on television or using comic books to mitigate anxieties. Indeed, an increasing literature attends to media and material culture (Tobin 2004), such as dolls (Bernstein 2011b), including the numerous uses of Barbie—even if the most radical uses (Barbie as dildo) are often associated with adults (Rand 1995).</p>
<p>As for children’s literature, the concept of audience has a special salience, for this literature is not by children, as the possessive might imply, but rather read by or to them: it is defined by its audience. Yet how exactly audience delimits children’s literature is subject to debate. Scholars disagree as to whether it is defined by being intended for children (Nodelman 2008) or is simply literature that they read (Lerer 2008). Does a book appropriated by children, such as <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> (Defoe 1719), count? Do books that a publisher markets for children count, even if an author didn’t have such an audience in mind while writing? Scholars also disagree about whether to focus more on the book or the child in their judgments, but even the book people can’t altogether forget the target audience: “Naturally a knowledge of and sympathy with children is . . . vital,” notes Brian Alderson in “The Irrelevance of Children to the Children’s Book Reviewer” (quoted in Hunt 1991).</p>
<p>More broadly, the study of children’s literature raises intriguing theoretical questions that are too often missed by mainstream literary theorists, who generally ignore children’s literature. However well Stanley Fish’s (1980) concept of an “interpretive community” might work for adult readers, for instance, how does one define such a community for children? How do they find meaning in a text? Can they find it without adult mentoring? Does their interpretive community necessarily include adults? Children’s literature also points to the multiplicity of address of literature, given that no other literature so thoroughly excludes the intended audience from the various aspects of formal production and distribution. Very few young people have written, edited, published, or sold books. And relatively few children directly buy them; even if a smaller proportion of children’s book sales are now to libraries than was the case in the 1960s, librarians, teachers, and other adults have continued to be the primary buyers (Stevenson 1997). The result, as Zohar Shavit (1986) and others have noted, is that children’s literature has at least a double address: the children who are the ostensible audience and the adults whose decisions make it available.</p>
<p>Given that the decision-makers are not part of the ostensible audience, the nature of children’s literature very much depends on how adults construct childhood and children. Indeed, Jacqueline Rose (1984) argues that it is impossible for adults truly to know children; rather, they are always constructing them. If adults construct children as beings to be molded for the future, then children’s literature may be conceived as an important part of this molding—and therefore as necessarily didactic and needing to be monitored or censored, as Sarah Trimmer was systematically doing as long ago as 1802 (<i>The Guardian of Education</i> [1802–6]). Others, following a Romantic construction of childhood, feel that children’s literature should provide wings for the imagination—a kind of projection onto the child that may also be freeing. Indeed, we should not lose sight of the fact that children are not just passive; they can be active agents too, constructing what they read—and themselves. For children are also real. A focus on the duality of the audience may, in fact, occlude its multiplicities, masking the heterogeneity of children. Children differ, for one thing, by age. Indeed, when does childhood end? Does one exclude humans <span id="p22" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="22"></span>over the age of perhaps twelve, or does one include young adults, a group whose upper age limit keeps rising? Does one include a new category of new adults who are primarily in their twenties? Children also differ by gender, race, class, abledness, religion, and nationality. Focus on “the child” as audience too often misses the real differences among children.</p>
<p>Some scholars observe the reading or viewing processes of actual children or examine their self-reports or perhaps how they deface books (Arizpe, Colomer, and Martínez-Roldán 2014; Benton [1995] 2005; Blackford 2004; Gubar 2011; Sánchez-Eppler 2011b; Schwebel 2016). The internet has enabled significant access to responses by the young, who can create fan fiction, art, videos, blogs, reviews, and more—no longer just “passively swallow[ing] the narratives adult institutions allow them” but “talk[ing] back” and even “developing aesthetic forms . . . to suit themselves” (Tosenberger 2014). Scholars such as Catherine Tosenberger have sampled fan responses to the Harry Potter series (more than eighty thousand items of fan fiction on <a class="url" href="http://www.fanfiction.net">fanfiction.net</a> alone) and the Twilight series (more than thirty thousand), perhaps noting shifts in romantic pairings and eroticism (Morey 2012; Day 2014).</p>
<p>Other scholars study the kinds of address created within a work, the narratee or the implied reader (Wall [1991] 1994). Some look at the implied reader cross-culturally, noting, for instance, how differently various cultures tolerate showing depictions of nudity to children (Nikolajeva 2011) or how translators of <i>Pinocchio</i> (Collodi [1883] 1996) have adapted it to varying norms regarding what children should and can read or view, if indeed children are the target audience (O’Sullivan 2005). Even picture books may target adults more than children—but differently in different cultures. The parodic American picture book <i>Go the Fuck to Sleep</i> (Mansbach 2011), which has been translated into more than thirty languages, would seem to target adults across cultures. But works that more ambiguously target both adults and children are less likely to translate across cultures and languages. These include books by the Danish writer Oskar K (Ole Dalgaard) about aborted fetuses or a children’s undertaker and the Norwegian Gro Dahle’s picture books on problems with divorce (see Ommundsen 2015) or on a child watching pornography. It’s suggestive that only about half of the picture books by the eminent German illustrator Wolf Erlbruch have been translated into English. One book that includes cannibalism of a child has, significantly, not (Paul 2011).</p>
<p>In some cultures, the implied reader may be a child who is strongly in need of protection and instruction, whether moral or civic, directly or allegorically (e.g., Farquhar 1999; Ho 1997; Douglas and Malti-Douglas 1999). In postwar France, protectionist concerns about lying and disrespect for authority led to a reluctance to publish foreign imports and the drastic cutting of Astrid Lindgren’s Pippi Longstocking trilogy (1945–48; Heywood 2015). In many countries in the postwar era, adults responded to the spread of American superhero and crime comic books with negative sanctions or countervailing initiatives (Jensen 2017; Lent 1999, 2009). More recently, in China, scholars may debate the need for mere enjoyment (Nelson and Morris [2014] 2016) or perhaps associate the Harry Potter books with the increasing childhood agency of a new generation, even as the books mediate between such individualism and the communal values of older generations (Gupta and Xiao 2009).</p>
<p>In any case, what we now consider to be children’s literature arose through market segmentation. Early literature in the West—mystery plays, ballads, folk tales, sermons—embraced children as part of its audience. <span id="p23" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="23"></span>Even later, literature for children long overlapped with that for the laboring and, later, working classes: children read chapbooks, evangelical tracts, and dime novels. What is often considered children’s literature per se—an imaginative literature directly targeting the young—is generally seen as arising in the eighteenth century, along with the middle class, whether or not one dates the first anglophone work precisely to 1744 with <i>A Little Pretty Pocket-Book</i>, published by John Newbery. For most of the nineteenth century, nevertheless, cultural gatekeepers often assumed they should publish nothing “that could not be read aloud in the family circle,” to quote an editor of <i>Harper’s Monthly</i> in the 1890s (Mott 1938): they assumed that the young would be part of a general readership. And works that ostensibly targeted children, which subsequent readers have classified as children’s literature, were often read by adults as well—not just in the company of children, as now with a bedtime story, but independently (Clark 2003).</p>
<p>About the turn of the twentieth century, the anglophone canons of taste changed. As the cultural gatekeepers shifted in the US from the likes of magazine editors to the professoriate, and Herman Melville’s star, for one, ascended, only works (especially those by white men) seen as targeting an adult audience came to be seen as worthy of the highest approbation. Children’s literature was thus inferior. If in 1893 “The Best American Books,” published in the literary journal <i>The Critic</i>, included <i>Little Women</i> (Alcott [1868–69] 2004) and <i>Little Lord Fauntleroy</i> (Burnett [1886] 2009) among its top forty, twentieth-century lists of important books rarely included works we now classify as for children.</p>
<p>Nor did the academy provide a friendly audience for children’s literature. Now, however, as academic departments devote courses and programs to this literature, as some books such as the Harry Potter series have reached a crossover audience, as publishers seem to welcome such crossovers (Beckett 2009a; Falconer 2009), and indeed, as <i>Keywords for Children’s Literature</i> goes into a second edition, change is afoot.</p>

<p class="pf">According to the <i>OED</i>, the first instance of the word <i>authenticity</i> was in 1716, in letters to Dr. Richard Bentley regarding a translation of the New Testament (cited in McDonald 2016, 226). Variations of the word <i>authenticity</i>, however, appear earlier: “<i>autenticitat</i> (probably 1343)” and “French <i>authenticité</i> (1557).” Definitions of <i>authenticity</i> include “the fact or quality of being true or in accordance with fact; veracity; correctness”; “of undisputed origin and not a copy; genuine”; “made or done in the traditional or original way, or in a way that faithfully resembles an original”; and “based on facts; accurate or reliable” (<i>OED</i>).</p>
<p>Moving from religious to philosophical meanings, Kernis and Goldman claim that two aspects of “authentic functioning” are “people’s (1) self-understanding” and “(2) openness to objectively recognizing their ontological realities (e.g., evaluating their desirable and undesirable self-aspects)” (2006, 284). Sartre agrees: “Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself” ([1946] 2004, 282). In contrast, Heidegger defines <i>inauthenticity</i> as “a state in which life, stripped of purpose and responsibility, is depersonalized and dehumanized” (<i>Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy</i>).</p>
<p>Being authentic to oneself can collide with one’s writing being authentic to a culture. The tension between the two derives from the fact that, though one’s own story may be authentic to oneself, cultures are not monolithic. As a result, one’s own story may be perceived as inauthentic to some members of that culture. Claims to authenticity—and accusations of inauthenticity—in children’s literature emerge from the intimate entanglements of personal, cultural, and political histories. For example, in Europe, shifting responses to immigration patterns produce evolving definitions of who can be “European,” particularly in relation to those perceived as ethnic “others” (Chin 2017, 2); White Europeans’ perceptions of immigrants’ assimilability impact the provision of and barriers to social services, acceptance, mobility, and so on, which then alter the materials conditions in which immigrants live. In a Chinese context, Minjie Chen evaluates how youth literature might represent—and misrepresent—certain aspects of Sino-Japanese histories, especially as they relate to war, violence, and power. While reading what we now call <i>diverse literature</i> may offer “the opportunity to experience the world through the written word,” these delights may be eclipsed by “opposition, backlash, and debates,” even raising questions as to diverse literature’s “continued existence” (Harris 2006a, 108).</p>
<p>Readers assume that insiders write authentic stories, thus being faithful to themselves and to the expressions of themselves through text. One marker of “cultural authenticity” is that it is evident the writer “knows what’s going on” (Bishop 2003, 29). Similarly, Jacqueline Woodson writes that “as a black person, it is easy to tell who has and who has not been inside ‘my house’” (2003, 45). Others contend that “anybody can write about anything—if they’re good enough . . . defining authenticity on some exclusionary basis won’t change a thing” (Rochman 2003, 108). Non-Black writers such as Ezra Jack Keats have made what Michelle H. Martin calls “substantial contributions” to the body of Black children’s literature; Keats’s depiction of an “ordinary black boy . . . played such an instrumental part in the normalization of blackness in children’s literature” that it merits inclusion in her book, <i>Brown Gold: Milestones</i> <span id="p25" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="25"></span><i>of African-American Children’s Picture Books, 1845–2002</i> (2004). These essays and books remain relevant as debates continue about the creation, marketing, and use of diverse literature, particularly but not only regarding the ways in which this literature is authentic.</p>
<p>Multicultural publishing data from the Cooperative Children’s Book Center (CCBC, School of Education, University of Wisconsin–Madison) relay the diversity but not the authenticity or quality of American children’s literature. The statistics include all books, regardless of quality, authorship, and authenticity, so long as a primary or secondary character is Indigenous or a person of color. Therefore, it is likely that the actual number of high-quality authentic texts is smaller than the reported 23 percent diverse total of all children’s books published in 2018, 25 percent of all in 2017, 22 percent of all in 2016, and 15 percent of all in 2015. The American publishing industry’s data make up the bulk of the CCBC’s data; breaking down the numbers by countries of origin hardly changes the statistics. In the UK, the “Reflecting Realities” survey revealed that only 4 percent of children’s books published in 2017 contained BAME (Black and minority ethnic) characters; only 1 percent had BAME main characters (Centre for Literacy in Primary Education 2018). While this report addressed genres, topics, and reading levels, it did not define what would make “authentic” children’s literature but did comment that more “meaningful and accurate” portrayals are needed.</p>
<p>The shelves of libraries and bookstores remain full of children’s books that present themselves as culturally authentic and yet distort, misrepresent, or caricature their subjects. <i>The Story of Little Black Sambo</i> (Bannerman 1899) and <i>Five Chinese Brothers</i> (Bishop 1938), both written and illustrated by white people, remain popular even as they contain egregious stereotypes; multiple authors and illustrators have created retellings with new art (Lester 1996; Mahy 1990; Tucker 2003). Similarly, the inauthenticity of the picture book <i>Tikki Tikki Tembo</i> (Mosel 1968) can be traced directly to the creator’s confusion about the story’s country of origin. In “Rethinking Tikki Tikki Tembo,” Grace Lin describes how, though the story originated in Japan, Arlene Mosel claimed that the story was based on a Chinese folktale. Despite claims to Chineseness, illustrator Blair Lent drew the characters as wearing kimonos and getas, both traditionally Japanese. In a related blog post, “The Problem with Celebrating Rikki Tikki Tembo,” Lin also writes, “It took a non-Chinese story and pretended that it was old and authentic, added bogus traditions and words; and, in doing so, misrepresents Chinese culture.” The danger of such sloppy “authenticity” is that it perpetuates the idea that two distinct Asian cultures and stories may be collapsed as one and the same. Although, as Junko Yokota writes, “eliminating books that are not culturally authentic from library collections and classroom use is paramount” (2009, 16), <i>Tikki Tikki Tembo</i> remains popular. It is a number-one best seller on Amazon with 4.7 out of 5.0 stars, and in early 2017, Hennepin County Library—Minnesota’s largest public library system—reported that it was the highest-circulating picture book, suggesting that readers either are not aware of or may not care about its many inauthenticities.</p>
<p>Language is a frequent site of struggle between what is authentic and what is creative license. The popular picture book series <i>Skippyjon Jones</i> (Schachner 2003) employs what some critics have described as “Splanglish” or “Mock Spanish” (Slapin 2013; Martínez-Roldán 2013). Drawing on popular and negative Mexican stereotypes such as Speedy Gonzalez, the Taco Bell Chihuahua, and Frito Bandito, the protagonist adds &#8211;<i>ito</i> to the ends of words to make them “sound” Spanish. In 2016, advance praise for E. E. Charlton-Trujillo’s young adult novel <i>When We Was Fierce</i> raised red flags regarding dialect <span id="p26" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="26"></span>among some readers. As K. T. Horning (2016) writes, “African-American Vernacular English is not ‘broken English’ . . . you can’t just ‘make it up.’” The novel’s “constructed Ebonics” was “inconsistent,” according to Jennifer Baker (2016), and Edith Campbell (2016) asked, “Who makes up language when portraying real people living in a contemporary society?” Horning, Baker, and Campbell—as insiders in particular ways (Horning, who is white, has a background in linguistics, and Baker and Campbell are both Black)—had the “reader’s sense of truth” that Dana L. Fox and Kathy G. Short claim, “particularly when the reader is an insider” (2003, 5). However, some reviewers (who are mostly white women; see Low 2016) had given the book starred reviews, with Kirkus (2016) claiming that the book employed “Shakespearean word usage.”</p>
<p>False claims to authenticity highlight the risk of essentializing a cultural identity (by defining it too narrowly) and the problem of an outsider misrepresenting a particular community. In addressing whether one has to be of a particular background in order to write an authentic text, <i>The Education of Little Tree</i> (1976) is an example of a text that was accepted—and widely celebrated—as an authentic memoir of a Cherokee man, but it was soon revealed that the author was a white supremacist who lied about his origins (Gates 2003). Forty years later, John Smelcer’s claims to Native identity were similarly challenged after his book <i>Stealing Indians</i> (2016) was announced as a finalist for PEN Center USA’s Literary Award in the young adult category. The <i>Huffington Post</i> reported, “For years, Smelcer’s been an object of suspicion within Native circles, where authors including Sherman Alexie and Terese Mailhot, as well as scholar Debbie Reese, have raised questions about his Native heritage and his credentials, and critiqued his books as misrepresentations of history and Native cultures” (Fallon 2017). The revelation caused PEN Center USA to withdraw <i>Stealing Indians</i> as a finalist (Reese 2017).</p>
<p>Questions regarding the relationships between literary merit and authenticity are worth asking. Gates contends that “our literary judgments . . . remain hostage to the ideology of authenticity” (2003, 135), concluding that while our social identities do matter, who we are and what we wish to or are able to write is not a relation “of fixed determinism” (142). The fear is that this kind of “policing the boundaries” (138) serves only to “[lock] us into smaller and tighter boxes” (Rochman 2003, 107). However, one must also remember the context: Native American stories have been appropriated (and people and land stolen) for centuries, and the majority of youth literature depicting Native people is not written by Native people. As Reese (2018) observes, because the majority of 2016 and 2017 publications by “Big Five” publishers were not written by Native people, “in one explicit or subtle way or another, they fail to provide Native children with mirrors.” On the <i>American Indians in Children’s Literature</i> blog, Reese has carefully vetted hundreds of books that demonstrate that many of the non-Native-authored and -illustrated texts remain deeply problematic. Can such a body of literature be “authentic”? Perhaps not if “an inside perspective is more likely to give an authentic view of what members of the cultural group believe to be true about themselves, whereas an outside perspective gives the view of how others see the particular group’s beliefs and behaviors” (Yokota 1993, 158–59).</p>
<p>What one believes or perceives to be authentic and what is actually authentic is at odds and raises the question of who decides. In her “Danger of a Single Story” (2009) TED Talk, Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie shares that an American professor once told her that her story was not “authentically African,” as if there exists something that is essentially African and <span id="p27" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="27"></span>that he could be the judge. Similarly, Cynthia Leitich Smith’s editors initially refused her <i>Jingle Dancer</i> (2000) manuscript because they said no one would believe that a Native woman could be a lawyer (Smith was a lawyer before she started writing for youth). The industry continues to rely on “single stories,” thus painting cultures and experiences as though they are monolithic and unvaried. Collectively, children’s books tend to tell the same kind of story—for example, when black people are most often depicted in slave narratives or when Jewish narratives are set during and in the immediate aftermath of the Holocaust, and anything outside those narrow parameters may be deemed both unbelievable and inauthentic.</p>
<p>The hashtag #OwnVoices has been used to identify “kidlit about diverse characters written by authors from that same diverse group” (Duyvis 2015). Created by author and blogger Corinne Duyvis in 2015, #OwnVoices has taken on a life of its own, becoming “shorthand for a necessary concept.” In 2017, Duyvis tweeted about how #OwnVoices had gotten “complicated and messy” (2017), similar to how authors of the essays in <i>Stories Matter</i> wrote about the complexities around texts such as the fabricated memoir <i>The Education of Little Tree</i>. In “Continuing Dilemmas, Debates, and Delights in Multicultural Literature,” Violet Harris writes, “Questions about authenticity, insider/outsider views, and authorial freedom remain unresolved” (2006a, 116). Indeed, they do.</p>

<p class="pf"><i>Body</i> is a noun, though it was a verb: “To give form, shape, or physical presence to; to embody. Now chiefly literary or poet” (<i>OED</i>). The <i>OED</i> gives five definitions for the noun: the “physical form of a person, animal, or plant”; the “main portion, the trunk”; “a person”; “a collective mass”; and “substance, matter, a portion of matter.” Then the <i>OED</i> traces the etymology of the word back to “Old High German <i>botah</i>: body, corpse, trunk (of the body).” Additionally, the <i>OED</i> finds that “the sense development has been influenced by association with classical Latin corpus,” which leads to <i>body</i> in the sense of a body of literature, or “a compendium of writings on a subject, textbook (e.g. <i>corpus i</i><span class="dcrit-i">ū</span><i>ris</i> law textbook).” The <i>OED</i>’s five core definitions all emphasize physicality and dominance, the concrete and the aggregate, the literal and the central or prevailing. These definitions highlight two key debates in the field of children’s literature and culture: the way children’s literature represents the physical body of the child and how we understand the body of texts we call children’s literature. Both debates have to do with the normative, an association that can be traced back to the <i>OED</i>’s emphasis on “the main portion” and “the collective mass,” and both debates, accordingly, swirl around questions of inclusion and exclusion.</p>
<p>Arguably, the two most explicit sites of children’s literature’s engagement with the physical body are fairy tales, with their emphasis on sex and violence, and YA fiction, with its focus on sexual maturation, orientation, <span id="p28" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="28"></span>body size, and physical abuse. Fairy tales and YA also have particular relevance to the canon debate, with some critics going so far as to exclude YA from the canon of children’s literature explicitly (Seibert 2007), while others, in their equation of the canonical with classics and with Golden Age children’s literature, do so implicitly (Lundin 2004; Kidd 2011b). Similarly, the body of tales the editors of <i>The Norton Anthology of Children’s Literature</i> (2005) refer to as “the classic or conventional fairy tales of Perrault, the Grimms, and [Hans Christian] Andersen” (180) is, literally and figuratively, a textbook example of the canonical. As Maria Tatar (2017) reminds us, “print cultures enshrined standard tale versions that made variants deviations from the norm rather than unique reinventions. [But] those canonical versions of a story are nothing more than a fiction propping up our faith in defunct archetypes.” What is more, the fairy tale’s status as children’s literature, as part of that body of literature, is itself highly contested. Tatar credits Bruno Bettelheim’s <i>The Uses of Enchantment</i> (1976) with “put[ting] fairy tales squarely back into the canon of children’s literature,” while the editors of the <i>Norton Anthology</i> point to the fairy tale’s “incorporation into children’s formal education” at the end of the nineteenth century, a “trend . . . reinforced in the twentieth century.” “With the help of teachers and librarians,” they report, “the fairy tale became a staple of education throughout the West, and naturally a canon for children was established.” Both Tatar’s implication that fairy tales had been removed from the canon of children’s literature at one time and the Norton editors’ suggestion that canons are formed “naturally” bespeak this genre’s complicated status within the larger body of children’s literature.</p>
<p>Fairy tales and YA novels bookend the history of children’s literature, but what comes in between is also marked by its attention to the corporeal and by worries over its status and stature. Eva Cherniavsky (2007) reminds us that it was not until the rise of “feminism, race and ethnic studies, and postcolonial studies” that “critical attention” was paid to “forms of material and abstract embodiment” and that “body thus has a relatively brief [career] as a focus of critical engagement in the study of culture.” Studies of race and gender made possible, she argues, “a turn to those human subjects historically associated with the discredited life of the material body and so constituted as marginal to the arenas of cultural production and political representation: women, Africans and their New World descendants, Indigenous peoples, mestizos, and Asians, among other categories of ‘overembodied’ ethnic, sexual, and classed identity.” To that list of marginalized bodies we might add the body of the child, and indeed, the history of children’s literature and culture seems to follow the pattern Cherniavsky lays out: the inclusive aspirations of <i>Sesame Street</i> (first broadcast in 1969) and the rise of the YA novel in the 1960s and 1970s suggest that an interest in the “corporealized identity” of the child was also made possible by theories of race, class, gender, and orientation.</p>
<p>It is actually quite difficult to keep the sex out of the fairy tale, as Bill Willingham’s <i>Fables</i> (2002–15) makes graphically clear. As Adam Zolkover emphasizes, “The characters in <i>Fables</i> are emotionally complex, sexually explicit, and physically present. In their transition to the comic book page, they are fleshed out, corporealized. . . . And further, as part of that same transition, they are eroticized” (2008, 42). That eroticization, he finds, “brings to the fore a great deal of the sexuality that is implicitly pervasive in the fairy-tale genre as a whole” (46). Similarly, in her exploration of three fairy tales that employ “the motif of cross-dressing” (“The Counterfeit Marquise,” “Starlight,” and “Belle-Belle ou le Chevalier Fortuné”), Lisa Brocklebank emphasizes the <span id="p29" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="29"></span>“potent critique of the status quo that begins with an examination of gender norms” and connects the tales’ emphasis on “the performativity of gender and gender relations” with “the dynamics behind canon formation” (2000, 127). She asks, “Why have these tales come to be regarded as only for the nursery, when their original audience was highly sophisticated members of the French court?”</p>
<p>Just as indicative of children’s literature and culture’s fascination with gender and sexuality is the teacher’s “‘mysterious’ copy of ‘Professor somebody’s Anatomy’” in <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> (1876), “about which the children’s curiosity is at a fever pitch,” as Claudia Nelson (2004) reminds us. Ruth Saxton (1998) finds that “contemporary literary investigations into the Girl continue to envision girlhood according to tropes and plots familiar since the dawn of novelistic fiction” and that “physicality—the Girl’s experience of her body, engagement in or denial of sex, her cultural ‘value’ as young female body—remains crucial.” An especially clear example of the body’s significance in literature for (and about) children can be found in the cross-dressing fictions of the nineteenth century, including Horatio Alger’s <i>Tattered Tom</i> (1871), Eliza Leslie’s “The Boy Girl” (1831) and “Billy Bedlow; Or, The Girl Boy” (1832), and Mark Twain’s unfinished 1897 story “Hellfire Hotchkiss” (Taketani 1999; Norton 1999). Particularly interesting in this regard is <i>Tvillingsystrarna: Berättelse för unga flicko</i> (<i>The Twin Sisters: A Story for Young Girls</i>; 1893), a Swedish novel by Ellen Idström that “describes the creation of a new woman through an educational regime patterned on the upbringing of boys. By contrasting the progress of two twin sisters, one of which is brought up as a boy and the other as a girl, the novel explores gendered aspects of education, embodiment, and experience” (Andersson 2016). <i>Tvillingsystrarna</i> is not an anomaly either, as Andersson makes plain when she situates it among “Swedish books for girls around the turn of the twentieth century” that “exemplify the wide range of behaviors that were explicitly coded as masculine.”</p>
<p>Those books and their open exploration of gender and sexuality stand in marked contrast to their US counterparts half a century earlier, which are dedicated to disciplining the tomboy—in extremely corporeal fashion, usually by breaking her back—out of her nonnormative behavior. Susan Coolidge’s <i>What Katy Did</i> (1872), Louisa May Alcott’s <i>Jack and Jill</i> (1880), and Eleanor Porter’s <i>Pollyanna</i> (1913) share with a host of other nineteenth-century fictions a focus on the transgressive body in need of discipline and punishment. The “repeated images of corporal punishment” in Catherine Sinclair’s <i>Holiday House</i> (1839) are, as Jackie Horne (2001) argues, “deeply intertwined with the ‘new’ aspects of the novel, in particular its construction of the Romantic child.”</p>
<p>“Historically, Finnish girls’ literature generally follows the same themes, styles, and sub-genres as its Anglo-American counterpart,” Myry Voipio (2013) asserts, but in the last ten years, in what she calls “the new wave” of Finnish girls’ literature, “sexuality is the most prominent theme,” something the protagonists “consider their own business” and, like “real contemporary Finnish girls [they] value their own decision making when it comes to their sexuality.” “The novels,” she finds, “bluntly describe different aspects of sexuality” and “openly represent a girl’s sexual desire that generates pure pleasure instead of feelings of fear, shame or anxiety.” In the UK and the US, Aidan Chambers’s (1978–2005) six-novel “dance sequence” treats “issues of touch, desire, [and] masturbation,” while Alice McKinley’s examination of her vagina with a hand mirror in Phyllis Reynolds Naylor’s <i>The Grooming of Alice</i> (2000) and the “play-by-play description of how to have intercourse” in Judy Blume’s <i>Forever</i> (1975) bespeak <span id="p30" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="30"></span>twentieth- and twenty-first-century culture’s desire to instruct (and delight) the child by explaining, and celebrating, her bodily nature (Trites 2000).</p>
<p>But to note those examples is not to deny a powerful strain of censorship with respect to the body of the child still at work in the culture. James Kincaid’s (1992) argument that post-Victorian Western culture in general ignores the existence of children’s sexuality is still applicable, and arguably those texts that depict an asexual, normative child are most likely to be included in the canon of children’s literature. As Bettina Kümmerling-Meibauer and Anja Müller argue, twenty-first-century “approaches to canon issues in children’s literature . . . retain an approach to the canon as an authoritative structure that makes statements about the intrinsic values of texts” (2017, 4).</p>
<p>The debate over the canon is of particular relevance to the field of children’s literature, for not only was children’s literature long excluded from the canon—an exclusion that is part of the institutional history of the field—but the debate also, paradoxically, makes us consider the fact that, as Beverly Lyon Clark (2003) puts it, “canonical works are always, in some sense, literature for children.” Similarly, Jerry Griswold’s (1996) assertion that “the American schoolroom was . . . the place where canons were made” (returning us to the link between curriculum and canon the <i>Norton Anthology</i> editors make about fairy tales) indicates that children’s literature is both what is excluded and what is included. “Canonical works are precisely those that a culture wishes to preserve by passing them on to its young,” Clark (2003) asserts. Or, as Guillory insists, “an individual’s judgment that a work is great does nothing in itself to preserve that work, unless that judgment is made in a certain institutional context, a setting in which it is possible to insure the reproduction of the work, its continual reintroduction to generations of readers” (1993, 28). According to Guillory, “the canon is never other than an imaginary list,” but “what does have a concrete location as a list . . . is the syllabus, the list of works one reads in a given class, or the curriculum, the list of works one reads in a program of study.” In that regard, then, this essay on “Body,” which contains within it a list of works about the body, might be considered a body of children’s literature about the body—a syllabus of sorts that is canonical in its aims.</p>

<p class="pf">Rooted in old Germanic languages, <i>book</i> is a near relative of <i>beech</i> because of “the practice among Germanic peoples of scratching runes onto strips of wood” or, as others speculate, because of “the use of wooden writing tablets” (<i>OED</i>).

Many children’s books may seem to distill the essence of bookness, opening—like fairy tales or Max’s leafy bedroom in Maurice Sendak’s <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i> (1963)—onto woods and forests. But the long-lived allure of the children’s book, as of the book itself, has many roots and branches owing to the book’s many ways of making meaning: as a format, as a trope, as a material artifact, as a commodity.</p>
<p><i>Book</i> has largely come to mean the book-like thing you may or may not be holding now, that boxy container called a <i>codex</i>. This format, with pages bound between covers, overtook at least two previous technologies used for writing and reading: the clay or wax tablet (Roemer 2007) and the papyrus scroll or book roll (Johnson 2013). We might hesitate to anachronistically call these earlier inscription formats “books.” Yet with the same sleight of hand that turns computer screens into “desktops,” we are inclined to say we’re reading “books” digitally on our tablets, Nooks, and Kindles. The <i>OED</i> allows that “<i>book</i> may refer to a literary work in portable form written on a wide variety of other materials (as vellum, parchment, papyrus, cotton, silk, palm leaves, bark, tablets of wood, ivory, slate, metal, etc.), and put together in any of a number of forms (as a scroll, or as separate leaves which may be hinged, strung, stitched, or glued together).”</p>
<p>When we talk about reading or writing books, we tend to conflate container (whatever shape it takes) and contents. With the understanding that such a significant cultural artifact will always exceed categorization, in exploring <i>book</i> as a keyword, this essay leans toward materiality, container over content. For many people, an attachment to books in general as well as to particular ones derives from their tangible, haptic qualities—that they can, for example, when the size is right, be held in the hand (Piper 2012, 1–12). But while the codex book form and letterpress printing have had a long reign in the West, books have always come in other shapes using other inscription technologies. Media scholars distinguish between “media and formats”; the book, in this view, is a <i>format</i> and “a category of material goods . . . as well as a powerful metonym” (Gitelman 2014, 3, 6).</p>
<p>As a material format that can hide and reveal its contents, the book has been a reliquary-like vessel of religious and esoteric writing: Hindu Vedas, Buddhist sutras, the Torah, the Bible, the Koran. Due perhaps to these sacred resonances, as a trope the book offers to make vast swathes of experience legible: the book of life, of nature, of memory, of fate, of judgment. While colloquially the book stands metonymically for its contents (I’ve read that book), at the level of state, school, or religious authority, the book operates like an effigy (they’ve banned or burned that book). Where reading is widely valued as a good in itself, books in general, and books for children especially, have accrued symbolic social and cultural <span id="p32" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="32"></span>capital, as if the book form had an intrinsic value and an inherent power distinct from its content.</p>
<p>Books, in whatever shape or form, have always been in the hands of children, who learned to read and write on cuneiform tablets in the second-millennium BC Sumer (Robson 2007, 70–73), were schooled in Homer in ancient Greece and Rome (Lerer 2008, 24), recited from the first grammars off the Mainz and Venetian presses in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (Grendler 1989, 418), and learned their catechism in primers and read chapbook versions of old romances and ballads in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (Spufford 1985, 211; St. Clair 2007, 340). Generations of European children learned Latin and vernacular languages with Johann Amos Comenius’s <i>Orbis Sensualium Pictus</i> (<i>The Visible World in Pictures</i>; 1658; see also Hürlimann 1968, 127–32).</p>
<p>But it took eighteenth-century print entrepreneurs to invent the <i>category</i> of the children’s book when, circa 1750, the English bookseller Matthew Allison advertised “children’s books of all sorts” amid the glimmering of a modern publishing industry (<i>OED</i>; Grenby 2011, 5). In the Anglo-American tradition, though others had sold books to children, the printer John Newbery was the first to market “a quality brand of children’s books” (Immel 2010, 740–41). His <i>Little Pretty Pocket-Book</i> (1744) remains a handy touchstone, modeling long-standing aspects of the modern children’s book, designed to entertain and prizing littleness, cuteness, pictures, and a warm relation between books and toys (it was sold with a ball or a pincushion; Darton [1932, 1958] 1970, 1–3). Widely reprinted in early America, Newbery’s many steady sellers included <i>The Renowned History of Giles Gingerbread, a Little Boy, Who Lived upon Learning</i> (London, 1764; Boston, ca. 1776) and <i>The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes</i> (London, 1765; New York, 1775). Such books’ small size, fetching woodcuts, and often avuncular direct address to child readers promoted what was widely viewed as a desirable bond between book and child, which a famous and long-lived <i>New England Primer</i> rhyme captured as “My Book and Heart / Shall never part.”</p>
<p>The openly commercial origin of the genre exposes tensions about the very category of the book for children. In contrast to literary genres differentiated by their formal qualities (prose, poetry, drama), “children’s book” initiated a classification by readership, followed in the nineteenth century by “boys’ books” and “girls’ books” and in the mid-twentieth century by “young adult” books (Talley 2011; Kidd 2011b, 167). Such rubrics serve to make shopping easy, library cataloging rational, school committees pacified, authors and publishers profitable. And yet they may also bind the books they tag to putatively stable but actually quite fluid age and gender categories, uneasily interpellating a child, girl, boy, or young adult reader.</p>
<p>The book-as-commodity also raises the question of just how much the publishing industry has profited over time from children and their books. Contemporary best sellers (think Harry Potter) underscore what economic engines children’s books can be (Marcus 2008, 312–15). Historically, too, children’s books have always buoyed publishers’ bottom lines, from the earliest grammars, to <i>Aesop’s Fables</i>, to McGuffey readers, to fairy tales, to textbooks in constant and ever-updated demand. But we lack crucial metrics for an economic history of children’s books, since historical statistics and figures have been notoriously difficult to come by (Suarez 2009, 48–49).</p>
<p>If books make money, still their status as commodities is occluded by a widespread “anti-commercial insistence that books are not ordinary products, but rather ‘symbolic goods’” (Sánchez-Eppler 2008, 202). Like many other objects of intimate identification and fetishization, books are also fundamentally material <span id="p33" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="33"></span>artifacts and, as such, are explored by the interdisciplinary field of book history. Such an approach to the book object analyzes its size and form, the labor that went into its manufacture, the economics of its production and circulation, and even what anthropologists would call its “social life” (Appadurai 1986, 13)—that is, its journey from its commodity form to its stint as a particular child’s book to, sometimes, its afterlife as a family heirloom or an artifact in the archive (as Lissa Paul’s keywords essay observes).</p>
<p>For example, children’s “gift books” and blank “friendship albums” in the nineteenth century included spaces for signing and inscribing, and many other books retain affectionate tributes to children by family members and friends. Children themselves would often sign their books with protective rhymes: “Steal not this book my honest friend for fear the gallows will be your end” (Crain 2016, 116). Whether “stories of possession” or of subversion (Lerer 2012, 131, 135), children’s marginalia mark their engagement with and even, in a way, co-authorship of their books. The scribble-driven plot of Chris Van Allsburg’s <i>Bad Day at Riverbend</i> (1995) depends entirely on a child’s mediation as Old West townsfolk struggle to solve the alarming mystery of the “shiny, greasy slime” that her crayons have scrawled across the horses, cattle, and landscape of her coloring book.</p>
<p>In even more material ways, children have long been bookmakers themselves. The Brontë children (Anne, Charlotte, Emily, and Branwell) famously created manuscript books (Ezell 2014, 96), preserved because they are regarded as the juvenilia of notable authors. For centuries, young people have written in makeshift or purchased diary volumes, none more venerated—for both its vivid writerly contents and the poignance of what it represents—than Anne Frank’s red plaid journal. Other children became published authors, like Palle Huld, the Danish boy who wrote <i>A Boy Scout around the World</i> at fifteen, or Daisy Ashford, who wrote her wonderful comic Victorian novel <i>The Young Visiters or, Mr. Salteena’s Plan</i> at nine, though it was published years later. Less celebrated children, too, have creatively “self-published”: two generations of the New England Hale family’s children produced 183 tiny manuscript volumes “in a wide array of genres” (Sánchez-Eppler 2008, 189). Children’s handmade books speak of the entry of children into the system of books, with a ludic and satiric awareness of protocols and genres. And yet while elite children were making their own parlor books, working children had been involved in the book trade since the beginning—in print shops, in type foundries, and in paper mills and as compositors, inkers, and hand-colorists of illustrations (Abbott 1855; Grundy 2009, 148).</p>
<p>Books make meaning, then, not only by being read but also by being sold, given, owned, written in, or made. Even as a signifier in text or image, a book can speak of social or economic status, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of education. A child portrayed with a book might convey his docility or piety or aspiration but might also suggest that he has the leisure to read and the money to own a book. In much children’s literature and visual imagery, children who are associated with books are thought to be inside the social order, while those lacking them, through choice or chance, are marked as racial or class others or outsiders. To bring <i>children</i> together with <i>book</i> can efface a thoughtful critique of either term; a nostalgic or sacralized sense of children or books can lead to inadvertent accepting and inculcating of race, class, gender, and other stereotypes under the cover of the innocence of a “children’s book” (Nel 2017b; Bernstein 2011b).</p>
<p>Across the sociopolitical spectrum, adults have long anxiously strived to monitor children’s contact with books. The digital-medial shift of recent decades calls <span id="p34" class="page" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="34"></span>up long-held feelings and concerns about children <i>in relation</i> to books, provoking debates about e-books and screen reading versus print (Kleckner, Martens, and Stoltz 2014). If it is true that books are now widely multimodal, with audio books and e-books now commonplace, alternative book formats have long been available to “print disabled readers” (Mills 2012). Taking the side of the codex form, Lane Smith’s gently satiric <i>It’s a Book</i> (2010) pictures a monkey reading a book and patiently fielding the questions of a digital-native jackass: “How do you scroll down?” and “Does it need a password?” <i>Treasure Island</i>, it turns out, is the text, and the book ends up captivating the jackass. And yet, mightn’t he be just as engrossed reading Stevenson on a tablet? If we worry about children’s relation to “cyberspace” (James and James 2008, 123), we might recall the extent to which books too have always been not only objects but spaces through which children have long roamed.</p>
