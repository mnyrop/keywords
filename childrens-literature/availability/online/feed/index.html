				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the beginnings of African American children’s literature around the turn of the twentieth century, the parameters of what should be included has been as much of a source of conflict as the terminology used to label this group of people. Commenting on the contested nature of this genre, Dianne Johnson (1990) asserts in <em>Telling Tales: the Pedagogy and Promise of African American Literature for Youth</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Like children’s literature, as a broad category, African American children’s literature is a label which refers to the intended audience. On the other hand, like Afro-American literature, Black children’s literature refers to the ethnic and racial identities of the authors. When the two categories are combined into one, the parameters of the new category are much less clear. This confusion in definition is important, largely because of the deliberate uses to which the literature is put.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In this passage, Johnson highlights the shifting terminology associated with the people, and therefore with the genre—African American, Afro-American, Black—as well as the anomalous nature of the genre itself: unlike most literary genres, children’s and young adult literature are defined by audience, not by authorship.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in stating that “Black children’s literature refers to the ethnic and racial identities of the authors,” Johnson articulates her position on one end of a significant continuum. African American children’s literature can be defined inclusively or exclusively. Scholars who define the genre inclusively (e.g., MacCann 1998; Nikola-Lisa 1998; Martin 2004) consider texts written by African American authors and illustrators as belonging to the genre, but also include texts about the Black experience and/or the image of the Black child written by non–African Americans. Those who define the genre exclusively (e.g., Bishop 1982, 2007; Johnson 1990; McNair and Brooks 2008) include only those texts written by African Americans about African Americans. Clearly, how broadly the genre is defined will largely shape discussions of its history and evolution, and one cannot trace this history without some understanding of the changing terminology that has labeled the genre throughout the late nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries.</p>
<p>Countee Cullen’s poem “Heritage” (1947) articulates a salient question for contemporary African Americans:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>One three centuries removed</em><br />
<em>From the scenes his fathers loved,</em><br />
<em>Spicy grove, cinnamon tree,</em><br />
<em>What is Africa to me?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Of what relevance is Africa to Blacks whose home is North America and whose ancestors came from Africa? And more to the point of this discussion, how did “African Americans” come to be called African Americans, and what, then, constitutes “African American children’s literature”? Since children’s literature is defined by audience, critics who define African American children’s literature by the race or ethnicity of the author identify it differently from the mainstream of children’s literature. The genre that is now called “African American children’s literature” has, from the early twentieth century on, experienced a number of title shifts. In their 2003 study “Understanding of Race and the Construction of African-American Identity,” Vetta L. Sanders Thompson and Maysa Akbar summarize these descriptors: “African, African American, Black American, Black, and person/people of color . . . Negro, and Colored.” Likewise, this literature has been called Negro, Black, Afro-American and African American children’s literature. A brief examination of the changes in these descriptors will illuminate some of the perennial problems with defining Black American children’s literature.</p>
<p>In <em>Race, Rhetoric and Identity: The Architecton of Soul</em>, Molefi Kete Asante (2005) writes that from 1619 until 1817, most Black Americans felt a sense of pride about their connection with Africa. Black shipping merchant Captain Paul Cuffee even launched an expedition in 1815–16 through which thirty-eight colonists emigrated to Sierra Leone (Cuffee 1811); Cuffee believed this would “allow Africans and African Americans to realize their full potential” (Gaines 2007). In 1817, however, when a group of influential Whites formed the African Colonization Society, which also sought to resettle American Blacks in Africa, many Blacks, particularly freedmen, made a concerted effort to disprove their Africanness, offering reasons that ultimately illustrated their acceptance of racist, white supremacist ideology (Asante 2005). Hence, after 1817, the term “Negro” came to be preferred over “African American.”</p>
<p>The <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> (<em>OED</em>) defines a “Negro” as a member of a dark-skinned group of peoples originally native to sub-Saharan Africa; a person of black African origin or descent.” The term “remained the standard designation throughout the 17th to 19th centuries, and was still used as a standard designation, preferred by prominent black American campaigners such as W. E. B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington, until the middle years of the 20th century” (<em>OED Online</em>, s.v. “Negro”).</p>
<p>This linguistic history illuminates why Carter G. Woodson, widely known as the “Father of Black History,” labeled his contributions “Negro” rather than “African”: the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (1915), the <em>Journal of Negro History</em> (1916), Negro History Week (1926), and the <em>Negro History Bulletin</em> (1938) (Smith 2004).</p>
<p>During the 1960s Black Power movement, “<em>black</em> was reclaimed as an expression of racial pride” and “Negro” fell out of favor, though still employed in names of important organizations such as the United Negro College Fund (<em>OED Online</em>, s.v. “African-American”), and “Black children’s literature” is still widely accepted as a label for the genre. According to the <em>OED</em>, an African American is “An American (esp. North American) of African origin; a black American.” Although the <em>OED</em> identifies “Afro-American” as a synonym, because “afro” also recalls the hairstyle popularized during the 1960s, the connotations of this term are, perhaps, more politicized. The<em> OED</em> also notes:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Although both </em>African<em> and </em>African-American<em> were widely used in the United States in the 19th century, the adoption of African-American as a preferred term among black Americans dates from the late 1960s and early 1970s (particularly after an April 1972 conference at which Ramona Edelin, president of the National Urban Coalition, proposed its use). The term gained widespread acceptance following its endorsement by the Reverend Jesse Jackson (b. 1941) during his presidential nomination campaign in 1988.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Because of the turbulent history of African Americans and the power dynamics that remain in place within the American education system and publishing industry, the definition of this genre continues to be conflicted.</p>
<p>Although they were not specifically for Black children, early literary efforts to educate a rapidly growing literate Black population included pit schools, freedmen’s schools, and antebellum newspapers. Particularly important were church-based papers such as the African Methodist Episcopal’s <em>Christian Recorder</em>; established in 1852, which remains the oldest continuously published Black paper in the United States (Bishop 2007). In <em>Children’s Literature of the Harlem Renaissance</em>, Katharine Capshaw Smith (2004) offers an extensive analysis of “cross-written” texts—those that spoke to Black children and adults simultaneously, often with an eye toward influencing adults ideologically through children who, during Reconstruction and the early twentieth century, were often more literate than the adults who cared for them. Ironically, the novel widely considered the first work of Negro children’s literature, <em>Clarence and Corrine, or God’s Way</em> by Mrs. Amelia E. Johnson (1890), though written by a Black woman, features no Black characters. This, according to some, excludes it from the genre.</p>
<p>Those who define the genre exclusively consider the 1920s and the Harlem Renaissance the beginning of African American children’s literature because this was the first time that so many Black writers composed texts specifically for Black children. Prior to this time, Black children appeared primarily in children’s books written by White authors for White children’s entertainment—usually at the expense of the Black characters. Although abolitionist tracts such as <em>The Slave’s Friend </em>(1836–38) had made some efforts to portray the humanity of Black people, more common were plantation sketches such as E. W. Kemble’s <em>A Coon Alphabet</em> (1898) and the rhyming ditty <em>The Ten Little Niggers </em>(1875). These stories looked nostalgically at plantation life, depicted Black characters as idiotic and dispensable pickaninnies with wooly, unkempt hair and exaggerated facial features. Although it is about a South Indian boy, and not an African American child, Helen Bannerman’s <em>The Story of Little Black Sambo</em> (1899), one of the most controversial picture books in the history of children’s literature, is often considered within Black children’s literature partly because of the proliferation of unauthorized versions reillustrated by Americans in the minstrel tradition. While some readers appreciate Sambo because he was for a long time one of the few children of color in the “all-white world” of children’s fiction (Larrick 1965), others see Bannerman’s images as demeaning and resent her use of the term “Sambo.” Because mainstream American publishers had no interest in positive representations of the Negro in the early twentieth century and argued that Negroes neither read nor bought books, positive portrayals of Black children were rare until the 1920s.</p>
<p>The <em>Brownies’ Book Magazine</em>, though it survived for only two years (1920–21), established many important ideals that still undergird African American children’s literature. When W. E. B. Du Bois, Augustus Granville Dill, and Jessie Fauset, leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which published <em>Crisis</em> magazine, first envisioned a magazine specifically for “Children of the Sun,” they articulated seven goals for the publication. Three of these remain basic tenets of the genre: “To make colored children realize that being ‘colored’ is a normal beautiful thing”; “to make them familiar with the history and achievements of the Negro race”; and “to point out the best amusements and joys and worthwhile things of life” (Harris 1986). Their magazine, called <em>Brownies’ Book</em>, included works of fiction, histories of important African Americans, poems, songs, plays, photographs from subscribers, riddles, puzzles, games, and more. Some of the most important authors within the African American literary canon published pieces in the <em>Brownies’ Book</em>. Langston Hughes and Arna Bontemps, two such writers, collaborated on children’s books from the 1930s through the 1970s. Bontemps contributed such a significant body of literature to the genre that Violet J. Harris (1990) characterizes him as the “father” of African American children’s literature.</p>
<p>While the Harlem Renaissance saw the first proliferation of literature written specifically for Black American children, and also established the precedent for what this literature should seek to accomplish, the Black Arts movement of the 1960s—the “aesthetic and spiritual sister of the Black Power concept”—brought dedicated Black authors to the genre, and with them came some significant ideological shifts (Neal 1971). Larry Neal notes that texts of this era reject the White aesthetic and confront the historical realities of the painful past so that they are not forgotten or repeated, and so that this knowledge can empower Black people. Community connections are key to this movement, and within it, the Black artist’s “primary duty is to speak to the spiritual and cultural needs of Black people” (Neal 1971). Both nationalism and separatism fueled this movement, but since authors of children’s books must always be mindful of the child, the militancy of the Black Power movement rarely surfaces in these books. What the genre has taken from this 1960s movement is an intolerance of the unequal treatment of Black children and a confrontation with harsh historical realities in forms that children can understand. Since this era, Black children’s books have spoken much more directly than before to the cultural and spiritual needs of African American children—not necessarily excluding other readers, but addressing “cultural insiders” as the primary audience. Among others, Tom Feelings, Nikki Grimes, Julius Lester, Jerry Pinkney, and Walter Dean Myers—whose careers as children’s and young adult authors began in the 1960s and 1970s—have approached these themes directly.</p>
<p>Where the 1960s gave the genre a sense of reality, the 1990s brought an explosion of delight—both thematic and visual. The last decade of the twentieth century saw more African American children’s books published than ever before, along with a proliferation of Black authors and second-generation Black children’s writers and artists, as well as a new strand of literary themes that invites readers to explore elements of Black culture—such as call-response, signifying, and celebrating nappy hair—that had previously remained more within the domain of Black oral culture. While these texts validate the cultural heritage of African American children, this new level of openness invites all children to learn about, understand, and celebrate some of the common truths of Black American life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The earliest reference to “censor” appears as “one of two magistrates of ancient Rome” (<em>Oxford English Dictionary </em>[<em>OED</em>]), who in addition to taking the census (that is, the registration of citizens, originally for tax purposes), supervised public morals and censured the population (<em>Columbia Encyclopedia</em> 2008). The English words “censor” and “census” are from the Latin <em>censere</em>, which means to appraise, value, judge, consider or assess; “censure” is from the Latin <em>censura</em>, meaning judgment. During the era in which these terms originated, Cato the Elder (234–149 b.c.e.) undertook a vigorous campaign to stem the infiltration of Greek culture (Knowles 2006).</p>
<p>According to the <em>OED</em>, the first modern use of “censor” applied to people whose job it was to ensure that “books, journals, plays, etc.” were free from anything “immoral, heretical or offensive to the State,” and arose in relation to the theater. That is when the “Lord of Misrule” or the “Abbott of Unreason” evolved into the Stage Censor (c. 1555–83). A related term, “bowdlerize,” also arising out of censorship of theatrical productions, commemorates Thomas Bowdler (1754–1825), who published a book of Shakespeare’s plays—with all sexual or vulgar references removed (McArthur 1998).</p>
<p>The earliest use of the word “censorship” in the context of children’s literature developed in tandem with Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s eighteenth-century concept of “the natural child” as innocent and in need of protection. The only book Rousseau allowed his hypothetical boy protégé in <em>Émile</em> (1762) was Daniel Defoe’s <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> (1719); ironically, Sarah Trimmer, in her <em>Family Magazine</em> (1778–89), attacked bawdy passages in Defoe’s novel<em>, </em>as well as those in Perrault’s fairy tales, as inappropriate for children. Over the last two hundred years, children’s books targeted for censure reflect changing ideas about childhood and notions of suitability. What constitutes “censorship,” and whether limiting access to a book violates children’s right to read or protects them from danger, has been a longstanding matter of debate.</p>
<p>In dealing with sensitive and complex issues, there is no simple resolution to the dynamic tension between the need to protect children and the willingness to trust the relationship between a writer and a reader. British psychologist Nicholas Tucker, in <em>The Child and the Book </em>(1990), notes that occasionally a child may respond adversely to a story, but, while “situations like this are bound to happen sometimes, they can best be modified by discussion afterwards rather than censorships before.” Similarly, Kornei Chukovsky (1963), in his study of Russian children “protected” from myths and fairy tales, says censorship does not work because children create their own fantasy stories and worlds in place of literature.</p>
<p>Attempts to suppress dime novels in the United States in the 1860s or penny dreadfuls in Britain (which later evolved into series books) were unsuccessful despite claims that they would encourage children and working-class youth to engage in criminal behavior. Foster’s Education Act of 1870 was also opposed by some on the grounds that encouraging mass literacy would lead to crime and madness (Mullin 2003). Dr. Fredric Wertham’s<em> Seduction of the Innocent</em> (1954) attacked comic books as a negative influence.</p>
<p>Prior to the rise of “new realism” in the 1960s, the general consensus about children’s literature was that difficult topics such as death, racial conflict, or sexual permissiveness were taboo and therefore simply did not appear (Postman 1994). Topics often censored include sexual content, language, violence, homosexuality, race, and religion (Whelan 2009). By the twentieth century, censorship of children’s literature developed a specialized vocabulary of its own, including words such as “challenge,” “quiet-censorship,” “covert-censorship,” and “self-censorship.”</p>
<p>“Challenge” takes the form of an official written complaint to a school or library (Hopkins 1996), though the American Library Association (2009) estimates that the number of challenges reported represent only a quarter of the actual total number, and also reports that the Harry Potter series ranks as the most challenged book series of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>“Quiet censorship” refers to publishers of children’s literature who, in anticipation of negative reaction or unwanted pressure from the public, exercise censorship outside of the public eye (Hunt 1997). Publisher censorship can occur at any stage of the process: prior to acceptance, in the final negotiations prior to publication, when the book is re-released in paperback, when illustrations are changed, or when the book is translated. Twice Beatrix Potter was pressured to delete material: in <em>The </em><em>Tailor of Gloucester </em>(1903), a rat drinks from a black bottle (it was censored)<em>, </em>and in <em>The Tale of Tom Kitten </em>(1907), Tom’s clothes come off (she refused the changes).</p>
<p>Other actors in the quiet censorship arena include individuals, groups, or communities, who, once a book is published, may pressure publishers, public institutions (such as libraries or schools), or even commercial enterprises (such as book and video stores) to suppress, remove, or limit access to material (Hopkins 1996). These unofficial censors may attempt to enforce certain values by purging schools and libraries of “controversial” books or circulating lists of “objectionable” books and authors. Many librarians attest to acts of rogue or “covert censorship” in which angry readers white out, black out, tear out, razor out, or ink out what they deem to be offensive portions—as in copies of Maurice Sendak’s<em> In the Night Kitchen</em> (1970) where such readers cover up the young boy’s genitals.</p>
<p>Authors also practice self-censorship, making decisions about what might be acceptable in a children’s book—sometimes, as Craig Howes (2004) says, “working against free expression [and thus becoming] self-silencing.” Three children’s book writers—Lois Lowry, Gillian Rubinstein, and Erik Haugaard—confess to occasional self-censorship, sometimes out of economic concerns or fear of publisher’s remarks or possible attacks from pubic censors. As Lowry put it, “I began to consider each bad word that appeared from my . . . word processor, and to question whether it needed to be there” (Nilsen and Bosmajian 1996).</p>
<p>Conversely, children’s literature has historically provided a venue for resistance to censorship. During the McCarthy era in the United States, writing for children became a safe refuge for creative people on the left who were able to work under pseudonyms and evade censorship (Mickenberg 2006). In <em>The Day They Came to Arrest the Book</em> (1988), Nat Hentoff highlights censorship issues by examining <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> (1884), which he believes is a useful tool for educators (in part because of its language) in exploring racism, slavery, and the moral dilemmas of its era.</p>
<p>Since librarians or teachers can easily be fired for censorship reasons (Kantor 2007), often a single complaint can frighten them into removing an item immediately. In addition to the fear of receiving a complaint or of corrupting children, teachers censor material to avoid frightening or saddening children, or to avoid introducing controversy into their classroom, thus steering clear of Eve Bunting’s <em>Fly Away Home</em> (1991) (dealing with homelessness), or Faith Ringgold’s <em>Tar Beach</em> (1991) (a family struggles for financial security) (Wollman-Bonilla 1998). One of the most common objections to children’s books is “inappropriate language,” often labeled obscene or pornographic. On these grounds, John Steinbeck’s <em>Of Mice and Men </em>(1937), J. D. Salinger’s <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> (1951), and Katherine Paterson’s <em>The Great Gilly Hopkins</em> (1978) have all faced censorship.</p>
<p>While censorship of a book based on its gender bias, sexism, or racism is more accepted by society, this approach has led to certain books being censored for embodying “outmoded” attitudes representative of the period in which they were written. For example, Helen Bannerman’s <em>Little Black Sambo</em> (1899), Travers’s <em>Mary Poppins </em>(1934), Hugh Lofting’s <em>The Story of Dr Dolittle </em>(1920), and Hergé’s<em> Tintin au Congo</em> (1931) have all been banned due to negative representations of Africans or African-Americans (MacLeod 1983). Books attacked for their political message include George Orwell’s <em>Animal Farm</em> (1945; communism) and Michael J. Caduto and Joseph Bruchac’s <em>Keepers of the Earth</em> (1988; environmentalism, native spirituality) (Karolides 1999; Zimmerman 2000). Stories like these are attacked because of perceptions that, even within a sociohistorical context, negative attitudes toward multiculturalism, the role of women, the physically challenged, racial, social, or sexual minorities, or religion are no longer acceptable.</p>
<p>Some have sought to ban children’s literature on moral grounds. Books targeted for promoting antisocial behavior include Dav Pilkey’s <em>Adventures of Captain Underpants</em> (1997; bad behavior, toilet humor), Louise Fitzhugh’s <em>Harriet the Spy</em> (1964; lying and window-peeping), Paul Zindel’s <em>The Pigman </em>(1968; lying, swearing, drinking, drug abuse, disrespect for authority and property), Robert Cormier’s <em>The Chocolate War </em>(1974; mob rule, masturbation), S. E. Hinton’s <em>The Outsiders </em>(1967a; gangs), Alice Childress’s <em>A Hero Ain’t Nothin’ But a Sandwich </em>(1982; drug addiction, swearing, Black militancy), Trina Schart Hyman’s Caldecott-winning <em>Little Red Riding Hood</em> (1983; there is a bottle of wine in Little Red Riding Hood’s basket), and Isabelle Holland’s <em>Heads You Win, Tails I Lose</em> (1973; drug abuse). Safety concerns have also resulted in objections to books depicting young children engaged in dangerous behaviors such as turning on a stove, climbing a ladder, or walking alone. Books that have been banned due to depictions of violence include Fitzhugh’s <em>Bang, Bang You’re Dead </em>(1986) and R. L. Stine’s Wizards, Warriors and You series (1985). Those opposed to these works argue instead for the use of ethical heroes (see Chetwin in Lehr 1995).</p>
<p>In a 2009 survey of librarians (Whelan 2009), 87 percent said the main reason they avoid certain books is because they include sexuality or sex education. This content seldom appears in literature for young children but is constantly surfacing in works for young adults and includes controversial themes such as: masturbation and sexuality, as in Judy Blume’s <em>Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret </em>(1970), <em>Deenie </em>(1973), and <em>Then Again, Maybe I Won’t </em>(1971); teenage pregnancy, as in Josephine Kamm’s <em>Young Mother</em> (1968); conception, as in Norma Klein’s <em>Naomi in the Middle </em>(1974); nonmarital sex, as in Klein’s <em>Mom, the Wolf Man, and Me</em> (1972); infanticide, as in Lois Lowry’s <em>The Giver</em> (1993); abortion, as in Klein’s <em>It’s Not What You Expect </em>(1973); contraception, as in Blume’s <em>Forever</em> (1975<em>)</em>; AIDS, as in Mary Kate Jordan, Abby Levine, and Judith Friedman’s <em>Losing Uncle Tim</em> (1989); and, of course, premarital sex, as in Blume’s <em>Deenie </em>and<em> Forever,</em> Klein’s <em>It’s Okay If You Don’t Love Me </em>(1977)<em>, </em>and Francesca Lia Block’s Weetzie Bat series (1989–2005). Teachers and administrators are often pressured to remove these books from schools. In a related but less sensitive topic, nudity or body parts are sometimes labeled as “obscene”; recently, for example, there have been objections to Susan Patron’s Newbery Medal winner<em> The Higher Power of Lucky</em> (2006), in which a rattlesnake bites the main character’s dog’s “scrotum.”</p>
<p>Homosexuality, often a focus of censorship, was cited by 47 percent of censoring librarians in the aforementioned survey (Whelan 2009). Books cited for this reason include John Knowles’s <em>A Separate Peace </em>(1959), Michael Willhoite’s <em>Daddy’s Roommate</em> (1990), Aaron Fricke’s <em>Reflections of a Rock Lobster </em>(1981), A. J. Homes’s <em>Jack</em> (1990), Deborah Hautzig’s <em>Hey Dollface </em>(1978), and Anne Heron’s <em>Two Teenagers in Twenty </em>(1993).</p>
<p>Some images or references in literature may inspire a hostile reaction from people with particular religious convictions. Pullman’s<em> The Golden Compass </em>(1995) was pulled from Catholic schools when the popular film adaptation was released in theatres (Abley 2007). One of the most contested issues in educational circles today is the labeling of Wicca, native spirituality, and other earth-based approaches to spirituality as witchcraft, the occult, or satanic worship (Barry 1992; “Books Involving Witchcraft” 1994). Due to their “occult” themes, Paterson’s <em>Bridge to Terabithia</em> (1977) was once the most frequently challenged, and J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter books quickly became the most protested ever with 472 complaints. Some groups believe that <em>any</em> teaching about non-Western religions (Buddhism, Taoism, etc.), or even yoga or meditation, equate to witchcraft, cultish activity, or attempts to convert children to a religion (Shariff and Manley-Casimir 1999). Others believe that devils and witches are a real force for evil in the world, and argue against any literature featuring them; stories that feature magic, fairies, and ghosts have been attacked for similar reasons. In recent decades, despite strong opposition (Blair 1996), groups of self-declared witches have begun to defend their right to expression and have criticized authors of stories where witches do not appear in a favorable light, including Roald Dahl’s <em>The Witches</em> (1983) (Barry 1992).</p>
<p>Today, questions of who can write or speak for whom often lead to charges of censorship. Many censors on the left either are sympathetic to or come from embattled cultural or racial minorities who feel they are already threatened—sometimes physically, sometimes socially. Concern about negative stereotypes leads naturally to the question of “cultural appropriation”: should a non-Chinese interpret Chinese folktales? Should Europeans or their descendants try to retell native legends? Lissa Paul (2000), for example, attacks books such as Jan Bourdeau Waboose’s <em>Morning on the Lake </em>(1997) for “boutique multiculturalism” (to use Stanley Fish’s [1997] term), to explain how ethnicity is watered down and designated as “too foreign” for children. The difficult questions in censorship come to the fore more forcefully when children are given books written for adults, with mature themes and difficult choices. For example, Margaret Mitchell’s <em>Gone with the Wind</em> (1936) and David Guterson’s <em>Snow Falling on Cedars</em> (1994) were both written with adult audiences and sensibilities in mind. Also, it is important to note that banned books often become even more attractive to readers. As Peter Hunt (1997), who gets the final word on the subject, notes: “The censorship of children’s literature is a texture of paradoxes: between benevolent control and fearful repression; between common-sense attitudes to words and meanings and necessary freedom of interpretation; between a ‘trivial’ subject and a far-from-trivial reaction to it—and, as we have seen in contemporary Britain, between the overt and the covert.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The concept of character has two uses in children’s literature discourse. One use belongs to literary criticism, as the critic and reader observe the people in a story or novel as “characters,” that is, as agents or actors (Burke 1973) whose actions move a story through time. The other use refers to the moral qualities of a person. These uses of “character” are related, as the root of the English word lies in a Greek word for a tool used to mark or engrave a material (<em>Oxford English Dictionary </em>[<em>OED</em>]).</p>
<p>By the seventeenth century, the English word came to mean both “the individuality impressed by nature and habit on man or nation; mental or moral constitution” and a “personality invested with distinctive attributes and qualities, by a novelist or dramatist” (<em>OED</em>). In his 1927 lectures later published as <em>Aspects of the Novel</em>, E. M. Forster distinguished “flat” from “round” characters, the former being relatively simple and predictable in their thoughts and actions, such as the Wolf in the Grimms’ “Little Red Riding Hood” (1812) or the title character of <em>The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes</em> (1765). The latter kind, such as Anne in L. M. Montgomery’s <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> (1908) or Jin in Gene Luen Yang’s <em>American Born Chinese</em> (2006), are more complex, full of tensions, contradictions, and human unpredictability—in short, more like real people. The complexity of characters in children’s literature has increased over time. As adults came to see children as more complex people, not just as “miniature adults,” so the authors for children came to write more complex and “real” characters in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>The concept of character as a moral quality of the individual reflected bourgeois gender arrangements in the nineteenth century. Historians see this very masculine concept as a product of the changing nature of men’s work in the Industrial Revolution, in the creation of “separate spheres” of life (men in the workplace, women at home to take care of the moral education of the children), and in the related “crisis in masculinity” in the waning decades of the century. The concept also weds religious—especially Protestant—ideas to work and manliness. The idea of “muscular Christianity” arose in this era. As exemplified by fiction such as Thomas Hughes’s <em>Tom Brown’s Schooldays</em> (1857), “muscular Christianity” saw physical fitness, sports, and outdoor recreation as good for the boy’s mind and morals as well as his body. Related to the concept of character were the concepts of honor and duty. The ideal man of the era demonstrated “good character,” which meant that he understood and met his responsibilities to family, work, and the nation.</p>
<p>Boys and young men received instruction in good character through a number of genres. Between 1870 and 1910, for example, there was a flood of new nonfiction “success manuals” offering advice to young men on the virtues of “honesty, frugality, industry, reliability, and loyalty” (Hilkey 1997). These manuals, along with novels of the period, proclaimed the central truth of Andrew Carnegie’s (1889) famous essay “Wealth”—namely, that the man of good character, the man who practices the social and moral virtues, will enjoy tangible and intangible wealth.</p>
<p>The advice manuals were for young men, but the fiction reinforcing these messages reached down to even younger boys. Horatio Alger, Jr.’s stories of young men whose fortunes improve through hard work, moral virtue, and some luck, as told in novels beginning with <em>Ragged Dick</em> (1868), became so famous that the phrase “Horatio Alger story” has come to signify the formulaic “rags-to-riches” story popular in American culture. Edward Stratemeyer’s syndicate mass-produced hundreds of formulaic novels, usually in series, written by a stable of authors who worked under pseudonyms (Billman 1986; Johnson 1993). Stratemeyer began in 1899 with his own Rover Boys novels, but the syndicate eventually produced some of the most famous younger reader series in American history, including the Hardy Boys, Tom Swift, and Nancy Drew (Greenwald 2004; Rehak 2005; Connelly 2008).</p>
<p>By the early twentieth century, some adults were worrying that the adventure and violence in these novels were having adverse affects on young male readers. A few decades earlier there had been a “moral panic” about sensational “dime novels,” and by 1910 the new concern was about the sorts of novels that the Stratemeyer syndicate was producing. In 1914 the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) enlisted Grosset and Dunlap, the publishers of juvenile series novels, in a project to create a series known as “Every Boys Library—Boy Scout Edition.” The series bore the imprimatur of the BSA and published a range of wholesome fiction meant to demonstrate good, strong character, from reprints of novels by Jack London and Ernest Thompson Seton to new works (e.g., Dimock 1912).</p>
<p>The novels of Percy Keese Fitzhugh (1876–1950) stand out as more complex fictional accounts of moral dilemmas and how boys might try to employ virtue to act as men of character. Beginning with <em>Tom Slade, Boy Scout</em> (1915), over the next two decades Fitzhugh wrote dozens of series novels with Boy Scouts as the central characters. These novels, published with the approval of the BSA by Grosset and Dunlap, departed from the simplistic moral didacticism of some of the other juvenile fiction. Fitzhugh uses humor and seriousness to explore the difficulties of applying rules (such as the twelve points of the Scout Law) to real situations, where the rules might conflict (e.g., in Fitzhugh 1920). The Fitzhugh novels show the boy reader that a man of character can face moral or ethical dilemmas, can act according to his best judgment, and (most important) can accept the consequences of his decision “like a man.”</p>
<p>Historians see that first decade of the twentieth century as a watershed era, when American society moved from a production-oriented economy to a consumer-based one, and the nineteenth-century concept of “character” gave way to the twentieth-century concept of “personality” (Susman 1984). Whereas “character” was attached to masculine social virtues, including honor and duty, “personality” invoked a “real self” apart from social roles and even from the restricting rules of society—and, unlike “character,” “personality” included feminine selves, too. So “character” largely disappeared from children’s literature from the 1920s through the 1970s. More precisely, while some authors of children’s literature still promoted social and personal virtues, talk of “character” seemed old-fashioned and even oppressive. It took the “culture wars” of the 1980s to revive the concept.</p>
<p>The election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency in 1980 and the role of the Religious Right in that victory signaled to many that the United States was experiencing new culture wars pitting social and religious orthodoxy against progressivism (Hunter 1991). As happened nearly a century earlier, many adults perceived a “character crisis” in young people and vowed to restore moral education, “character education,” to schools and other institutions socializing the young (Hunter 2000). At the center of these efforts are the “Character Counts!” movement and network, created by the Center for Youth Ethics, a project of the Josephson Institute of Ethics (founded 1987), and the Center for the Fourth and Fifth Rs (Respect and Responsibility) at the Cortland campus of the State University of New York.</p>
<p>Character Counts! and related organizations recommend fiction for children and youth on their websites. On the Character Counts! website is a list of “children’s books that build character,” coded by reading level and by one of the six “Pillars of Character” (trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship) that the particular novel or storybook reinforces. Schools and public libraries put similar lists on their websites, often using the same “Pillars” to help parents or young readers select books. On these lists appear some familiar authors, such as Betsy Byars, Louis Sachar, Armstrong Perry, and Cynthia Voight. Sachar’s <em>Marvin Redpost: Why Pick on Me? </em>(1993b), for example, receives praise for its attention to trust, while his <em>Marvin Redpost: Is He a Girl?</em> (1993a) teaches children about caring. Some lists include more controversial authors, such as S. E. Hinton and J. K. Rowling, both of whom have experienced attempts to remove their books from school libraries and curricula.</p>
<p>The periodical banning of books for children and youth signals the very political nature of reading fiction amid the culture wars. Few adults would argue against the six virtues touted by Character Counts!, nor would many object to children’s literature that values the virtues. The politicizing of children’s literature, dragging authors and books into the culture wars, harms this project of communicating virtues to children and young readers, especially when some of the recommended literature presents simplistic didacticism and some sites steer parents and teachers away from juvenile fiction that is more complex and morally conflicted.</p>
<p>The gender issue permeates the debates over character education and literature in the early twenty-first century. The sense of a character crisis and the response by juvenile fiction writers a century ago was distinctly male. The present-day adult moral panic about character includes girls, but the term “character,” with all of its historical contexts, seems not quite right in talking about the qualities the society now desires in girls and young women. Juvenile fiction for girls dealing with bullying, sexual abuse, teen pregnancy, and drug use—unlikely to appear on Character Counts! and related lists of recommended reading—certainly addresses the qualities of “strong” girls.</p>
<p>The concept of good “character” is so tied to the culturally conservative position in the culture wars (Hunter 1991, 2000), and is so locked into a nineteenth-century masculine concept of moral behavior, that the term no longer seems useful in thinking about the role of literature in the moral education of both boys and girls in the twenty-first century. Fieldwork-based research on the everyday lives of children and adolescents that seeks to understand how youth experience and deal with moral dilemmas in their everyday lives (e.g., Goodwin 2006) now sees boys and girls as much more alike than previously thought in the ways they deal with problems. If, as this research suggests, girls are becoming more like boys in their friendship cultures, and if both boys and girls actually practice more nuanced moral reasoning than the rigid, absolutist positions advocated by most “character education” experts, then reader-response criticism needs to respect the “native” categories young people use in thinking and talking about negotiating challenges, conflicts, and moral dilemmas in their everyday lives. Whether or not the term “character” is a native category among young people, male or female, remains to be seen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The word “class” comes to English from the Latin <em>classis </em>via the French<em> classe</em>. It first appears in Thomas Blount’s <em>Glossographia</em> (1656), where he defined it in the language of the times as “an order or distribution of people according to their several Degrees.” Citing Blount, the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> (<em>OED</em>) traces the term’s origins to its use by Servius Tullius who, seeking to raise funds for the Roman military, conducted a census for the purpose of taxing citizens according to their means. He created six categories or classes, based on property or net wealth (Kostick 2005). In spite of the strong resonance of its etymology with contemporary socioeconomic understandings of class, when it first entered the English language <em>classe </em>had greater purchase in reference to a division of scholars or students, and later as a natural history term. According to the <em>OED</em>, its use in regard to a social division or grouping does not reappear until 1772. Until then, “estate,” “order,” “rank,” and “degree,” terms that originated in medieval times, continued to be used to describe social positions. The use of word “class” is therefore historically associated with the Industrial Revolution and the rise of capitalism, making it somewhat anachronistic to apply it to earlier systems of class division that appear in children’s fiction.</p>
<p>According to Raymond Williams (1983a), the trigger that led to “class” superseding earlier terms was the recognition that “social position is made rather than merely inherited,” indeed, increasing consciousness that particular social systems “actually created social divisions.” The notion that social position is made is particularly important in children’s literature, which abounds in rags-to-riches and triumph-of-the-underdog stories, from Joseph Jacob’s 1890 version of “Jack and the Beanstalk,” to Horatio Alger, Jr.’s <em>Ragged Dick</em> (1868), <em>Struggling Upward</em> (1890), and other books for boys, to Louis Sachar’s <em>Holes</em> (1998). It informs modernized variants of the Cinderella story, including the feature film <em>A Cinderella Story</em> (Rosman 2004) and Shannon Hale’s novel <em>Princess Academy</em> (2005). These tropes bear witness to a notion of class as a hierarchical system of social classification—or as E. P. Thompson (1963/1980) puts it, a relational category evident in the notions of upper, middle, lower, and under classes—that nevertheless offers the potential for social mobility that is usually upward in children’s texts, although occasionally downward for privileged protagonists, as in Lauren Child’s <em>Hubert Horatio Bartle Bobton-Trent </em>(2004).</p>
<p>Children’s fiction is less straightforward in representing the unequal distribution of social and economic resources, or how power and privilege inheres in class structure and impedes social mobility. This may be because, as Williams (1983a) points out, “class” is a “difficult word” when it comes to the actual basis upon which social divisions are understood and thus represented. Its ambiguities are a product of the national and historical variations in usage, as well as the different empirical criteria and conceptual models used to measure and theorize it. These competing genealogies result in understandings of class that alternately overlap, occlude, and contradict each other.</p>
<p>Williams identifies the source of confusions about <em>class</em> in the late eighteenth century. In addition to referring to a system of ranking according to social status—implicit in Blount’s glossing of the term—it begins to be used to differentiate “productive” and “unproductive classes.” Coining “class” as a verb in <em>The Wealth of Nations</em> (1776), Adam Smith states, “‘I have classed artificers, manufacturers, and merchants among the productive laborers’” (<em>OED</em>). Class thus begins to become an expression of an economic relationship, a model brought to fruition by Karl Marx as a relation to modes of production. Although clearly linked, status and economic models of class do not exactly coincide. The former is a hierarchical ranking based on social distinction; the latter is a fundamentally binary split based on the division between those who own the mode of production and those who sell their labor (Marx 1859). Historical and contemporary constructions of the middle class make this tension explicit: grouped with the working class according to the economic model—middle-class people work, after all—they are ranked more highly than the working class according to the status model.</p>
<p>The status model of social stratification reflects, but is not reducible to, economic inequality or material productive forces (Williams 1983a; Wright 1985), a fact made apparent in images of genteel poverty in Louisa May Alcott’s <em>Little Women</em> (1868–69) and Ethel Turner’s <em>Seven Little Australians</em> (1894). Marx’s model is economically determinist, but it offers a mode of class analysis that <em>explains</em> class inequality and offers the potential for revolutionary change (Connell 1983). These two systems sit in an uneasy relation in children’s literature and its scholarship, not only because in literary theory class is inextricably linked with Marxist criticism, but because of children’s perceived relation to production.</p>
<p>At the same time as notions of productive and unproductive classes gained currency, children and their literature began to acquire special status. Didactic and utopian in sentiment, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century children’s fiction came to reflect a belief in the myth of childhood as lying outside of the injustices of the social order and the world of work. The result, according to Fred Inglis (1981), is that in children’s fiction the reading of class is “always and endlessly capable of being relocated in the classless paradise.” Pointing to the likes of Arthur Ransome’s<em> Swallows and Amazons </em>(1931), Kenneth Grahame’s <em>The</em> <em>Wind in the Willows</em> (1908), and E. Nesbit’s <em>The Railway Children</em> (1906) as “stabilizing fictions,” Ian Wojcik-Andrews (1993) asks, “[W]hat better way to control and assuage class struggle and class conflict in reality than through classless utopias in fiction?” However, to the extent that class consciousness and struggle centers on a recognition of the exploitation of labor, this is problematic, since, as Maria Nikolajeva (2002a) points out, “children don’t work.” Although, as she acknowledges, this is not historically true, children cannot have an occupation as such. When labor is depicted in children’s literature, it tends to be transformed into “play,” “an evil,” or “distanc[ed] to the historical past,” as in Robert Cormier’s <em>Fade</em> (1988). In contemporary fiction showing the exploitation of labor, such as Cynthia Kadohata’s <em>Kira-Kira</em> (2004), or the effects of poverty, such as Sherman Alexie’s <em>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</em> (2007), issues of class are often overwritten by race or ethnicity. This does not mean that Marxist criticism is irrelevant to children’s literature, but the project it enables may in fact occlude the pertinence of status models to the genre.</p>
<p>Certainly, Marx saw a direct correspondence between the economic base or mode of production and the social, intellectual, and political superstructure as an ideological vehicle of the class status quo. Refined by Louis Althusser (1971), class ideology is a system of representation, making literature a potential means for disseminating and normalizing values in the service of the interests of the dominant class—or resisting them. Thus, the Marxist critic of children’s literature Jack Zipes (1983) shows how the folk tales of the common people were transformed into literary fairy tales that reflected and subverted the values of the aristocracy. Writing about English children’s literature, Bob Dixon (1977) emphasizes the corollary, arguing that “until very recent times, working class characters, if they appeared at all, appeared invariably in minor roles and in very few categories. They could be objects of charity (but only if loyal and obedient workers); repugnant characters, often criminals, who posed a menace to the social structure; or menials who were usually funny.” However, here again the tension between productive and unproductive classes comes to the fore, since in spite of the persistence of inherited class positions in Britain, the opposition underpinning Dixon’s analysis is between the working and middle classes. Children’s literature has long been middle class in it consumption and production, and from this perspective, class division is necessarily informed by status.</p>
<p>If the opposition between productive and unproductive classes suggests an economic relationship, it also encodes value judgments, including those of moral and other worth such as Dixon’s observations about the British working class suggest. In <em>The Making of the Modern Child: Children’s Literature and Childhood in the Late Eighteenth Century</em>, Andrew O’Malley (2003) shows how the demonization of the rich and stigmatization of the poor in children’s literature under the rise of industrial capitalism reflected a preoccupation with the construction of the middle-class subject. This subject embodies the values of individualism, such as “thrift, self-denial, industry . . . and education,” and achieves social mobility through personal merit, virtue, and hard work. Thus, the child protagonists in the English-American author Frances Hodgson Burnett’s <em>Little Lord Fauntleroy</em> (1886) and <em>A Little Princess</em> (1905) are rewarded for their virtue by being rescued from their penury. Obscuring the structural inequality created by the mode of production, such tropes locate class positions and their transcendence as a function of individual dispositions, rather than the collective struggle associated with working-class consciousness in Marx’s model.</p>
<p>Although Max Weber (1922) argued for an opposition between class and status, and Williams treats them as separate entries in <em>Keywords</em>, their connectedness is particularly important in relation to the representation of class in children’s literature, especially in contemporary texts. Clearly, the two are intricately linked, as demonstrated by Pierre Bourdieu’s (1986) theorization of the nexus between economic capital and the symbolic, social, and cultural capital that underpin the status model. Indeed, children’s literature typically depicts class difference through symbols of status, rather than relations to labor. It also resolves class conflict through the status model: characters such as Charlie in Roald Dahl’s <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em> (1964) or Ryan in the U.S. teen television series <em>The OC</em> (2003–7), who perform (or learn to perform) behaviors and express values appropriate to the middle class, are rewarded with social mobility (Bullen 2007). However, insofar as the “language of status” displaces the “language of class” in these texts, it dissipates the radical aspects of class consciousness by “appearing to cancel out class in the sense of formation or even broad group, and [by] providing a model of society which is not only hierarchical and individually competitive but is essentially defined in terms of consumption and display” (Williams 1983a). To the extent that children’s narratives reduce class to a status model, they serve the interests of capital.</p>
<p>This is even more acute in American children’s literature, informed as it is by the myths of a classless society, the American Dream, and a descriptive model of socioeconomic status that identifies up to 70 percent of Americans as middle class (Gilbert 2002; Thompson and Hickey 2005) in spite of economic inequality. As Eric Lott (2007) points out, in the United States, class is “[c]losely related to such categories as ‘station,’ ‘status,’ ‘group’ and ‘kind’” and “resonates with implications of value, quality, respectability, and religious virtue,” and that it is thus “difficult to pry capital loose from rectitude.” Similarly, middle-class values are difficult to “pry loose” from social mobility, as is social status from consumerism and display. The contemporary heroine of Meg Cabot’s <em>The Princess Diaries</em> (2000), Mia, may be a modern-day Cinderella, but her political-activist sensibilities reflect the values of the contemporary middle class. She also performs its consumerist values—an ethos that is even more overt in mass-market young adult fiction series such as <em>Gossip Girl</em> (Von Ziegesar’s 2002) and <em>The Insiders</em> (Minter 2004), which conflate class status with the conspicuous consumption of luxury goods, excluding those who fail as consumers of taste and distinction.</p>
<p>However, it is not only in America that class awareness is weak. Some argue that the late twentieth century witnessed the “death of class” (Pakulski and Waters 1996). It also saw a decline in the use of class as a category of analysis in children’s literature (Wojcik-Andrews 1993) and, with the shift towards identity politics, in cultural and literary studies more generally (Eagleton 1996). This does not mean that class is no longer relevant. In its continued promotion of middle-class values, children’s literature seeks to socialize readers into values and ways of being that may facilitate social mobility. At the same time, in using the language of status, it obfuscates those structural inequalities in the capitalist class system that impede social mobility. The core conflict in children’s literature analysis of class, then, is how the critic employing the concept understands its reference points in terms of Marxist class analysis, the Weberian status model, or a Bourdieuan synthesis of the economic and non-economic capital. The application of these approaches is also highly dependent on the historical period in which the narrative is written and/or set, given that class demarcations have changed dramatically with the rise of consumer capitalism, globalization, and expansion of the middle classes in the contemporary West. Current children’s literature research and scholarship will need to be responsive to the changing class structures of the contemporary world.</p>

<p>A barrage of associated terminology attends the advance of empire, and none of it fires with exactitude. “Imperialism” usually refers to “the practice, the theory, and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan centre ruling a distant territory” (Said 1993)—that is to say, the politics, the economics, and the enabling ideology behind the promulgation of empires. “Colonialism” is generally understood as the assemblage of ways by which one nation or people imposes direct rule over another nation or people. “Colonization” refers specifically to the establishment of settler colonies in foreign lands. “Neo-colonialism,” a term coined by Kwame Nkrumah (the first president of Ghana, itself the first of Britain’s African colonies to politically decolonize), refers to that postcolonial condition by which a newly constituted (or now reconstituted and liberated) nation-state is only “in theory independent. . . . In reality its economic system and thus its political policy is directed from the outside” (Hadjor 1992) by its former ruler, or by a new surrogate.</p>
<p>But it is “empire” that shimmered to the schoolboy and, perhaps to a slightly lesser extent, the schoolgirl reader of British children’s literature from the 1850s onward. It was empire that flushed pink British pride into a world map shown to be one-quarter “British” in 1897, at the time of the Diamond Jubilee celebration of Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and Empress of India. It was empire that breathed fire into an endless stream of memorabilia, collectibles, advertisements, play activities, costumes, and club formations, in Britain and abroad, throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. And it is empire that continues, despite its declared end, to play a foundational role in the subject-formation of the children on both sides of the imperial divide.</p>
<p>From its beginnings, the word “empire” has held a close “etymological connexion” to the ideas of power through, and subjectivity under, militarism (<em>Oxford English Dictionary </em>[<em>OED</em>]). The word “emperor”—with its attendant sedimentation of Roman centralization, citizenship, and hegemony—entered the English language around 1225, almost a century before the word “empire” (<em>OED</em>). “Empire” is rooted in the concept of “supreme and extensive political dominion . . . exercised by an ‘emperor,’” and then later, “by a sovereign state over its dependencies” (<em>OED</em>). The personal element of the British emperor—“Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Empress of India [as of 1876], Defender of the Faith”—was sometimes obscured in British children’s literature of “the period of high imperialism,” and even in children’s games and puzzles, where Britannia replaces the body of the emperor/empress (Norcia 2009). That said, an inherent celebration of military supremacy remained a prominent component of imperial pageantry abroad, as evidenced in representations of Victoria’s Golden and Diamond Jubilees.</p>
<p>“English” schoolchildren found it relatively easy to identify with the shimmering, overdetermined category of “Britishness” promulgated within the idea of empire<em>, </em>but non-English readers and consumers of empire’s ubiquitous address found themselves distanced, and internally split, by the category: “subjects” of empire on the one hand, objects of empire on the other. The idea of a globally inclusive, British subjectivity, promulgated throughout the “British Isles,” the “Dominions,” and the “Colonies” through publications like <em>The Boy’s Own Paper </em>(1879–1967) and Nelson’s <em>Royal Readers</em> (1875–95), rested on an embedded narrative of imperial cultural “progress” wherein non-English traditional practices and languages, celebrated as they were for their exoticism and difference, would necessarily in time give way to a “larger” and emancipatory “Britishness” that empire eventually would bestow. “British,” Raymond Williams would write in <em>Border Country </em>(1960), his novel of rural south Wales, “was hardly ever used without ‘Empire’ following, and for that nobody had any use at all” (Gikandi 1996). Nirad Chaudhuri’s dedication to his 1951 <em>The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian</em> captures this split subjectivity of empire’s ideological force with painful clarity: “To the memory of the British Empire in India,” he writes, “which conferred subjecthood on us but withheld citizenship; to which yet every one of us threw out the challenge: ‘<em>civis britannicus sum.</em>’”</p>
<p>In<em> Keywords</em> (1976)<em>,</em> Williams circumvents empire’s splitting impetus, focusing instead on the more stable social concept of “imperialism” as a modern political system developed “especially after 1870,” and inevitably associated with a self-proclaimed “civilizing mission.” Williams notes a later, early-twentieth-century shift in connotation, where imperialism becomes “understood primarily as an economic system of external investment and the penetration and control of markets and sources of raw materials.” Postcolonial literary writers, including writers of children’s literature (see Ngũgĩ 1986), have been at pains to retain the ideological force of empire as a divisive and diminishing social message well into the present day. Bennett, Grossberg, and Morris (2005) dropped “Imperialism” from their <em>New Keywords,</em> substituting “Colonialism” as “a general term signifying domination and hegemony.” In their introduction to that volume, the editors indicate that they have deleted “those of Williams’s keywords that we feel have not sustained their importance,” emphasizing instead a “shift to a collective and more international mode of production.” <em>Keywords for American Studies</em>, on the other hand, revives “empire” in a specifically American, post–2003 Iraq War context, tracing “arguments about the possible virtues of U.S. empire” from the 1803 Louisiana Purchase to the present (Streeby 2007). The sliding fortunes of “empire” in keywords dictionaries suggest a stabilization and diminishment in the term—movements that may be related—and thus it remains useful to interrogate the concept as an organizing principle in American and British children’s literature, and as a category of critical analysis. As Williams (1976) notes, keywords not only reflect but also produce “continuity and discontinuity, and also deep conflicts of value and belief.”</p>
<p>While “empire” has functioned as a category of critical analysis for literature read <em>by</em> children since the late 1970s, with particular focus on adventure novels (see Green 1979), some critics have suggested that it has been insufficiently explored in texts written <em>for</em> children. Peter Hunt and Karen Sands (2000) argue that “empire” and “post-empire,” that is, colonialism and postcolonialism, are undertheorized in British children’s literature: first, because the notion that children’s books “were the witting or unwitting agents of the empire-builders” is “so apparently obvious” (a hiding-in-plain-sight argument), and second, because recent postcolonial studies have focused on “the other” and not on “the centre, the imperialist coloniser.” Hunt and Sands note the degree to which “empire” lingers as an unvoiced theme in post-1945 children’s genres, such as in the animal fantasy (e.g., Michael Bond’s Paddington stories, Richard Adams’s <em>Watership Down</em>) whose characters “learn that the Brits are still on top” (Hunt and Sands 2000).</p>
<p>Like Hunt and Sands, Daphne M. Kutzer (2000) suggests that “little attention has been paid to imperialism and its intersections with literature intended for those ‘future rulers of the world.’” As Kutzer’s phrasing might suggest, much of what early criticism there was on the topic focused on high imperialist writing for boys (see Richards 1989; Bristow 1991), a trend identified by J. S. Bratton in 1989 but continuing, with some exceptions (see McGillis 1996), until recently. The emphasis on writing for boys—leaving to one side the question of whether the texts were also read by girls, as they almost certainly were—resulted in a critical stress on the genres of the adventure novel and the schoolboy novel, where the interpellation of the boy subject as imperial ruler and/or colonial administrator is often overt. Fueled by scholarship on imperial feminism (Chaudhuri and Strobel 1992; Midgley 1998), on the “New Girl” (as a parallel to the “New Woman”; Mitchell 1995), and, to a lesser degree, by the rise of “girls’ studies,” especially in the American academy (Kearney 2009), recent years have witnessed new interest in the imbrication of writing for girls and questions of empire. While such writing drew on traditions of masculine adventure (Norcia 2004a; Horne 2004), it also led to the development of new subgenres, like the nursing novel (Smith 2009). Kutzer’s claim that “children’s literature is highly [she suggests inherently] conservative” (Kutzer 2000) is challenged by the complicated relations between late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century feminism and writing for girls.</p>
<p>Further complicating the relationship between writing for children and questions of empire, Jacqueline Rose, Perry Nodelman, and Satadru Sen align the children’s writer with the imperialist. <em>The Case of Peter Pan</em> (1984), Rose’s controversial Lacanian and deconstructive exploration of adult desire for an idea of the child, and of adult “colonization” of childhood, did not of itself launch a rethinking of the relationship between children and their books; it did, however, model rigorous investigation of the uses of children’s texts and of relations of power between children and adults. Nodelman (1992) pushed the colonial analogy farther, asserting that “child psychology and children’s literature are imperialist activities.” More recently, critics like Sen (2004) have begun exploring the nature and affect of writing for colonial child subjects, or “colonized children.” An issue that has not yet received significant attention is the question of the relation of class to the project of empire. While this issue has received attention with regard to children’s history and childhood studies, with some exceptions (see Boone 2005) it remains largely absent from questions of children’s literature.</p>
<p>Regardless of readership and address—child or adult, colonizer or colonized, imperialist or imperial subject—the question underlying writing for children and the matter of empire remains at heart one of interpellation, the calling into being of the child as sovereign or as split subject, hailed into complex social identifications by the seemingly simple but structurally complex, and continuing, literature of empire<em>. </em>As Mrs. Ernest Ames writes in her <em>An ABC, for Baby Patriots</em> (1899),</p>
<blockquote><p><em>F is the Flag</em><br />
<em> Which wherever you see</em><br />
<em> You know that beneath it</em><br />
<em> You’re happy and free.</em></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The “Golden Age” is a Greco-Roman concept, introduced in Hesiod’s <em>Works and Days, </em>which pictures a race of men who “lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting beyond the reach of all evils” (2007). In children’s literature, the term was first proposed by the mid-twentieth century British biographer (and Inkling) Roger Lancelyn Green, whose use of it was ideologically freighted but historically useful. Since Green, however, the term has spread and morphed to become a designation of generic excellence: there is a “Golden Age” of children’s book illustration, a “second Golden Age” of children’s fantasy, and a “Golden Age” of African American children’s books. As Raymond Williams (1976) notes of every keyword he included, “Golden Age” seems “inextricably bound up with the problems it was being used to discuss.” In the case of “Golden Age,” does the paradigm tint—or even obscure—the picture?</p>
<p>The first Golden Age of children’s literature began, more or less, with <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> (1865) and ended with <em>Winnie-the-Pooh</em> (1926)<em>, </em>although some would start earlier, with Catherine Sinclair’s <em>Holiday House</em> (1839), or end earlier, with <em>Peter Pan</em> (1911). In <em>Tellers of Tales</em> (1965), Green is less interested in marking boundaries than in describing the underlying cultural shift that allowed excellent children’s books to be produced. He sees Kenneth Grahame’s <em>Golden Age</em> (1895) as a watershed text: “Suddenly children were no longer being written down to any more—they were being written up: you were enjoying spring in its own right and for itself, not looking on it anxiously as a prelude to summer.” It makes sense that Grahame and Green, as Oxford-educated Englishmen, would seize on a classical metaphor to describe the pastoral, pagan world of childhood. But it is vital to remember that this metaphor did not describe the whole world, but rather the middle- and upper-middle-class strata of the British Empire. This limitation is also a strength because it implies that the “Golden Age” was not a mythic space but an historical time period.</p>
<p>In his landmark study <em>The Romantic Ideology</em> (1977)<em>, </em>Jerome McGann complains that “the scholarship and criticism of Romanticism and its works are dominated by a Romantic Ideology, by an uncritical absorption in Romanticism’s own self-representations.” Grahame’s <em>Golden Age</em> draws on Romantic assumptions about childhood, but so does Green’s “Golden Age.” From his Marxist perspective, McGann would describe both Grahame and Green as engaging in Romantic dramas of displacement and idealization, in which the vision of a timeless utopia elides textual conflicts and contradictions. <em>Tellers of Tales </em>thus emerges, not as a critical text, but as a wonderful example of the phenomenon it seeks to explain. The question then becomes: Does the term “Golden Age” always, and in every context, re-inscribe Romantic assumptions, or can it be used to unpack the Romantic ideologies that structure classic children’s books?</p>
<p>According to Green, “Golden Age” authors such as Lewis Carroll, George MacDonald, and Frances Hodgson Burnett realized for the first time that children were not just undeveloped adults. This allowed them to understand childhood as a life-stage with positive attributes that should be creatively celebrated, not didactically squelched. Childhood thus became “a good thing, a joyous thing—a new world to be explored, a new species to be observed and described, a precious experience to be recaptured out of the past and presented truly and lovingly for its own sake” (Green 1965). Like Charles Darwin’s Galapagos turtles and birds, it was thought that children “naturally” inhabited a Neverland—a separate sphere—that was cut off from civilization. Green presents this “new world” as a place that was discovered, not invented, by mid-century Victorians. Children, he suggests, were suddenly seen <em>as they really are</em>. Tellingly, Green locates this perceptual shift at the moment children exited the workforce <em>en masse</em> and retreated into the segregated spaces of the school and the nursery. To lose “the child” as a productive laborer was to gain “childhood” as a productive metaphor, one that Green so eloquently describes precisely because he shares its cultural assumptions. He did not fully account for the “Golden Age,” but by naming it he opened the door to later critical assessments of both the term and the historical period.</p>
<p>At its height, the collective dream of childhood as a “Golden Age” generated British fairy tales, fantasy, and nonsense verse. Realist American novelists such as Louisa May Alcott and Mark Twain fit only awkwardly into the paradigm, and American poets like Henry Wadsworth Longfellow were problematic because they continued to write for a dual readership of children and adults. The core group of “Golden Age” writers is thus comprised of Edward Lear, Lewis Carroll, George MacDonald, Kenneth Grahame, Beatrix Potter, Frances Hodgson Burnett, J. M. Barrie, and A. A. Milne, with grudging nods to Alcott (whose children spend too much time with adults) and E. Nesbit (who was rather too commercial). Unlike Green, Humphrey Carpenter, in <em>Secret Gardens: The Golden Age of Children’s Literature from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland to Winnie the Pooh</em> (1985), attempts to historicize the “Golden Age,” asking, “What was it that possessed the late Victorians and Edwardians to create a whole new genre of fiction”?</p>
<p>For Carpenter, childhood during the “Golden Age” was not a newly discovered country but rather a newly constructed utopia, created by adults who wanted to question mainstream society. He divides authors into two categories: “destroyers,” such as Carroll and Lear, whose impulse was to attack social conventions; and “Arcadians,” such as Barrie and Potter, who imagined alternative realms. These categories are useful because they allow readers to see both destroyers and Arcadians as engaged in social critiques. Curiously, however, Carpenter’s wider historical analysis recapitulates the myth of a “Golden Age” even as he attempts to analyze that myth. In his final chapter, he argues that World War I destroyed the possibility of Arcadia; he thus posits the Victorian/Edwardian era as a walled garden in which smaller walled gardens could be cultivated. In Carpenter, the boundaries between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries become as reified as the boundaries between Victorian children and Victorian adults.</p>
<p>One critical tension in the term “Golden Age,” then, stems from the ideal of self-containment. How unique and separate is (or was) the experience of childhood—or, for that matter, the nineteenth century? Fredric Jameson (1981) has argued that most narratives function as “strategies of containment” that mask economic processes. From this perspective, the “gold” in “Golden Age” might be traced to a mine in South Africa. Exploring these questions in <em>Empire’s Children</em>, M. Daphne Kutzer (2000) notes that “the rise of imperialism is roughly contemporaneous with the golden age of children’s literature (approximately 1860–1930), and the two grew up together.” While Kutzer does not explicitly unpack the term “Golden Age,” she does modify its sense of self-containment. Imperialism, Kutzer argues, not only organizes the British Victorian imagination, but it continues to influence children’s literature today: “The longing for empire, or at least for national importance, is reflected in children’s books both of the golden age and of our age.” Moreover, the bordered gardens and Neverlands of Arcadia were products of a British middle class that was in turn supported by an almost borderless imperial economy, so that even when “Golden Age” utopian authors were unconscious of their privilege they still drew on that privilege. The “Golden Age,” Kutzer implies, drew on global resources even as it championed British isolationism, and the ideologies it embraced resonate beyond the world wars and beyond the borders of the British Empire.</p>
<p>Although Kutzer and Green map the spaces and territories of the “Golden Age,” it is crucial to note that the term imagines not just children’s spaces but also children’s bodies. Romantic poets and philosophers discarded the notion of infant depravity, moving to the opposite extreme: children were now spotless innocents trailing clouds of glory. Seen from a Romantic perspective, characters such as Mary Lennox, Peter Rabbit, Winnie-the-Pooh, and even Peter Pan can be mischievous or wrongheaded, but they cannot be evil and they cannot be sexual because they are living their own golden ages. “Golden Age” literature features protagonists of a certain “Golden Age”—not just prepubescent but also prelapsarian, and thus presumably walled off from base urges and adult agendas. Moreover, unlike first-generation Romantic texts, which were aimed at adults, “Golden Age” texts speak to readers who themselves represent, albeit temporarily, an innocent “golden age.”</p>
<p>The status of the Victorian/Edwardian child’s body points to another question raised by the “Golden Age”: Precisely who, if anyone, counts or once counted as innocent? In <em>Child-Loving: The Erotic Child and Victorian Culture</em> (1992), James Kincaid argues that conventional “Golden Age” images—of a walled garden, say, or a band of lost boys—are essentially erotic because they fetishize the border between childhood and adulthood. Unlike Carpenter, Kincaid does not see “Golden Age” authors as dissenters; instead, they emerge as mainstream Victorians who were popular because they tapped into the libidinal energies of their child and adult readers. If the term “Golden Age” works to displace imperial forces, Kincaid suggests that it also displaces (but does not dissolve) the Victorian impulse to repeatedly erect and then violate the boundaries between children and adults.</p>
<p>Similar issues are raised by the debates surrounding Charles Dodgson’s portraits of children, which are literally bathed in the golden light of mid-century photographic technology. Dodgson’s nude photograph of nine-year-old Ellen Hatch might invite us to see her (and ourselves) as innocent, protected by the developmental “golden age” that she embodies; or, that “Golden Age” boundary might contain the ideological complications that make Dodgson’s photography—and his fiction, and indeed his era—so compelling.</p>
<p>If the “Golden Age” conjures images of Arcadian spaces and prelapsarian bodies, it also draws a line between the walled garden and the free market. An explosion of middle-class book-buying power may have spurred the production of “Golden Age” fictions, but within the stories themselves the Victorian mercantile economy is barely in evidence. A major exception is the work of E. Nesbit, whose Bastable children are unabashed “treasure-seekers,” but Nesbit’s status as a “Golden Age” writer is wobbly. In classical mythology, the “Golden Age” ended when Pandora opened her jar full of chaos and discord. For the “Golden Age” of children’s literature, one perceived source of chaos and discord (along with sex) was explicit commercialism—which was not, incidentally, associated with women writers. Even in latecomer A. A. Milne’s work, commercially produced toy animals might walk and talk but they do not discuss their origins in a department store. Nesbit’s celebration of commerce (and commercial success) inspired criticism that she was a purveyor of “prosaic magic” (Green 1965) or a “hack” whose effects on children’s literature are “questionable” (Carpenter 1985). Green and Carpenter assume that authentic Romantic children should not be depicted or treated as consumers, or Arcadia will be at risk.</p>
<p>In sum, then, the term “Golden Age” contains or displaces late-Victorian cultural anxieties about the empire, the body, and the rise of consumerism. However, by identifying a historically specific canon, the term has also enabled later critics such as Kutzer and Kincaid to move beyond Romantic recapitulation. The key, perhaps, is historicization: if the notion of a “Golden Age” stages an escape from history, then the task of the critic involves acknowledging that no one escapes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Based on the classical Greek words <em>ideo</em>, meaning idea, and <em>ology</em>, referring to a branch of knowledge, a systemic set of ideas, or a form of discourse, the concatenated word “ideology” derives from the French <em>ideologie</em>. The concept arose as part of a French philosophical movement in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century period of Enlightenment, and its original meaning was to denote a science of ideas. In the nineteenth century, the term was taken up by Karl Marx to label the unconscious system of beliefs in a social group, and specifically socioeconomic class structures (Bennett, Grossberg, and Morris 2005). Louis Althusser (1971) then revised the concept by using Jacques Lacan’s theories of psychoanalysis, principally his concept of the imaginary, to explain the role of language and representation in producing ideological positions. Althusser’s work was taken up by later Marxist scholars, notably by Fredric Jameson in relation to capitalism and modernity.</p>
<p>While the Marxist usage of the term has been employed in the analysis of children’s texts—for example by Jack Zipes (1980), Ian Wojcik-Andrews (1993), and Elizabeth Parsons (2005)—the more general definition of “ideology” employed in children’s literature analysis is “the system of ideas that define a culture.” This system includes the larger scale of political, cultural, and economic ideas like democracy, Christianity, capitalism and individualism that dominate in the Western world, but also the more intimate identity politics within a culture, in particular those that surround gender, sexuality, race, and class and that effect the distribution of power among individuals in a society. All cultures have ideologies. Sometimes these are recognizably very different from those of the West, particularly in societies that adhere to different religious traditions or in cultures that see the society or the family as more important than the individual. All things produced in a culture are expressions of that culture’s ideology—from architecture, to fashion, to laws, to scientific endeavors, to children’s literature.</p>
<p>Peter Hollindale’s (1998) early essay on ideology in children’s literature was instrumental in generating debate in the field. He works outward from the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> when he describes ideology as “[a] systematic scheme of ideas, usu. relating to politics or society, or to the conduct of a class or group, and regarded as justifying actions, esp. one that is held implicitly or adopted as a whole and maintained regardless of the course of events.” As he indicates, ideologies also work to justify the system they underpin; they are usually normalized and seem to be naturally “the way things are.” That is, they appear unquestionable to the people who belong to that culture. As Perry Nodelman (1992) explains, “Ideology works best by disappearing, so that people simply take their ideological assumptions for granted as the only whole, and unquestionable truth.” For example, in the past white people felt that having black slaves was simply part of the natural order of the world, and based on an assumed “natural” superiority, slavery therefore went unquestioned. Depictions of nonwhite people in children’s literature from such periods reiterate that belief, as in the case of <em>Elsie Dinsmore</em> (1867) (see Sekeres 2005). Even when government policies change, attitudes can remain in place in the culture. Although British imperialism had halted by the time Maurice Sendak wrote <em>Where the Wild Things Are </em>(1963), the story shows a white boy who travels to foreign lands where he easily suppresses the natives and becomes their king in an unproblematic rehearsing of the colonial project (Ball 1997; see also the entry on “Postcolonial”).</p>
<p>Children’s literature tends to be a largely ideologically conservative genre in that it often upholds the values of the culture in which is it produced and consumed as part of an inherently didactic agenda. This is typically the case because, as John Stephens (1992) argues, “[c]hildhood is seen as the crucial formative period in the life of a human being, the time for basic education about the nature of the world, how to live in it, how to relate to other people, what to believe, what and how to think—in general, the intention is to render the world intelligible.” The tensions this produces in children’s literature scholarship, then, can emerge at the fundamental level of a contest over what we, as a society, wish to teach children to believe and value. This teaching can come through language, image, and plot-structures: a story usually rewards or celebrates a character because he or she is acting (or learns to act) in line with the kind of values espoused by the empowered adult culture. Some narratives, however, work to reject the social norms (or the dominant ideological positions) of a culture, such as M. T. Anderson’s <em>Feed </em>(2002)<em>,</em> set in a dystopic future where the protagonist gradually learns to question the ways in which capitalism is destroying the world.</p>
<p>The core conflict for the “ideology” in children’s literature analysis is politicized around this question of values. The work becomes implicated in the so-called culture wars—that is, the battle between the religious and secular conservative right versus leftists who seek greater equality for women, nonwhites, queers, and lower-class peoples (with the inbuilt left assumption that the white, male, middle-class powerbase has employed capitalism to maintain its position of power). Feminist, queer, and postcolonial theorists, as well as theorists who focus on classism, employ ideological modes of interpreting stories. The social/political right denounces them, branding this kind of reading as overtheorizing what the general public often assumes to be the innocent fun of children’s texts. These criticisms of ideological analysis can also be linked to a social belief in the idea that children are, or should be, apolitical beings, and that the stories adults give them, and the analysis of such texts, should be somehow outside politics. Although ideology itself is the neutral description of the system of beliefs that underpin a culture, conservatives wish to claim that children’s literature is not ideological (a position that conveniently works to mask ideology), while those on the left argue that revealing the ideological nature of children’s texts will help readers perceive structural imbalances of power. As T. Purvis and A. Hunt (1993) explain, ideology “always works to favour some and to disadvantage others.”</p>
<p>Ideological scholarship is also criticized because it rejects a focus only on the book/text and instead looks at the real world in which stories are being consumed in order to ask “what children’s literature does to its readers by, for instance, encoding ideological assumptions or disseminating strategies for resisting them” (Reynolds 2007). To interrogate a text’s ideological stance is to use a theoretical framework that pays less attention to the aesthetic qualities of the story because the critique is more interested in the embedded ideological messages of the narrative than in the literary merit of the work. Research therefore does not demarcate high- versus popular-culture texts—unsurprisingly, since those interested in a text’s impact on children are more likely to focus on the most popular or highly trafficked works, regardless of their perceived quality. Ideological analysis might be less concerned with the literary ideas J. K. Rowling “borrowed” in <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</em> (1997) than on the ways in which the narrative privileges the dominance of a white, middle-class boy as the hero whose quest is supported by the lower-class Ron Weasley and “Mudblood” female character Hermione. Similarly, ideological analysis would consider the way the fantasy dimension of the novel (the “wizarding world”) uncritically reproduces a male-run society with the same educational, governmental, economic, and consumer-driven environment of real-world contemporary Britain. The story thus confirms and naturalizes the current state of the world as both typical and impossible to imagine in different terms—even with all the potential a fantasy location offers for reimagining social orders and structures.</p>
<p>Ideological interpretations of children’s literature also tend to be less interested in the views or biographical details of the author and instead focus on the ways in which a story positions the reader to accept a set of values. In addition, the ideological landscape of a fictional story may unconsciously reproduce the author’s values and assumptions without the author’s direct awareness of her or his own biases (Hollindale 1998). Given this, the author’s view of what the story is about or what it teaches children may not give access to ideological positions in the text, many of which exist as covert curricula beneath the overt story. The difference between the surface message and the deeply embedded ideologies in children’s stories can also be at opposite poles. On the surface, the film <em>Shrek</em> (Adamson and Jenson 2001) appears to reject fairy tale norms with a feminist-inspired, empowered princess. On closer examination, Fiona is only able to fight emasculated men like the camped-up Monsieur Hood and his merry men (in tights) and still requires her prince, Shrek, to rescue her and enable their happily-ever-after ending, in a reversion to old-fashioned (or conservative) gender norms.</p>
<p>Given that ideology is often hidden beneath the narrative surface, academics engaging in ideological analysis of children’s literature are criticized for intellectualizing about stories in ways that would not be part of the reading experience of the child. This causes tensions between practitioners of ideological analysis and scholars working with a reader-response paradigm for children’s literature research, and these same tensions also circulate in the popular consciousness, which pits “ideology’” against “common sense” (Sarland 1999). Proponents of ideological analysis, however, agree that no text is innocent of values. They also agree that ideology is always connected to politics, social relations, language and representation, and the distribution of power. In this sense, ideological analysis scrutinizes the cultural work a children’s story does: who it rewards or punishes (and why), how it depicts stereotypes and power-relations, and how it is oriented (as celebrating or critiquing) the existing social, political, and economic structures of the society in and for which it has been written or produced.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Depending on the speaker (children’s author, literary critic, art historian, advertising designer, painter) and the venue (bookstore, literature conference, gallery, marketing meeting), the term “image” implies an array of connotations, purposes, and audiences (Mitchell 1986).

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Depending on the speaker (children’s author, literary critic, art historian, advertising designer, painter) and the venue (bookstore, literature conference, gallery, marketing meeting), the term “image” implies an array of connotations, purposes, and audiences (Mitchell 1986). In the hybrid contexts of the twenty-first century—where visual culture, visual studies, and visual literacy are related but contested terms—“image” crosses disciplinary boundaries and characterizes multimodal activities in classrooms and communication. For children’s literature, an interdisciplinary field drawing upon many scholarly discourses, pedagogical approaches, and modes of creative expression, “image” is a complex and provisional term, always at play and in flux.</p>
<p>Appropriately, the <em>Oxford English Dictionary </em>(<em>OED</em>) variously defines “image” in terms of the likeness and the statue, the “mental representation due to any of the senses,” and the phantom and the apparition, indicating an irreconcilable tension between concrete and abstract. While the earliest meaning of the word, according to Raymond Williams (1976), was “a physical figure or likeness,” a secondary meaning developed around sets of ideas or “mental conceptions, including . . . seeing what does not exist as well as what is not plainly visible.” These concepts were given physical form in art, writing, and other media, abstractions meant to instill or reinforce images. Williams further relates “image” to fiction, idealism, and realism. Building on these bases, the term connects to ideas of truth, trust, and faith; shifting artistic and literary conventions; consciousness, perception, and dreams; “objects of religious veneration” (<em>OED</em>); and the mythic. Williams notes <em>image</em>’s “unfavourable connotations overlapping with <em>idol</em>,” which resonates with W. J. T. Mitchell’s example of the biblical golden calf. This graven image was worshiped as a false god before its original was destroyed, yet the icon lived on in cautionary tales and representational artifacts; the “image” of the golden calf persists in collective memory. “Image,” writes Mitchell (2008), is “a highly abstract and rather minimal entity that can be evoked with a single word. It is enough to name an image to bring it to mind.”</p>
<p>Thus, to use the term “childhood” or produce a likeness of “the child” is to activate and test a mutable image. Any figure of the child or childhood will contradict or coincide with a national imaginary or a commonly held conceit among the members of an organization or system of belief. For example, considering “image” in terms of veneration and idolatry, the image of childhood is held sacred by some and deemed secular by others. Lauren Berlant, in <em>The Queen of America Goes to Washington City</em> (1997), indicts the American fascination with the material and symbolic fetus—a symbol of vulnerability, innocence, and pregnant women’s options—as a potent political image. James Kincaid, in his controversial <em>Child-Loving</em> (1992), notes a pedophilic component in the fascination with actual children and eroticized images of childhood, inviting accusations of obscenity and even blasphemy for activating such a troubling image. William Blake’s <em>Songs of Innocence</em> (1789) and<em> Songs of Experience</em> (1794) and William Wordsworth’s “Prelude” (1805) establish a foundation for the nineteenth-century Romantic child, while Vladimir Nabokov’s <em>Lolita</em> (1955) presents one of our most indelible images of exploited twentieth-century childhood. All these artists and critics call upon audience recognition of cherished, or disturbing, notions of childhood that feed the construction of an ideal or troubling image.</p>
<p>An image, then, is not strictly a picture, although terms such as “picture,” “illustration,” and “image” tend to be used interchangeably. As James Elkins (1999) explains, terms like “word-image” are inaccurate due to “<em>mixtures </em>of reading and seeing. . . . [T]here is ‘reading’ in every image and ‘looking’ in every text.” In order to theorize the image, critics must perform “not only a semiotic, formal analysis, but also a historical and ideological contextualizing” (Mitchell 2008). The ability to grasp the image in a given text is both a formal and a cultural exercise, “a matter of an almost anthropological knowledge” (Barthes 1977); a picture is not “worth a thousand words,” but instead serves as a complement to words in an intimate chain of signification (Miller 1992). A lone picture cannot narrate without context (Sontag 1977). Instead, a word-and-picture combination, a captioned illustration, or a graphic sequence—presented to the reader via some physical medium, whether a book, a canvas, or a living body—helps the active reader generate the image. “[T]he transformation of a medium into an image continues to call for our own participation” (Belting 2005).</p>
<p>Istvan Banyai’s picture book <em>Zoom </em>(1995) serves as an example of how images arise from textual form and content. The book’s title implies the workings of a zoom lens, and its pages offer a series of illustrations-within-illustrations that mime snapshots. There is no written narrative, just an ever-expanding frame that pulls back or zooms from the tiny scale of a toy to the scale of outer space. <em>Zoom</em> is not simply a related series of pictures. Readers attempting to narrate this wordless book find themselves considering the camera apparatus, the human eye, and their place in an infinite universe—in other words, exploring the connotative image beyond the denotative word and picture. Gilles Deleuze (1983/1986, 1985/1989), who theorized the movement image and time image in cinema, conceived of a multifaceted crystal image, alternately transparent and reflective on its surfaces. <em>Zoom </em>operates on such multiple levels.</p>
<p>More so than an isolated illustration, an image functions as a changing collective conceit, determined by culture and situated in time and place. For example, Helen Bannerman’s <em>The Story of Little Black Sambo </em>(1899) once was deemed an appropriate, humorous story for young audiences, and its words and pictures laid the foundation for an insulting image of colonial Indian subjects and people of African heritage alike. In an effort to interrogate the book’s clownish image of blackness, recent scholars have debated the ethno-racial basis of the story, and children’s author-illustrators have revised it. Julius Lester and Jerry Pinkney’s <em>Sam and the Tigers </em>(1996) interprets the tale as African American folklore and nonsensically names all its characters “Sam,” while illustrator Fred Marcellino’s <em>The Story of Little Babaji </em>(1996) gives Bannerman authorial credit while renaming <em>Sambo</em>’s trickster hero and providing affirmative depictions of India. Such countertexts, which tactically alter the words and pictures of a problematic original, have the potential to establish new ideological images.</p>
<p>Many critics of literature, art, and cinema examine “image” through Ferdinand de Saussure’s sign/signifier/signified triad and Charles’s Peirce’s formalist semiotics (which revisit Saussure’s tripartite structure of signification). For his part, Jacques Derrida (1967) sharply distinguishes between sign and image in his account of the codification of written language. For Derrida, reading and vocalizing alphabetical writing depends upon a prior understanding of the images conveyed by the writing, since written communication necessarily has become concise and abstract over generations and across the distances between agricultural and industrial communities. Although his examples come from pictographs, hieroglyphics, and alphabet systems, Derrida might well have considered the commonplace abstractions in ABCs for young readers. The “A” in Crockett Johnson’s <em>Harold’s ABC </em>(1963) stands for “Attic” and takes the shape of the attic itself; the “C,” a typographical character originally colored tan, “turns green” with seasickness as ocean waves get rough in Michael Chesworth’s <em>Alphaboat</em> (2002). Examples like these exploit the slippage between writing, pictures, and the images conjured by literate readers.</p>
<p>Further, it is precisely this slippage that authors and illustrators seek to exploit as they create a text for young readers. Roland Barthes (1977) locates “a linguistic message, a coded iconic message, and a non-coded iconic message” in a commonplace advertisement or comic book, and off-handedly remarks that children learn to negotiate this complex verbal-visual information at an early age. He acknowledges the urge to stabilize interpretation “in such a way as to counter the terror of uncertain signs.” The word-picture text’s creator attempts to manage the formal arrangement and cultural reception of the constructed image, and the spectator is eager to make sense of it too. Therefore, picture books with puzzling imagery (e.g., Maurice Sendak’s goblin-infested <em>Outside over There</em>, 1981) or lack of closure (e.g., Dr. Seuss’s ambiguous <em>The Butter Battle Book</em>, 1984) defy the stability some readers expect from the literature of childhood and the ideal image of the child.</p>
<p>Like Barthes, picture-book critics such as Perry Nodelman (1988), William Moebius (1986), and Joseph Schwarcz (1982) note the sophistication of young readers and the interpellative codes that operate in the most elementary picture books. A board book labels cartoon animals, and a typical counting book provides a 1-2-3 order and a set of quantifiable items. Yet the process of signification in these texts, in a picture book’s sequential narrative, or in the paratext (cover, frontispiece, etc.) of a chapter book, is as complex as any commercial sequence or brand logo. The transmission of an image depends upon a level of clarity for the implied young audience. This is not to say that children’s textual imagery is unmediated or automatically perceived. As children learn to read multimedia sequences of words and pictures, they develop and begin to reproduce the images particular to their cultures. We might say that the iconic peaked-roof house, front lawn, sunshine, and stick-figure family associated with children’s crayon drawings acknowledge a collective Western image of home (and, further, challenge what idealistic thinkers have called the “innocent eye” by suggesting how our subjectivities are interpellated at a young age). Mental images, thought but not necessarily articulated in words or an artistic medium, shape and are shaped by material artifacts, including literary and visual images.</p>
<p>Central images of childhood persist despite changes in sensibility and technology, and despite significant changes in the construction of childhood itself. Nostalgia is a potent force in determining cultural ideals, especially when it comes to infancy and childhood, and anachronistic images can “resurface in new media. . . . Images resemble nomads in that they take residence in one medium after another” (Belting 2005). As a result, critics of children’s literature may operate as iconoclasts or as supporters of favorite collective notions. Jacqueline Rose, in <em>The Case of Peter Pan</em> (1984), argues that the image of childhood is a slippery notion and children’s literature “impossible” as a mode, due to the instability of childhood itself as a collectively held ideal. Anne Higonnet, in <em>Pictures of Innocence</em> (1998), attends to the consumption and construction of childhood through sentimental images from Thomas Gainsborough’s <em>Blue Boy</em>, to John Everett Millais’s <em>A Child’s World </em>(which became a Pears soap advertisement, <em>Bubbles</em>), to Ann Geddes’s photographs of plump babies as flowers. Scholars and mainstream pundits alike lament the marketing of toys, stories, and other commodities for and about children, which helps stabilize a capitalist, corrupted image of childhood on a global level.</p>
<p>Children’s literature itself deploys competing and provocative images of childhood. The visceral image of adventurous childhood posited by Sendak in iconic picture books like <em>In the Night Kitchen </em>(1970, with its famously naked Mickey) and <em>We Are All in the Dumps with Jack and Guy </em>(1993, with its allusions to homelessness and genocide) differs substantially from the image of privileged but solitary Manhattan childhood purveyed by Kay Thompson and Hilary Knight’s “Eloise” books (1955–59, 1999–2001) or the inventive, indulged child of Ian Falconer’s “Olivia” series (2000–present). The Romantic, Anglo-American image of childhood represented in appealing work by Randolph Caldecott, Kate Greenaway, and A. A. Milne is at odds with the pragmatic, equally lively image of racially and ethnically diverse childhood. Texts such as Langston Hughes’s astute <em>The Dream Keeper</em> (1932b) exemplify authors’ attempts to interrogate and provide a corrective to a dominant, oppressive child image. Hughes’s legacy in challenging what Nancy Larrick (1965) called “the all-white world of children’s books”—and its attendant ideal image of a flaxen-haired, blue-eyed, English-speaking child—resonates in the more recent picture books of Allen Say, Faith Ringgold, Christopher Myers, Julius Lester, Ana Juan, and Chris Raschka, as well as in bilingual and international texts.</p>
<p>Of course, the image need not be conjured by a commodity or a political movement. A powerful image of childhood is perpetuated by the professional elementary school teacher, working with young people on a daily basis and concerned with the quality of their education. This image competes with that held by the stay-at-home parent, primarily focused on raising his or her own children. The teacher and parent, in turn, will have differences with the scholar of children’s literature and culture, whose focus is on the critical concept of childhood as well as the sociopolitical status of children at some particular historical period and geographical location. All of the aforementioned share a deep concern for actual children and for the quality of childhood, yet their distinct images of childhood influence their behavior and motivate the opinions they express in their everyday endeavors. Their ideologies around factors like race, ethnicity, class, gender, nationality, and age—influenced by their lifelong encounters with loaded images of childhood and real children alike—are brought to bear upon their praxis, which in turn contributes to popular images of the child, childhood, and children’s literature.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“What was your intention when writing this book?”<br />
“What did you mean by the passage on page 108?”<br />
“What did you want the reader to feel at the end?”<br />
“What message did you intend the book to deliver?”</p>
<p>Authors of novels, especially novels for children, know that questions such as these are not uncommon. This might be surprising, in view of the fact that more than sixty years have gone by since William K. Wimsatt and Monroe C. Beardsley published their famous essay “The Intentional Fallacy” (1946), except that somehow it isn’t surprising at all to find that lengthy and passionate discussion among literary critics has not the slightest influence on the way most readers read most books. Clearly, for many readers, the author’s intention still does matter, and getting it right, or at least not reading against this supposed intention, is an important part of the satisfaction, or perhaps the relief from anxiety, they hope to feel. Recently I answered online a number of questions from readers of <em>His Dark Materials, </em>including this one: “Is a reader ‘allowed’ to have a Christian/religious reading of a text that is supposed to be atheistic?”</p>
<p>What seems to be going on here is the feeling that reading is a sort of test, which the reader passes or fails according to how closely the interpretation matches the one the author intended. It would be easy to criticize or mock this feeling, but it is genuine. It comes from the same source as the indignation readers feel when a text they believed was a truthful memoir turns out to be fiction, and it’s almost certainly related to the anger felt by a child who learns what the rest of the family has known for years, namely that he is adopted. It’s the desire not to be made a fool of: the wish not to be shown up as ignorant of a truth that everyone else knows. In fact, it’s a natural human feeling. People think there really is an answer. I should probably qualify that by saying that it’s young readers, or unsophisticated readers, who seem to be most anxious to know the author’s intention. English literature graduates will have at their fingertips all the arguments about the intentional fallacy, and a dozen other fallacies besides. But do we expect all readers to have that sort of knowledge? It would be absurd. There are plenty of other things for people to be interested in. The question is how we deal with this one.</p>
<p>What I want to examine here is what part intention really plays in the writing of a book, and whether it really helps readers to know what that intention is. Unfortunately, writers are not always trustworthy when they tell us about their intentions. Firstly, they might not remember; secondly, they might not want to reveal their true intentions anyway; thirdly, the context of the question sometimes determines the sort of answer it gets. Questions like this tend to be asked at events such as literary festivals, where the task in hand is that of entertaining an audience rather than revealing deep and complex truths, and faced with that task, the storyteller’s instinct in front of an audience takes over and shapes a few scraps of half-remembered fact and a sprinkle of invention into a coherent and interesting narrative: a story about their intentions.</p>
<p>But they—they? I mean we. I mean I. I, we, and they do that with most questions, especially the old favorite, “Where do you get your ideas from?” We do it because it’s necessary. One of the occupational hazards the modern writer has to negotiate is the book tour, and it’s in the course of such a tour that we have most need of such instant stories about telling a story, because the same questions come up in every interview, at every bookstore, with every audience, twenty, fifty, a hundred times; and in sheer self-defense we develop a performance, with a set of neat anecdotes, one-liners, and pat answers. And one of the consequences of this anti-madness strategy is that our audiences, which consist for the most part of people who like reading but don’t necessarily follow the convolutions of literary theory, come to believe—or are confirmed in an existing belief—that there really is a simple answer to such questions as “What did you intend when you wrote this book?” and that that answer matters to their reading of it.</p>
<p>But here, I hope, I can abandon the pat answers and tell a little more, or as much as I know, anyway, of the truth about my intentions when I wrote one of my books, <em>The Scarecrow and His Servant</em> (2004). The book tells the story of a scarecrow who miraculously comes to life, engages a young boy called Jack as his servant, and wanders about a land that seems to be a sort of fairy-tale Italy. After several adventures, during which they are followed without their knowledge by a lawyer representing the obviously villainous Buffaloni Corporation, they discover that the Scarecrow, thanks to the will that his maker had hidden in his stuffing, is the real owner of a farm in a place called Spring Valley. The Buffaloni Corporation, which had illegally taken possession of the land, is foiled and evicted, and the Scarecrow and his servant live happily ever after.</p>
<p>The story forms a book 230 pages in length, and is illustrated by delicate pen-and-ink drawings by Peter Bailey. I mention that because it was part of my intention to write a story with pictures, and because Peter Bailey had done such delightful illustrations for some of my previous books. So I had his talent in mind from the start, and I intended to write a story that would suit his light and fantastical style.</p>
<p>But as I write those words I know that “intended” should really have been “hoped.” And this is perhaps the first thing to say about writing and intention: intending to write a particular kind of story is not the same sort of thing as intending to rake up the leaves on the lawn, or telephone one’s cousin, or buy a present for one’s grandchild. We know we can do those things. We don’t know we can write a story that will be funny, or moving, or exciting, though we hope we can. All we can honestly intend to do is try.</p>
<p>Then there is the matter of the subject, the characters, and the setting. This is also difficult to explain in terms of intention. I can recall the moment the notion of this story first came to me: it was during a performance of Leonard Bernstein’s <em>Candide</em> (1956) at the National Theatre in London in 1999. I found the relationship between Candide and his servant Cacambo intriguing, and wondered about other such simple master/clever-servant pairs, such as Bertie Wooster and Jeeves. I liked the inbuilt dynamics of the relationship. Did that mean that I <em>intended</em> to write a story about such a pair? Not yet, but the possibility was there. However, the observation struck me with a particular resonance, which I’ve learned means that I probably <em>am</em> going to write about it.</p>
<p>There were two other sources of which I was conscious. One was a book of reproductions of the younger Tiepolo’s lively and brilliant drawings in pen and brown wash of Punchinello. Punchinello, or Pulcinella, was one of the characters in the <em>commedia dell’arte</em>, and whereas the Scarecrow is not Pulcinella, he has this in common with him as well as with the other <em>commedia</em> characters: he is flat and not round. I had found that an absence of psychology in my protagonists was a positive advantage in writing fairy tales of the sort this was going to be, and the sort of intense vivid character embodied in the <em>commedia</em> mask, its reactions instant and predictable and its attempts at subtlety absurdly obvious, was exactly the sort of personality I could already sense developing when I thought of the Scarecrow. Again, it’s impossible to separate what is <em>intention</em> here from what is something else—hope, as I’ve suggested, or simple fascination: here’s a new character to play with. And, of course, the <em>commedia</em> background suggested Italy, and that soon became inseparable from the rest of the idea.</p>
<p>The second source I was aware of was a book of vivid watercolor sketches sent me by a friend, a poet and painter living in Japan, who had become intrigued by the scarecrows Japanese farmers made for their fields. Anything will do: a pink plastic Wellington boot, a toy plane on a string, a doll trailing scores of colored ribbons. They are a riot of improvisation. My friend had sketched dozens of these, and the infinite transmutability of the Japanese scarecrows certainly played a part in one important development of the plot, when the lawyer for the Buffalonis is trying to prove that the Scarecrow in the witness box is not the Scarecrow mentioned in the will, since every single part of him has now been replaced by something else.</p>
<p>But at what point did I intend to make that idea a part of the plot? From the beginning? I don’t think so. I seem to remember I found it with a start of pleasure as I was writing the court scene, but all that might indicate is that my mind had been preparing the way without my being aware of it: that my intention had been unconscious. However, once I had become aware, I could go back and prepare the way by making sure that in the course of each adventure the Scarecrow lost a leg, or an arm, or his clothes, and his servant Jack found a replacement. I definitely remember intending to do that.</p>
<p>In fact it may be that the major decisions are out of our control, and the intentions we’re conscious of are concerned with matters of detail. That certainly goes for what we’re going to write in the first place. I learned a long time ago that it was a mistake to intend, in a calm and rational way, having looked at a range of options and considered their relative merits and drawbacks, to write a certain book rather than another. The part of me that intended to write that particular book wasn’t capable of it, and the part of me that was capable of writing books didn’t want to write that one.</p>
<p>Among those major decisions, the ones that are made for me, is the one about voice and point of view. I couldn’t truthfully say that I “intend” to write in the third person, though I almost invariably do write like that. Nor did I “intend” to make the voice that tells <em>His Dark Materials</em> different in tone from the voice that tells the Sally Lockhart novels, or both of them different from the voice that tells <em>The Scarecrow and His Servant</em> and my other fairy tales, though they are. The voice I found, in each case, seemed to be what the story wanted. And although I think those voices are different, I dare say that if anyone were to perform a stylistic analysis by computer of all my various stories, it would show that I have certain habits and mannerisms that would always give me away, no matter which “voice” I was using; but as I don’t know what they are, I can’t say that I intend anything very much in connection with them.</p>
<p>The aspect of the author’s intention that readers are perhaps most concerned about is the one about “message.” After the first and second volumes of <em>His Dark Materials</em> had been published, but before the third, I was asked many times which of the characters were supposed to be good, and which bad; whom should the readers cheer for, and whom should they boo? They were clearly frustrated by the lack of a clear signal from the author, or the book itself, or the publisher via the blurb, and they felt unmoored, so to speak. The answer I gave was, in effect, “I’m not going to tell you, but the story isn’t over yet. Wait till you’ve read it all, and then decide for yourself. But what are you going to think when someone you’ve taken for a bad character does something good? Or when a good character does something bad? It’s probably better to think about good or bad actions rather than good or bad characters. People are complicated.”</p>
<p>Audiences seemed satisfied with that, and the question faded away; it was seldom asked in that form after the final book was published. But anxiety about religion and morality is particularly sharp in the present age, so variants of that question turn up still, such as the one I quoted earlier: Is it all right to think X, when the book is apparently intended to say Y? What’s the correct view? What’s the right answer? People clearly feel that intention matters a great deal, and that they can trust the author to tell them about it.</p>
<p>The final aspect of “intention” I shall look at here has to do with audience. “What age of reader is this book written for?” is a question that different authors feel differently about. Some are quite happy to say “It’s for sixth and seventh graders,” or “It’s for thirteen and upwards.” Others are decidedly not. In 2008 most publishers of children’s books in the United Kingdom announced that in an attempt to increase sales they were going to put an age-figure on the cover of every book, of the form 5+, 7+, 9+, and so on, to help adult purchasers in nonspecialist bookstores decide whether a particular book would make a suitable present for a particular child. They met a determined resistance from many authors, who felt that their efforts to write books that would welcome readers of a wide age-range were being undermined by their own publishers, and that the age-figure would actively discourage many children from reading books they might otherwise enjoy. The argument continues, but again it shows the problematic nature of “intention.” Does age-guidance of any sort imply that the book is intended for a particular kind of reader? My own view is that the only appropriate verb to use is, again, hope rather than intend. We have no right to expect any audience at all; the idea of sorting our readers out before they’ve even seen the first sentence seems to me presumptuous in the extreme.</p>
<p>To conclude: a writer’s intention with regard to a book is a complicated and elusive matter, and explaining each case truthfully and in full is not always possible. Would a reader want to know that complicated and elusive truth in any case? Would it be any use to them? Possibly, if they were genuinely interested in the process of composition, and prepared for ambiguities and contradictions and uncertainties; probably not, if their desire was for a simple answer that would end their anxiety about whether they’d really understood what the book was saying.</p>
<p>But it would be frivolous to maintain that a writer’s intention doesn’t matter at all. In other spheres of activity it matters a great deal. If we accidentally dislodge a heavy flowerpot from a sixth-floor balcony onto somebody’s head, it’s unfortunate; if we intend to do so, it’s murder. The courts certainly recognize the difference. There is also the related question of responsibility. If a writer produces a story that has the effect of inflaming (for example) racial hatred, can the writer disclaim responsibility by saying that whatever intention he or she had, it wasn’t that, and that in any case the writer’s intention is irrelevant? To disclaim intention and responsibility altogether seems to me to regard the author as little more than an elaborate piece of voice-recognition software, taking down dictation from an unseen source. Of course our intentions matter to some extent: it’s just rather difficult to say what they are.</p>
<p>In practice, the way we answer questions depends on what we judge to be the needs, the age, the maturity, and the intellectual ability of the questioner, as well as the situation in which the question is posed. If we’re lucky enough to have a long line of young customers waiting for us to sign their newly purchased books, we can’t spend much time on any of our answers; with a small group of well-prepared university students in a seminar room, the case is different.</p>
<p>But I think that I would try—that I do try—to explain that what I <em>intended</em> to do was make up as good a story as I could invent, and write it as well as I could manage. And I try to explain something about the democratic nature of reading. I say that whatever my intention might have been when I wrote the book, the meaning doesn’t consist only of my intention. The meaning is what emerges from the interaction between the words I put on the page and the readers’ own minds as they read them. If they’re puzzled, the best thing to do is talk about the book with someone else who’s read it, and let meanings emerge from the conversation, democratically. I’m willing to take part in such conversations, because I too have read the book, and if I’m asked about my intentions, then any answer I give will be part of the conversation too; but it’s hard to persuade readers that my reading has no more final authority than theirs.</p>
<p>In that way, I may not clarify much for people who want to know about my intentions, but I do introduce the idea of reader-response theory, which is probably more helpful.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>As a proper noun, “Latino” designates a resident of the United States who is of Latin American descent. As an adjective, it renders the noun that it modifies somehow pertinent to or associated with such individuals.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a proper noun, “Latino” designates a resident of the United States who is of Latin American descent. As an adjective, it renders the noun that it modifies somehow pertinent to or associated with such individuals. While the <em>Oxford English Dictionary </em>traces the first use of the label back to the 1940s, it did not gain widespread currency until the 1980s. As Suzanne Oboler (1995) observes, “Latino” emerged as a counter to “Hispanic,” an umbrella term resented by many who fell into its fold as “an artifact created and imposed by state administrative agencies.” Among other things, “Hispanic” implicitly cleaned up the genealogy of the individuals it subsumed by privileging Spanish descent and disarticulating Latin American origins. The insistence on “Latino” over “Hispanic” that proliferated in the 1980s thus emanated from a desire for self-signification as well as a desire to recuperate a connection to Latin America. Moreover, as Felix Padilla (1985) explains in one of the first (and best) discussions of the emergence, function, and efficacy of “Latino” as a politicized identity category, the moniker has enabled the mobilization of diverse ethnic, cultural, and national groups into an imagined community predicated not just on linguistic and hemispheric affiliations, but also on shared experiences in the United States with racism, poverty, and other social challenges.</p>
<p>As “Latino” came into use in the 1980s, it quickly became supplanted by “Latino/a” and “Latina/o,” both of which offered to correct the gendered implications of “Latino.” In Spanish, an <em>–o</em> ending, which serves as the default form for adjectives and adjectival nouns, renders a term masculine, while an <em>–a</em> ending renders it feminine. Since default references to “Latino literature” or “Latinos in Hollywood” discursively overlook and exclude women while alleging to accommodate them, the utilization of “Latino/a” or “Latina/o,” which are more explicitly inclusive, has become more commonplace. In an effort to circumvent the politics (and messiness) of “Latino” versus “Latino/a” versus “Latina/o,” “Latin@” has recently come into use in some sectors, though this concoction can certainly be parsed and problematized, too.</p>
<p>While the terminology has been a hotly contested matter with an array of cultural, political, and personal stakes (Gimenez 1993; Hayes-Bautista and Chapa 1987; Oboler 1995; Chabram-Dernersesian 2003), it is not surprising that it has been handled in different—if not inconsistent—ways in children’s literature. As might be expected, one encounters in criticism and reviews published in the 1970s and 1980s recurring references to “Hispanics” and “Hispanic Americans” as well as some mention of “Spanish Americans” (Madsen and Wickersham 1980; Adams 1981). Although this earlier research’s use of “Hispanic” evokes the aforementioned issues, and references to “Spanish Americans” perpetuate the inaccurate and fundamentally racist reduction of ethnic identity to language, it is nonetheless sensitive to the portrayals of Latinos/as in children’s books as well as to their relative invisibility in the literature available at the time. Notably, one also finds in this earlier period—most prominently in the groundbreaking <em>Interracial Books for Children Bulletin</em>—an emergent swerve away from generic labels through specific attention to representations of Chicanos and Puerto Ricans (Council on Interracial Books for Children 1972; Council on Interracial Books for Children 1975; Freundlich 1980).</p>
<p>In more recent years, terminology has remained an unresolved issue: the titles of conference papers, research articles, reference books, and dissertations continue to waver in their negotiation of “Hispanic,” “Latino,” and “Latino/a.” For many researchers and critics, “Hispanic” continues to serve as a conveniently generic and familiar descriptor (Gillespie et al. 1994; Nilsson 2005). Arlene Barry (1998) explains, “[B]ecause U.S. government institutions, such as the Bureau of the Census, use <em>Hispanic</em>, I thought it might be more widely recognized and would help to avoid confusion.” Yet another contentious dimension of “Hispanic” becomes apparent when Barry adds that she prefers the label because “it places more of an emphasis on integration.” Generally, however, researchers today prefer “Latino/a” and “Latina/o” due to greater awareness of the assorted problems with “Hispanic” and the gendered implications of “Latino” (Day 1997; Medina and Enciso 2002; Chappell and Faltis 2007). Not to be overlooked, of course, is the fact that it is becoming increasingly more common for researchers to abandon generic labels altogether and, in the vein of the aforementioned <em>Interracial Books for Children Bulletin</em>, to particularize their discussions according to the specific ethnic and cultural ties of the authors under discussion and/or the experiences being depicted.</p>
<p>As occurs with the descriptor “African American,” the application of “Latino/a” to children’s literature raises a series of questions. In the simplest sense, “Latino/a children’s literature” refers to literature for children by Latino/a authors that often portrays and speaks to Latino experiences. Works such as <em>How Tía Lola Came to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Visit</span> Stay</em> (2001) by Dominican American writer Julia Alvarez and <em>Friends from the Other Side </em>(1993) by Chicana legend Gloria Anzaldúa thus easily fit into the category. The parameters of the category must become more flexible, however, when one considers works by authors of mixed backgrounds, including Pam Muñoz Ryan and Matt de la Peña. There is also the matter of books such as <em>We Are Chicano </em>(1973) by Rose Blue and <em>A Day’s Work </em>(1994) by Eve Bunting, which depict Latino/a characters and experiences but are written by non-Latino/a authors. To be sure, cases can be made both for and against the inclusion of these texts in the category. Among others, Alma Flor Ada (2003) acknowledges the trickiness of this issue. Ultimately, Ada makes an overture toward literary merit, but she quickly qualifies it when she cautions, “The merit of a book is determined not by the heritage of the author or illustrator, but by their intention, knowledge, sensitivity, responsibility, and artistry. . . . Yet there is an inner look to a culture that is not easily acquired and requires long contact with people of the culture and its environment. The deep experiences of a people can seldom be told authentically from the outside.” At the very least, the hesitancy in Ada’s comment—which should not be taken as the definitive statement on the matter—throws into relief some of the challenges and stakes involved in conceiving of Latino/a children’s literature.</p>
<p>Publishers and booksellers have certainly added to the lack of consensus about which terms are preferred, accurate, and politically correct by organizing their own categories of literature for children variously around “Hispanic,” “Hispanic American,” “Latino,” “Latino/a,” and even “Latin American.” In different venues, one finds <em>Talking with Mother Earth / Hablando con Madre Tierra </em>(2006) by Jorge Argueta (a Pipil Nahua Indian from El Salvador who now lives in San Francisco) classified as “Latino,” “Latino &amp; Hispanic,” or, by virtue of its bilingual content, simply (and very unhelpfully) “bilingual.” Although in some cases more specific descriptors such as “Mexican American,” “Chicano/a,” and “Dominican American” have been utilized, largely the institution and promulgation of the more general categories has been a result of publishers and booksellers commodifying multiculturalism and making shopping for multicultural fare as convenient (i.e., as uncomplicated and obvious) as possible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, inasmuch as categories such as “Hispanic children’s literature” and “Latino/a children’s literature” readily signify diversity for consumers seeking to broaden children’s reading experiences, these categories actually “hide more than they reveal” (Gimenez 1993). On one hand, they obfuscate the specific cultural content and context of a text (assuming it has specific cultural content and context in the first place); on the other, they perpetuate indifference toward the diverse ethnic identities and cultural formations that terms such as “Hispanic” and “Latino/a” actually encompass. Within the children’s literature subcategory of “Latino &amp; Hispanic,” Amazon.com lists among the top results Spanish-language translations of Margaret Wise Brown’s <em>Goodnight, Moon</em> (1947, trans. 1995) and Esphyr Slobodkina’s <em>Caps for Sale</em> (1940, trans. 1995). But to consider Spanish-language editions of classic books “Latino &amp; Hispanic” alongside books that specifically reflect, represent, and speak to Latino/a experiences is a fraught proposition that radically dilutes the category. Elsewhere, the website of Lee and Low Books, a publisher distinguished for its multicultural offerings, describes as “Latino/Hispanic/Mexican Interest” works such as Lulu Delacre’s <em>Arrorró, mi niño: Latino Lullabies and Gentle Games</em> (2004), Pat Mora’s <em>Confetti: Poems for Children</em> (1996), and Alexis O’Neil’s <em>Estela’s Swap</em> (2002). Such a grouping again renders the category of “Latino/Hispanic/Mexican Interest” a broad and slippery one. Besides the fact that the three authors hail from different ethnic backgrounds, their texts fit their shared billing in overly general ways. Delacre’s book promises to be a collection of “Latino lullabies,” but the deployment of “Latino” in this instance completely undoes what the label has come to mean: as a modifier, it suggests that, as in the case of “Latino literature” or “Latino film,” the lullabies are products of individuals or cultural formations based in the United States that have ties to Latin America. In actuality, the lullabies have been culled from throughout Latin America. Given the origins of the songs and games featured in the book, a more proper subtitle would be <em>Lullabies and Gentle Games from Latin America</em>.</p>
<p>Once Delacre’s book is triangulated with Mora’s and O’Neill’s, additional questions arise about the parameters of and criteria for the “Hispanic/Latino/Mexican Interest” designation. That Delacre is a native of Puerto Rico, Mora is Mexican American, and O’Neill is not of Latin American descent invites the usual question as to whether an author’s ethnic background should determine whether her book merits the “Hispanic/Latino” tag (which, to be sure, carries a certain capital within the current marketplace of children’s literature). More worthy of attention and concern are the textual and narrative elements that render the three texts “Hispanic/Latino,” including the incorporation of Spanish (to different degrees), the integration of a few culturally specific references, the deployment of many more culturally indeterminate references, and illustrations that feature distinctively brown bodies. As these kinds of elements come to serve as a shorthand for “Latino/Hispanic/Mexican Interest,” they reflect and reify a broader slippage in the popular American imagination and media in which “Latinos are perceived primarily in terms of assumed patterns of cultural behavior, of stereotypes reinforced by vaguely defined and ahistorical interpretations of the meaning of ‘Hispanic ethnicity’” (Oboler 1995).</p>
<p>Although many books for children play into the homogenizing, essentializing effects of popular labels by reenacting Latino/a ethnocultural indeterminacy (Soto 1995; Rodríguez 1999; De Anda 2004; Herrera 2004; Pinkney 2007), many others defy such complicity by featuring specific ethnocultural contexts. In <em>The Rainbow Tulip</em> (1999), Pat Mora smoothly establishes that the family in the story is of Mexican origin, while René Colato Laínez makes it clear in <em>I Am René, the Boy / Soy René, el Niño</em> (2005) that the narrator has come to the United States from El Salvador. One refreshing example is the <em>Sports</em> volume of the Latino Life nonfiction series published in the mid-1990s by Rourke Publications. In spite of the series’ name and broad chapter titles such as “Latinos in Baseball,” the author of the <em>Sports </em>(1995) installment, Jeffrey Jensen, is careful to identify the ethnic background of each individual that he profiles. As in the books of Mora and Laínez, Jensen’s gestures toward specificity offer to interrupt popular tendencies (including that of his own publisher) to lump Latinos/as into a homogenous ethnocultural bloc.</p>
<p>Since the very convenience of terms such as “Hispanic,” “Latino,” and even “Latino/a” is the root of the problem with them, it behooves scholars, teachers, librarians, and consumers to understand these terms as superficial descriptors and not as signifiers of a homogenous ethnocultural formation. Rubrics such as “Hispanic children’s literature” and “Latino/a children’s literature” encompass too easily a spectrum of unique texts that embody diverse and distinctive mixtures of cultural, historical, political, and artistic specificity, influence, and significance. Attending to the distinguishing characteristics of texts that otherwise tend to get grouped together—either because of convenience or because the texts lend themselves to it—can yield more nuanced understandings that reveal the limits of the terms upon which popular categories turn.</p>
