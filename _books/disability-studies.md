*Keywords for Disability Studies* aims to broaden and define the conceptual framework of disability studies for readers and practitioners in the field and beyond. The volume engages some of the most pressing debates of our time, such as prenatal testing, euthanasia, accessibility in public transportation and the workplace, post-traumatic stress, and questions about the beginning and end of life.

An invaluable resource for students and scholars alike, *Keywords for Disability Studies* brings the debates that have often remained internal to disability studies into a wider field of critical discourse, providing opportunities for fresh theoretical considerations of the fieldâ€™s core presuppositions through a variety of disciplinary perspectives.
