				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Abolition is most narrowly defined as the end of slavery. But in African American studies, abolition is a keyword that raises a complex set of questions about when, and whether, slavery actually ended. As a concept, then, abolition raises critical questions about black temporality—­what shifts in relations of power constitute freedom’s beginning and captivity’s end? Scholars within African American studies have considered the complexity of abolition as a process; while recognizing the dramatic transformations that emancipation wrought, theorists have challenged its interpretation as grand event, questioned its completeness, and demanded abolition’s continued salience for challenging regimes of antiblack captivity. For black studies, abolition means far more than an end but rather a struggle over the terms of the future. From the perspective of the enslaved, abolition meant, at least in part, the reconstitution of relations of property. Abolition is tethered to political and social arrangements outside of regimes of racial and gendered violence and normativity that were inaugurated under slavery. As a site of black studies analysis, abolition offers a rejoinder to linear and triumphant narratives about the history of slavery.</p>
<p>Some analyses of abolition have emphasized its intellectual history; the 1831 inception of William Lloyd Garrison’s the Liberator looms large in the historiography of abolition as studies have examined distinctions between Garrisonian, evangelical, and political abolitionists; abolition’s role within feminist thought and activism is also particularly significant, as historians have identified antislavery activism as foundational to women’s rights organizing and have debated the role of racism in the abolitionist and subsequent suffrage movements (E. DuBois 1978; Kraditor 1981; B. Aptheker 1982; Cott 1987; Yellin 1989; Newman 1999). Importantly, Rosalyn Terborg-­Penn demonstrated that “Black women fought racism and sexism simultaneously” in their struggle for abolition and suffrage (1998, 6). Recent work has emphasized a long abolition framework (Sinha 2016, 5), with some scholars emphasizing its centrality to the founding of the American republic, interpreting the Revolutionary War as a revolt to maintain a slave-­owning economy that was vigorously challenged by Africans in the colonies (Horne 2014).</p>
<p>There are at least two historical developments that we could consider within the long abolition framework, including the movement of free and enslaved black people to define abolition in terms of immediacy rather than gradualism (Quarles 1970; Sinha 2016) and the literary canon of abolitionist essays, poems, and narratives by formerly enslaved men and women, which date from the mid-­eighteenth century through the Civil War years; most influential among them are works by Phyllis Wheatley (1773), Olaudah Equiano (1789), Mary Prince (1831), Frederick Douglass (1845), William Wells Brown (1847), Henry Bibb (1849), Sojourner Truth (1850), Solomon Northup (1853), Charles Ball (1858), William Craft (1860), Harriet Jacobs (1861). Writing against the denunciations and “frightful liabilities” associated with the word “abolitionist” (Douglass [1845] 2009, 98), these narratives collectively provide a foundation for interpreting its meaning, although the words “abolition” and “abolish” appear only sparsely in the texts. Charles T. Davis and Henry Louis Gates surmised that almost half of the black literary canon was produced by enslaved or formerly enslaved authors (1985, xv). This intellectual landscape, along with speeches and post-­1865 memoirs and interviews from the formerly enslaved, constituted the abolition movement’s most powerful political weapon and continues to generate monumental theorizations of subjectivity, violence, resistance, power, refusal, agency, democracy, capital, objectification, commodification, geography, and performance, grounding scholarship in a range of black studies subfields: political theory, English, history, gender studies, performance studies, and cultural studies.</p>
<p>The field of black studies has emphasized the ways in which the Emancipation Proclamation did not yield the economic and political freedom about which so many captives dreamed. Eric Williams ([1944] 2014) and Cedric Robinson ([1983] 2000) have traced the capitalist interests embedded in abolition. Williams argued that abolition could not simply be read as progress; he asserted that it was also a matter of capitalist expediency, a turning point on which industrial capitalism in the British Empire depended, since “commercial capitalism of the eighteenth century developed the wealth of Europe by means of slavery and monopoly. But in doing so it helped to create the industrial capitalism of the nineteenth century, which turned round and destroyed the power of commercial capitalism, slavery, and all its works” (210). The precise relationship between slavery and capitalism in the U.S. context continues to be historicized and debated (Harris [1982] 1993a; W. Johnson 2013; Baptist 2014; Beckert 2014). As this debate extends to abolition, one historian concludes, “if slavery is capitalism, as the currently fashionable historical interpretation has it, the movement to abolish it is, at the very least, its obverse” (Sinha 2016, 3). Put another way, slavery’s grand alchemy—­the transformation of persons into property—­required both physical and social violence (Smallwood 2007); black abolitionists’ ongoing project would be to attack the nexus of violence, extraction, and speculation that gave racial capitalism its form and content.</p>
<p>The economy of slavery was gendered: domestic labor sustained the plantation household and enslaved workers, and black women’s capacity to biologically reproduce slave labor was integral to the system (Morgan 2004). Therefore, critical expansive analyses of abolition attend to the significance of gendered racial capitalism as well as the gendered contours of abolitionist practice (A. Davis 1971b; J. Jones 1985; Hine 1994; Hunter 1997; D. White [1985] 1999; Painter 2002; Morgan 2004; Camp 2004; Glymph 2008; Weinbaum 2013; Fuentes 2016; Hartman 2016; Ivy 2016; Owens 2017). W. E. B. Du Bois challenged dominant white historiographic accounts of abolition by centering black male soldiers as heroic agents whose presence in the Union army constituted a decisive “withdrawal and bestowal” of labor that “decided the war” ([1935] 1998, 57). Yet, as Saidiya Hartman asks, “Where does the impossible domestic fit into the general strike? What is the text of her insurgency and the genre of her refusal?” (2016, 171). Such questions remain pressing, potentially transforming the meaning of abolition.</p>
<p>Abolitionist struggle has taken place over myriad terrains that exceed the nineteenth-­century battlefield and congressional hall and extend to the sites of black women’s “war for freedom”: the field, the cabin, the street, the rural countryside, the contraband camp. Neither “soldiers nor citizens,” enslaved women’s “struggle for emancipation—­their political history—­fits no state narrative, Union or Confederate” (Glymph 2013, 497; McCurry 2010, 9); they became “outlaws and insurrectionists,” in order to achieve abolition (Glymph 2013, 490). Under the rubric of black feminist history and theory, then, the abolitionist occupies the position of outlaw, situating law as a production of black unfreedom, striving to dismantle rather than renovate or reclaim the American house of bondage. In the United States and beyond, black women’s emancipation acts took the form of deadly encounters in bondage on slave ships; insubordination; surreptitious provision of aid from within the space of the plantation; quotidian work as nurses, cooks, and seamstresses for Union forces; daily labors to dismantle the plantation household as the nucleus of the slave system; and complex labor negotiations to undermine plantation productivity. Yet these forms of resistance, refusal, and sabotage are often underacknowledged (Glymph 2008, 95; Saville 1994; Schwalm 1997; Camp 2004; McCurry 2010; Weinbaum 2013; Bell 2016; Mustakeem 2016). Black women enacted abolition by refusing the gendered racial terror that reproduced the slave system, rendering them sex slaves and breeders. The posting of abolitionist newspapers in slave cabins by enslaved mothers, sisters, and grandmothers counts as abolitionist study and planning; moments, minutes, days, and months of truancy that black women spent in temporary flight from plantation counts as abolitionist time (Camp 2014), as does the “seasonal pattern” of Harriet Tubman’s thirteen trips extricating men, women, and children from slavery (Clinton 2004, 86; Clifford Larson 2004). Black women’s labor for abolition, like their subsequent domestic work, would be exempted from the protection of law, as military articles shielding black men who enlisted in the Union army did not apply to them (Glymph 2013). Instead, the Militia Act of 1862 prescribed marriage and motherhood as the only path to freedom, effectively erecting an “unequal two-­tiered system of emancipation” (Hunter 2017, 172); this disregarded the waged and unwaged labor black women performed for the Union army and instead configured emancipation in terms of gendered dependency. Rendering themselves ungovernable on the plantation, black women were a distinct category of criminal when they fled during war years. As fugitives, they traversed a terrifying landscape of possible injury and execution at every stage of flight during the Civil War. Despite their significant labor for the federal military, the emancipating army extended the vagaries of slavery, subjecting “contraband” black women to sexual assault as well as deleterious discourses about their burdensomeness and licentiousness (D. White [1985] 1999; J. Jones 1985; Schwalm 1997). With black women absconding with their labor power and resisting the forces that continued to terrorize them in the Union, these subtle and extravagant confrontations force scholars to reckon with the gendered meanings of abolition under capitalism and nationalist militarism.</p>
<p>Alongside historical analyses that explore the piracy, strikes, revolts, commons creation (Roane 2017), and marronage (N. Roberts 2015) that constituted abolition’s political ground, its temporal terrain remains a critical object of black studies scholarship. Indeed, the field is haunted by the question, to what extent is abolition a matter of the past? How do we grapple with the significance of these grand and mundane black events in the context of both dramatic change and continuity, the “nonevent of emancipation insinuated by the perpetuation of the plantation system and the refiguration of subjection” (Hartman 1997, 116). The “endings that are not over” (A. Gordon 1997, 139) haunt the afterimage (K. Brown 2015) and “afterlife of slavery” (Hartman 2007) manifesting in the unresolved and unredressable “fundamental familiar violence” and “multiple subjections” that Christina Sharpe calls “monstrous intimacies,” “which not only perdure, but are inflicted anew,” vexing triumphant progress narratives (Sharpe 2010, 2; Hartman 2002, 758). Abolition mandates a “fully loaded cost accounting” of slavery, its immediate economic afterlife in white-­supremacist contract dominion and indebted obligation (Painter 2002, 16; Hartman 1997; Stanley 1998) and black captivity (Daniel 1990; Lichtenstein 1996; Mancini 1996; M. Curtin 2000; K. Gross 2006; Blackmon 2008; Hicks 2010; Perkinson 2010; Childs 2015; LeFlouria 2015; Haley 2016), and the ongoing ravages of racial capitalism, gendered antiblack violence, and captivity. As Hartman argues, “if the ghost of slavery still haunts our present, it is because we are still looking for an exit from the prison” (2007, 133, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Abolition’s temporality is the present continuous—­the tense of a project that is ongoing and incomplete. It is also the subjunctive—­the expression of what might be, what could have been, desire. As a concept, abolition addresses the vexing entanglements of past, present, and future; it insists on necessary transformations yet to be actualized. Indeed, both Hartman and Du Bois theorize black futurity through a mode of looking. In the chapter of Black Reconstruction titled “Looking Forward,” which follows “Looking Backward,” Du Bois defines abolition democracy as one of “two theories of the future that clashed and bended just after the civil war: the one was abolition-­democracy based on freedom, intelligence, and power for all men; the other was industry for private profit directed by an autocracy determined at any price to amass wealth and power” ([1935] 1998, 182). The relationship between the Thirteenth Amendment and abolition was murky from the moment of its passage, as “even the abolitionist movement could not decide whether the Amendment was an end or a beginning” (Foner 1988, 67). Its passage inaugurated a debate within the American Anti-­Slavery Society, with Garrison calling for the organization’s disbanding in triumph and Douglass and Wendell Phillips successfully insisting that they move forward with suffrage as its goal. The late nineteenth century witnessed continuing black delineations of the meaning of freedom through resistance to violence and monumental assertions of economic, political, and social autonomy (Hunter 1997; Schwalm 1997; Rosen 2009; Hahn 2003).</p>
<p>The ongoing project of abolition is reflected in efforts to dismantle prisons. Angela Davis elaborates abolition’s historical limitations to elucidate its future potential; abolition’s nineteenth-­century incarnation was “primarily a negative process of tearing down” and as such failed to create “an array of social institutions that would begin to solve the problems that set people on the track to prison,” creating the condition of possibility for the carceral state (2005, 96). Abolition looks to render obsolete the prison as a structure of racism that enshrines the inequality that capitalism requires (R. Gilmore 2007, 28; R. Gilmore 2015). Analyzing the prison as a savage response to late-­capitalist crises of surplus (R. Gilmore 2007), many scholars and activists have come to see abolition as an Afrofuturist alternative. Abolition is employed in black studies as a theory and practice through which to conceptualize the unraveling of material conditions of crisis, abandonment, and dispossession that the prison regime (including its manifestations in surveillance, detention, monitoring, policing) professes to resolve but in fact proliferates. Thus, abolition offers a radical critique of state violence (Berger, Kaba, and Stein 2017), rejecting prevailing notions that the policing and prison systems are merely broken but fixable (Kaba 2015) and proposals to refurbish what is fundamentally a mortal enclosure; to do so would amount to renovating a “fatal machine” that entrenches racial hierarchy (Herzing 2015, 194).</p>
<p>Abolition’s twentieth-­century theoretical development emerges from within the fatal machine. For the imprisoned intellectual and activist George Jackson (1972), the prison was an enclosure of capital and the repression of dissent. Those who were waging an antiprison movement from the inside developed a radical prison praxis, situating the prison as a central “constitutive logic” and a practice of domination and control (Rodríguez 2006, 40). Jackson, Angela Y. Davis, Assata Shakur, and Mumia Abu-­Jamal are among a host of influential imprisoned and formerly imprisoned intellectuals whose analyses falls within the framework of radical prison praxis and the genre of neoslave/neoabolitionist narrative (Joy James 2005). Although imprisoned and nonimprisoned intellectuals of the civil rights and Black Power movements were more inclined to use the language of revolution than abolition, they nonetheless contended that “America itself was a prison,” arguing for an expansive view of the object that needed to be dismantled (Berger 2014, 51).</p>
<p>America’s carceral inheritance and inherence belie predominant claims that prisons produce safety. Abolitionist thought elaborates the myriad ways that the prison is a center of imperial tyranny (Rodríguez 2007) and fascism (B. Aptheker 1971). Foundational abolitionist analyses have challenged the proliferation of carceral language and deconstructed carceral categories such as “corrections,” “inmate,” “safety,” “innocence,” “guilt,” and “criminal,” among others; abolition offers a critique of narrow rights and inclusion frameworks exposing the “deadly consequences of making rights contingent on innocence” (Kandaswamy 2016; PREAP [1976] 2005); in the nineteenth century, enslaved women’s myriad labors for freedom were part of what made the Civil War a crisis for established gender relations and identities, and contemporary abolitionist analyses seek to throw gender normativity into crisis (Whites 1995). Abolition incorporates a critique of the heteronormative and white-­supremacist notions of gender and sexuality that slavery instantiated and that carceral discourses and modes of policing and containment have reproduced and entrenched (A. Davis 1971b; Spillers 1987); this critique identifies and elaborates the myriad forms of gendered and sexual insurgency that take place in opposition to surveillance and from within jails and prisons (Sudbury 2005; Kunzel 2008; Hicks 2010; Mogul, Ritchie, and Whitlock 2011; Dillon 2012; Richie 2012; Spade, Stanley, and Queer Injustice 2012; Spade 2013; Shabazz 2015; Stanley and Smith 2015; Haley 2016; McDonald and Tinsley 2017).</p>
<p>Abolition as a refusal of racialized gender normativity builds on black feminist analyses of violence and political economy by positing a future beyond gendered racial terror and racial capitalist modes of social reproduction. Davis’s 1971 “Reflections on the Black Women’s Role in the Community of Slaves” centers the home as a site of slavery’s terror and abolitionist insurgency, situating domestic work “as a source of not only individual but also community sustenance and resistance” (Weinbaum 2013, 449), thereby providing a confrontation with the archive and a bold reassessment of the role of both enslaved women’s activism and racialized regimes of gendering that is extended in groundbreaking work that followed (Finch 2015; Lightfoot 2015; Millward 2015; Mustakeem 2016; Fuentes 2016; Ivy 2016; Owens 2017).</p>
<p>In the 1970s, movements supporting black women including Dessie Woods and Joan Little, who were criminalized for defending themselves against racial terror, played a “catalytic role” in the development what Emily Thuma calls “anticarceral feminism,” placing the elimination of gender violence at the center of historical and contemporary abolition analyses (Thuma 2015, 66; A. Davis 1971b, 1975). This framework is central for twenty-­first-­century black feminist defense campaigns that seek to free women who have been criminalized for surviving gender violence (Love and Protect / Survived and Punished). This intellectual and activist history shapes the contours of abolition’s central project—­the eradication of the prison as a necessary facet of societal reordering based on institutions of life sustainment (health, employment, the environment, education, housing) rather than violent enclosures that increasingly exceed U.S. national borders (Meiners 2007, 2016; Loyd, Mitchelson, and Burridge 2012; Schept 2015; Sojoyner 2016). Although prison expansionists increasingly label prisons as service apparatuses for women (Braz 2006), in reality prisons impose gendered forms of harm, diverting resources from child care, health care, housing, and guaranteed income, among other programs. By the end of the twentieth century, U.S. spending on punishment outpaced its allocations for welfare grants by the billions (Kohler-­Hausmann 2017, 1).</p>
<p>Incarceration negates these institutions, as funding that would otherwise be used for social programs is allocated toward imprisonment. As Dorothy Roberts contends, the American legal system is rooted in the “monstrous combination of racial and gender domination” that manifested itself in reproductive terror (1997, 23). The policing of black homes, forced carceral labor for social reproduction inside prisons, and discourses of black female deviance represent facets of the prison regime that abolitionist feminism challenges. Late-­capitalist law-­and-­order logics proliferate individualism and privatization as preeminent moral values that rationalize mass imprisonment by criminalizing the precarious.</p>
<p>Integral to abolitionist thought and activism, then, is the theoretical contribution of black feminist history and theory, which has centered reproductive violence, gender violence, and the exploitation of socially reproductive labor as technologies of captivity and argued for the necessity of alternatives. Central to prison abolition is an emphasis on structural over individual causes of societal harm (PREAP [1976] 2005). Black feminist analysis has situated economic dispossession as racialized and gendered violence and has also insisted on alternative modes of accountability for gendered violence (Baker and Cooke 1935; Beale [1970] 2010; A. Davis 1971b; Tillmon 1972; Hunter 1997; D. Roberts 1997; Incite!/Critical Resistance 2014; Nadasen 2005; Orleck 2005; Kornbluh 2007; Gore 2011; Kim 2011–­12; Ocen 2012; Willoughby-­Herard 2016; Hartman 2016). Such interventions offer a reconceptualization of sociality and forms of community accountability in the face of injury that do not fortify structures of oppression (Bierria, Kim, and Rojas 2011–­12). The black feminist black commons, then, is the future toward which abolition looks</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The word “apartheid,” translated literally from Afrikaans as “apartness,” has often existed in a dynamic tension between its ability to describe a particular sociohistorical experience in South Africa and its usefulness as an organizing concept that describes the convergence of settler colonialism and global capital. As a method of inquiry, black studies has been at the forefront of rethinking the notion of apartheid as exceptional, drawing parallels between the formation of racial capitalism in South Africa and elsewhere throughout the African diaspora (Bunche 1992; Vinson 2012; P. Andrews 2014).</p>
<p>Apartheid did not emerge suddenly with the election of the National Party government in South Africa in 1948. Instead, it was a culmination of a number of policies of colonial capitalism that emerged from the very founding of South Africa as a Dutch colonial outpost in 1652. Forms of residential segregation, land expropriation, and labor manipulation were a prominent feature of the colonial project in South Africa that predated the rise of the National Party. Colonial authorities took great pains to destroy independent African political economies, turning African leadership into proxies for colonial authority while expropriating land. With the passage of the Native Lands Act of 1913, only 13 percent of South Africa’s land was left in black hands. Over time, black South Africans were reconfigured into an available labor pool for white capital (Bundy 1979).</p>
<p>Population segregation and control of black labor mobility was key to the ideology of apartheid and can be categorized as taking two forms: petty and grand. Petty apartheid typically described the laws of everyday segregation, with every imaginable detail of daily life legislated on the basis of race. Grand apartheid was based on the idea that black South Africans were citizens not of South Africa but instead of the “homelands” artificially created by the National Party government. These homelands corresponded with the 13 percent of land “reserved” for black South Africans by the Native Lands Act of 1913. Grand apartheid ideology officially stripped black South Africans of South African citizenship. As foreign citizens, they were required to possess documentation to prove their right to reside in South Africa—­hence the pass laws functioned as a system that managed black migration. Ideally, each homeland (many of which were made up of noncontiguous strips of unproductive and/or overpopulated land) would be granted independence. However, with no political economy independent of South Africa, such independence was primarily symbolic. Instead, the ideology of grand apartheid meant that the apartheid state had no responsibility to provide for its majority black citizenry and that it would effectively determine the terms through which black South Africans could participate in the economy. While the Native Lands Act began the process of creating black South Africans as cheap labor surplus, the policy of grand apartheid took this economic policy to its logical conclusion. Hence, while everyday segregation (petty apartheid) was a key component of apartheid policy, it was in fact secondary to the need to control and manipulate the availability and price and black labor. In order to accommodate the policy of grand apartheid, an estimated three and a half million black South Africans were internally displaced (C. Walker 2008).</p>
<p>Resistance to settler colonialism preexisted the birth of apartheid and took numerous forms, ranging from violent rebellion to political organizing (Mangcu 2012; Odendaal 1984). However, with the increasing violence of colonial law and bureaucracy, a new sense of urgency caused black South Africans to organize in a more united manner, culminating in the formation of the South African Native National Congress (later the African National Congress, or ANC) in 1912. Previous to the formation of the ANC, much of the work of resisting the colonial-­apartheid state had been organized locally and along the lines of ethnicity. This newer form of organizing and resistance worked to unify black South Africans across ethnicity and increasingly encouraged the political identity of blackness (A. Marx 1998; Biko 2002). In this sense, Black South Africans began to participate in global black conversations regarding self determination, liberty, and identity. These conversations led black South Africans to identify with and organize around forms of global black consciousness even as they remained attuned to the particularities of their experience in South Africa. Examples of these kinds of cross-­Atlantic dialogues included correspondence between W. E. B. Du Bois and Sol Plaatje, a founder of the ANC whose Native Life in South Africa was partly influenced by his increasing engagement in Pan-­Africanism. Freedom for blacks in South Africa was thus linked to global black freedom movements. As blacks won additional rights in the West, and African and Caribbean countries gained their independence, apartheid stood as the last remaining vestige of a system of legalized racial colonialism for black populations, whose demise was inaugurated by the Haitian Revolution.</p>
<p>Initial political organizing was reformist, seeking to engage colonial authorities and stem against the loss of various privileges (particularly land ownership and voting rights) that the black elites had previously enjoyed. However, even the most piecemeal reforms were a threat to the system of racial capitalism and were met with systemic violence from the colonial and later apartheid state, along with the erosion of the few political and economic rights black people did possess. The intensification of policies already begun by the colonial state under the guise of National Party apartheid rule called for a more confrontational and radical response politically. In disagreement with the ANC, the PAC (Pan Africanist Congress) was born. Members of the PAC felt that the ANC was too focused on civil rights and integration and co-­optation into the existing system. While they defined the idea of the African politically rather than racially, they were also clear that to be African meant accepting African majority rule and control of the political economy.</p>
<p>The Sharpeville Massacre of 1960 represented a watershed moment in resistance to apartheid. In the protest against pass laws organized by the newly formed PAC, thousands of black South Africans had gathered peacefully at the local police station. They were met with extreme violence from the South African police force, resulting in sixty-­six deaths. In the political unrest that followed, the National Party government outlawed black political parties (particularly the ANC and PAC), imprisoned (and later assassinated) black political leaders, and drove the rest of black political leadership into exile. The violent response from the National Party government convinced black political leadership that a purely nonviolent response to apartheid was insufficient, and both of the main black liberation parties began to mobilize militarily. The level of violence occurred almost simultaneously with political independence and majority black rule elsewhere on the continent, bringing renewed attention to the injustices of apartheid. South Africa began to be seen as a pariah state, and an international antiapartheid movement, sympathetic to the plight of black South Africans, gained visibility. This international movement drew from and in many ways also overshadowed the critique of apartheid that emerged out of Pan-­African, Third World, and civil rights movements operating in the global black world (Nesbitt 2004).</p>
<p>Apartheid itself was not a monolith, and the National Party government was finding it increasingly difficult to navigate the competing interests of various different forms of white capital. On the one hand, extractive and export-­focused industries (such as mining), along with racial ideologues, desired an entrenchment of the apartheid policy. On the other hand, internal commercial interests were invested in creating a consuming black middle class. The growth of economic prosperity among black South Africans was simultaneously a threat to and an opportunity for white capital, and the National Party government often implemented the policy of apartheid while simultaneously investing in (unequal and inadequate) urban infrastructure for black South Africans. Contradiction, then, was at the heart of the policy, as the very thing apartheid was designed to prevent (a literate, urban-­based black political body) was increasingly visible in the cities of South Africa.</p>
<p>Perhaps in an effort to control and manage competing anxieties about the presence of permanent black urban populations, the National Party regime introduced Afrikaans-­only instruction in government schools for the black populace. While this is often cited as the reason for the 1976 Soweto uprisings, Afrikaans education was simply one of several grievances of black South African students. Once again, peaceful demonstration was met with disproportionate violent response by the apartheid regime. In the months that followed, a number of student rebellions around the country began to coalesce in a reinvigorated internal antiapartheid movement. While the international apartheid movement (particularly the work of exiled activists) is often highlighted, internal political movements were key to making the costs of continuing apartheid untenable for the National Party government. The internal battles between competing classes of white hegemony saw neoliberal, pragmatic technocrats within the National Party emerge victorious, and their first order of business was to repair South Africa’s international image, demobilize black rebellion, and make South Africa stable for global capital (Bond 2000).</p>
<p>The ANC was tasked as the coalition partner best suited to help the National Party government manage its negotiated settlement and give it international legitimacy. While the ANC did have a great deal of local support, it was also the case that much of its leadership was either jailed or in exile, hence disconnected from everyday struggles in communities. Imposing a top-­down approach, the ANC was tasked with demobilizing black insurgency and substituting representative democracy for participatory democracy. The ANC positioned itself as the sole inheritor of the liberation struggle and quickly moved to convert itself from a liberation movement to manager of the South African body politic. The postapartheid state, now led by the black majority government symbolized by the ANC, would be the benevolent patriarch doling out beneficence as well as appropriate punishment to its citizen-­children.</p>
<p>The negotiated settlement left much of the economic basis of apartheid intact, now exacerbated under the yoke of neoliberal economic orthodoxy (Desai 2002). Ironically for many black South Africans, they had survived apartheid only to be ushered into new forms of unfreedom, made perhaps all the more insidious by their supposed nonracial nature and the fact of black political control of the state apparatus. Exactly how and to what end black political leadership uses its control of the state is the unanswered question of contemporary South African politics. Is it that the capture of the state does not matter, or is it that once state capture occurs, the political imagination must be more expansive? Observers have noted that the ANC government has acted less in the interests of the black majority and more as a contemporary form of indirect rule, ensuring that the conditions remain safe for exploitative global capital. In 2012, striking miners in Marikana were met with the single deadliest use of police force on South African civilians since the Sharpeville Massacre. The display of violence shocked the nation and led some critics to suggest that Marikana represented an end to the naivete of South African exceptionalism. In other words, South Africa’s problems were not particular to apartheid and its aftermath; instead its problems were symptomatic of the challenges faced by many contemporary capitalist-­oriented governments.</p>
<p>If we situate apartheid within a larger conversation of black studies, we can see how it was never the case that South Africa was exceptional. Perhaps the forms of racial capital and bureaucratic excess used to produce and manage South Africa were more extreme, but certainly historical and contemporary examinations suggest important corollaries. The insights of postcolonial studies and indigenous studies are also key in helping to rethink the Americas as settler colonies and to reveal the continuity between colonial administration in South Africa and the rest of the African continent (Mamdani 1996). As a result, it might be useful to think about apartheid both as a specific form of racial capitalism implemented in South Africa and as a general idea that speaks to racialized forms of control and management of subject populations. This general idea has probably had its most controversial application in relationship to Israel, and the term “Israeli apartheid” has been adopted by scholars and activists to describe the contemporary Israeli-­Palestinian political economy (U. Davis 1987).</p>
<p>Since 2000, the negotiated settlement of postapartheid South Africa has started to fray. Various different forms of citizen rebellion have emerged, ranging from demands for services to more recent demonstrations by university students against exorbitant fees and insufficient financial aid. While a small black elite enriches themselves, financial control of South Africa remains disproportionately in the hands of white South Africans. For those black South Africans not able to join the new middle classes or the nouveau riche, they find themselves living in a society more economically unequal than during the years of apartheid. As South Africans ask questions about how they arrived at this political juncture and what they should do to end vast economic inequality structured by race, it is worth remembering that racial capitalism and its attendant forms of management are global concerns that plague much of the black world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If one is going to think about the Black Arts Movement (BAM) as a set of keywords, it is important to consider the component words separately, as well as how they work together in describing the black radical cultural movement of the 1960s and 1970s that was inextricably linked to Black Power. That is not simply a question of defining the denotative meanings of “Black,” “Arts,” and “Movement” but also of the qualities of those words in how they combine during the Black Power / Black Arts moment.</p>
<p>No doubt “black” is defined elsewhere in this volume and does not need extended treatment here. However, it is worth noting, as John Bracey Jr. does (2014), that when “black” as a term of identification and solidarity was increasingly deployed, largely through the influence of Malcolm X, it was to a considerable extent a gesture of opposition, of rejection, of rebellion, that needed a more elaborated positive content. In other words, what did it mean to be black? One way of looking at the Black Arts Movement is as a sort of investigation of what it meant to be black, of what was the basic cultural, spiritual, and intellectual material of blackness as a move toward freedom and self-­determination. It is safe to say that no absolute consensus or definitive conclusion was reached; but the question was asked, and definitions and representations were proposed.</p>
<p>Then there is the word “Arts.” What happens to this word when it is brought into conjunction with “Black”? Why is it plural as opposed to the title of the poet, playwright, critic, and playwright Amiri Baraka’s poem “Black Art,” which was in many respects a sort of poetic manifesto for the incipient movement? Of course, there is the inverting play on the notion of “black arts” as a timeworn phrase in English denoting evil magic. But it is also proposing a vision of art that is fundamentally at odds with what might be thought canonical notions of European and Euro-­American “high art” with hierarchal notions of rigidly separated artistic genres and media, of popular and serious, of middlebrow and avant-­garde, with similarly discrete structures of interpretation and valuation (e.g., literary critics, theater critics, music critics, art critics).</p>
<p>Many people proposed the need for a “Black Aesthetic,” that is, a fundamentally black system of interpretation and evaluation in which art could be criticized, understood, judged, and, ultimately, created, either in opposition to or outside a dominant white aesthetic system pretending to be universal and designed as a tool of domination. Considerably before Foucault’s thought circulated widely in the United States, BAM / Black Power activists understood “aesthetics” as a sort of discourse in the service of power. However, it is also fair to say, as in many other areas of BAM, that there was no real agreement about what a “Black Aesthetic” might entail. Rather, there were a considerable number of possibilities or arguments presented. Probably the fundamental cleavage was between those, particularly many influenced by Maulana Karenga’s Kawaida philosophy, who favored what might be thought of as a neo-­African avant-­garde or vanguard aesthetics, based on some visionary notion of African tradition that rejected both African American popular culture, particularly the blues and various sorts of music influenced by the blues, and much African culture of the colonial and immediate postcolonial eras, and those who saw African American popular culture, especially the blues, R&amp;B, and soul, as part of a long black tradition that would be the bedrock of any revolutionary black culture. In practice, as always with BAM, this divide was complicated and often contradictory. Some of the people most influenced by Karenga, notably Amiri Baraka, were among the strongest proponents of black popular culture, especially music, as an essential part of black identity and any emerging liberated black nation.</p>
<p>However, despite this divide, one thing that united most participants in BAM is an approach to “the arts” that broke down traditional notions of medium and genre. For example, how does one understand the 1967 mural of Chicago’s Organization of Black American Culture (OBAC) Visual Arts Workshop, The Wall of Respect, in 1967, a work that was key in the growth of the black mural movement of the 1960s and 1970s? One might be tempted simply to consider it in the medium of painting. However, the artists of the workshop included the text of Baraka’s poem “SOS,” photographs, and more traditionally painted portraits of black political and cultural figures in a variety of styles that also displayed a certain resistance to traditional notions of unity of composition. Certainly, earlier African American visual artists (and non–­African American artists) worked with texts. However, The Wall of Respect in Chicago was unusual in that it was substantially a visual piece in which the text was at the center of the work. Did the Baraka poem frame the mural and give it its central meaning? Was the mural in many respects a sort of illustration of the poem? Did the mural remind viewers of the visuality of written poetry? Did the poem bring orality into what is not usually thought of as a sonic medium? Again, the answers to these questions, which might be a series of yeses, highlight the challenge to white academic notions of canon and artistic classification that BAM presented.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the creation and reception of The Wall of Respect was an intentionally public display of even more varied combinations of media and genres. As the artists worked on the various sections of the mural, there were often performances of poetry, theater, music, and/or dance as the residents of Chicago’s South Side watched—­and sometimes joined in to one degree or another. The most intense moment of such crossings of media and genres was no doubt the dedication of the mural on August 27, 1967. The dedication featured dance, music, poetry (including a performance by Gwendolyn Brooks and Haki Madhubuti), political speeches, and other sorts of performances. Police sharpshooters were stationed on the rooftops of nearby buildings, heightening the sense of the moment as a sort of theater of the real. The site of the mural continued to be a place for political events, including a large community rally led by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in 1967, until the destruction of the mural in 1973. In short, The Wall of Respect and the other sorts of collaborative work it engendered embodied the sort of crossings that made BAM aesthetics and actual practice in poetry, fiction, theater, music, dance, and visual arts (to the degree that these can be distinguished in BAM) a hybrid of the “Arts” that reached a mass audience and influenced what might be thought of as hip hop aesthetics that famously drew on different genres and media (poetry, popular music, dance, visual art, film and video, and so on) in a way that was eclectic and yet centered in African American expressive culture and experience. In this sense, a direct line could be drawn from The Wall of Respect to the video version of Beyoncé’s Lemonade (2016), among other works.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the word “Movement.” In the case of BAM, it has at least a dual meaning. First, there is a notion of a cultural movement in the sense of Romanticism, Surrealism, Dadaism, the Harlem or New Negro Renaissance, the Chicago Renaissance, the Irish Renaissance, the Beats, and so on. Generally, these are groupings of fairly like-­minded artists whose networks grew out of social circles, shared aesthetic concerns, geographical proximity, “racial” or “national” identity, and/or sociopolitical interests. There is also the political sense of “movement” as in the abolitionist movement, the March on Washington Movement, the Popular Front, and the civil rights movement that coalesced around a social issue or set of social issues (e.g., the fight against chattel slavery, the struggle again Jim Crow segregation, and the opposition to fascism in the 1930s). Of course, all these political movements had their cultural or artistic component, but in all they were primarily interested in doing political work.</p>
<p>BAM, then, was unusual, especially for the United States, in the sense that it formed a more seamless whole with the Black Power movement than was probably the case with the relationship between any other artistic and political movements in the history of the United States, even the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s and the black Chicago Renaissance in the 1930s and 1940s, which both had their radical political sides. That is to say that if one wanted to describe the Black Arts Movement as the cultural wing of the Black Power movement, one could just as easily describe the Black Power movement as the political wing of BAM. One thing that characterized Black Power, by and large, was the conviction that culture and the arts were central to both the white domination of black people (and the world) and to the creation of a new revolutionary people/nation. One could not change the political system if one ignored the cultural. Again, it is true that the nature and base of what the emergent revolutionary black nation consisted (or would consist) of was much debated and that to a large degree how one saw the answer to this question shaped one’s politics, but culture and the arts were key to most visions of liberation proposed by Black Power. Similarly, BAM activists (who, like Amiri Baraka, were often among the foremost leaders of Black Power) saw the imperative of engaging the mass of black people (and connecting with masses of people struggling for liberation around the globe) and moving them to change the world. In that sense, BAM was both a popular and vanguard political and a cultural movement at the same time. BAM artists did not simply propose, as did many previous and subsequent bohemias and avant-­gardes, to engage a comparatively small number of hip people in coffeehouses, clubs, small galleries, and so on (and, in the age-­old contradiction of bohemia, have their work commodified into cool artifacts for wealthy patrons hungry for the newest thing, eventually finding their way into mass celebrity in consumer culture) but to draw black people into revolutionary arts/art practices that, as the New Orleans BAM / Black Power activist Kalamu ya Salaam wrote, “do not necessarily be like / anything you heard before &amp; / yet it will still sound familiar” (1972, 378).</p>
<p>When BAM is thought of in its individual verbal components as well as in their combination, it is a movement and ideological and aesthetic approach. That approach is all about being a material force in the world, changing the world (including the crucial task of how one interprets one’s self and one’s peers in the world, which is the province of culture and cultural analysis), internationalism, cultural/political self-­determination (including, again, judging one’s self by one’s own standards, not those of the oppressor), pushing the envelope politically and culturally yet in a way that engages rather than alienates the mass of black people, that is popular yet cutting edge or radical at the same time, and that is by the people, for the people, of the people, and (in an important material addendum to the familiar Lincolnesque trio) supported by the people’s money and other resources in public arts projects. The notions of a “public sector” of art supported by public funding (as opposed to private patrons), of art that is both radical and popular (as seen in Beyoncé’s Lemonade and Li’l Wayne’s “God Bless Amerika,” to give a couple of twenty-­first-­century examples), that breaks down the barriers between traditional notions of genre and media in “serious” art, may seem like standard operating procedure in the twenty-­first century, influencing the sense of what art is, what art is for, what it can and should say about the world, and how it reaches an audience (to whom it belongs, really) of virtually everyone in the United States. However, this was not always the case, certainly not the case before BAM and Black Power. So in the final analysis, the “Black Arts Movement” is a key set of words or a phrase that recalls a particular cultural and political moment, but it is also an enduring, if controversial, legacy and political-­cultural sensibility or stance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Black Freedom Movement is a distinct era in the African American struggle for civil and human rights that began in the mid-­1940s with a surge in public protest and ended in the mid-­1970s with a shift in emphasis toward electoral politics. It encompasses two of the most unique and enduring periods of black activism. The first is the civil rights movement, which resulted in the elimination of Jim Crow laws in the South and the upending of Jim Crow customs in the North. The second is the Black Power movement, which not only expanded on the gains of the civil rights movement but also elevated African American racial consciousness, forever changing what it meant to be black.</p>
<p>The three words that compose the phrase “Black Freedom Movement” reflect the term’s core characteristics. “Black” speaks not only to the racial identity of the vast majority of the Black Freedom Movement’s participants—­the black masses—­but also to the race of its leaders. African American activists, from black preachers to black community organizers, led the Black Freedom Movement by marshaling the energy and resources of the black community. “Freedom,” meanwhile, addresses the Black Freedom Movement’s wide-­ranging goals, which included both civil rights objectives, such as securing the right to vote, and human rights aims, such as access to decent housing. And “Movement” marks that moment as a time when black protest coalesced into a genuine social movement, with generally agreed-­on ideological frameworks, strategies, tactics, and aspirations.</p>
<p>For generations, African Americans have described their struggle for justice and equality in language reflective of the Black Freedom Movement’s chief characteristics. They have regularly used racial signifiers when naming their organizations. In the 1830s, they routinely included some derivation of “colored” when identifying their political conventions. When they came together in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1835, for instance, they called their gathering the National Convention of Free People of Colour. They have often identified freedom as their overarching goal. During slavery, black abolitionists such as David Walker argued for a literal freedom from bondage, and enslaved rebels such as Nat Turner took up arms toward this end. And immediately after emancipation, they demanded their freedom rights, insisting on living as free men and women. Indeed, freedom has always been an integral part of African Americans’ protest lexicon. During the height of the Black Freedom Movement, for instance, black activists called their protest music “freedom songs,” dubbed their parallel educational institutions “freedom schools,” and named their independent political organizations “freedom parties.” African Americans have also tended to label heightened periods of protest, such as the Back-­to-­Africa crusade of Marcus Garvey’s era, “movements.”</p>
<p>In the 1950s, however, black moderates led a decided shift away from using racial signifiers to define and/or describe the struggle. Their influence was far reaching. In 1955, black activists in Montgomery, Alabama, for example, opted to omit racial signifiers when they formed the Montgomery Improvement Association to coordinate the local bus boycott. And a year later, when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his coterie of advisers came together to launch the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, they too adopted the new practice.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the same contingent of moderate black leaders led a sharp move away from identifying freedom as a primary protest goal. Instead, they framed the struggle exclusively as a fight for civil rights, narrowing the focus of protest to securing only those rights guaranteed by government. In publicly jettisoning freedom as a goal, they obscured and at times ignored long-­standing human rights objectives.</p>
<p>These changes were a direct response to Cold War domestic politics. As tensions escalated between the United States and the Soviet Union, federal and state officials began cracking down with increasing ferocity on organizations that challenged the status quo. NAACP leaders Walter White and Roy Wilkins, among many others, feared the political and financial consequences of being red-­baited. In response, they rebranded the struggle, reframing it as a civil rights movement, phrasing they believed would be more palatable to whites. Liberal whites latched onto the term, helping it become the dominant descriptor of black protest.</p>
<p>The changes in terminology were never fully embraced by African Americans at the grassroots. Local people continued to invoke freedom when naming their groups. In Mississippi, for example, when voting rights activists formed a statewide umbrella organization to coordinate voter registration efforts, they called it the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. At the same time, local people continued to frame their struggle as more than a fight for civil rights. In Lowndes County, Alabama, for instance, when black residents established a countywide movement organization in 1965, they named it the Lowndes County Christian Movement for Human Rights. And by the late 1960s, racial signifiers had returned. Taking a cue from Lowndes County activists, Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale named their new movement organization the Black Panther Party for Self-­Defense. The resurgence of the once familiar practice of incorporating race in movement naming practices was an explicit rejection of Cold War colorblindness and a full embrace of the long history of racial self-­identification. And the tendency was not limited to the grassroots. When African American professionals organized, they almost always included “black” in the names of their organizations, such as the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Black Social Workers.</p>
<p>The renaissance of old naming practices and descriptors of black protest did not keep scholars from using the more narrowly constructed catchall phrase “civil rights movement” to describe the work of African American activists. But some scholars, especially those who had taken part in the movement, began pushing back against the vague colorblind nomenclature. In the early 1980s, the historian Clayborne Carson was one of several academics who pointed out the numerous inadequacies of the term “civil rights movement.” In an essay titled “Civil Rights Reform and the Black Freedom Struggle” (1986), Carson argued that “use of the term civil rights movement, rather than such alternatives as black freedom struggle, reflects the misleading assumption that the black insurgencies of the 1950s and 1960s were part of a coordinated national campaign . . . rather than a locally-­based social movement” (23). “In reality,” he said, “these local protest movements involved thousands of protesters, including large numbers of working class blacks, and local organizers who were more concerned with local issues, including employment opportunities and political power, than with achieving national legislation” (23–­24). Carson further explained, “Rather than remaining within the ideological confines of the integrationism or King’s Christian-­Gandhianism, the local movements displayed a wide range of ideologies and proto-­ideologies, involving militant racial or class consciousness” (24). For Carson and an increasing number of scholars, historical accuracy required the terms “black” and “freedom” be used to describe 1960s-­era black protest.</p>
<p>Since Carson’s essay, scholars studying black protest from a black perspective have made the important distinction between a struggle and a movement. For many, “struggle” is an umbrella term that captures the broad contours of the African American fight against white supremacy and for racial justice and equality. It includes the many moments in the African American journey from slavery to freedom when black protest rose to the level of a genuine social movement, such as the abolitionist movement, Back-­to-­Africa movement, and the Black Power movement. “Movement,” on the other hand, refers specifically to those more precise moments of black protest, such as the period from the 1940s through the 1970s, when African American activists came together around a common set of concrete goals, shared a similar approach to change, and organized and mobilized the black masses to challenge the status quo.</p>
<p>By definition, the Black Freedom Struggle is chronologically broad. It stretches from the colonial era, starting with the efforts of the first enslaved Africans to gain their freedom, to the present day, with the Movement for Black Lives. But temporal boundaries are essential to making sense of the start, evolution, and end of social movements. By necessity, then, the Black Freedom Movement is time bound. Pinning its beginning and ending to precise chronological moments connects it to concrete historical forces and developments, such as World War II in the 1940s and the surge in the number of black elected officials in the 1970s. It enables charting the Black Freedom Movement’s trajectory and decoding its development. And it makes identifying the factors most responsible for the Black Freedom Movement’s demise possible.</p>
<p>Significantly, the chronological specificity central to the Black Freedom Movement in some ways affirms the narrower periodization of the normative civil rights movement framework, which places the movement’s beginning in 1954 with the U.S. Supreme Court school-­desegregation ruling in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas and locates its end in 1965 with the passage of the Voting Rights Act or a few years later, in 1968, with the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But there are critical differences.</p>
<p>First, the Black Freedom Movement does not decontextualize midcentury black activism, pretending as though it was far and away the most important manifestation of black protest. Instead, it locates the activism of the era on the continuum of black protest that stretches both backward and forward in time and constitutes the Black Freedom Struggle. Second, it balances top-­down with bottom-­up approaches to understanding black protest. Whereas the civil rights movement conceptualization tends to focus on government actors, especially presidents and federal judges, as well as national leaders such as Dr. King, the Black Freedom Movement retrieves everyday people and grassroots activists from the margins of analysis. And third, it treats Black Power protest as a logical extension of earlier forms of black agitation, rather than as an ill-­advised break from the past.</p>
<p>The Black Freedom Movement framework also expands understanding of black protest. Ever since civil rights became the dominant lens through which to view 1960s-­era black activism, the strategies and tactics used by black activists have been too narrowly configured. Most notably, nonviolence, as both a philosophical approach and a tactic, has been made the standard of black protest, against which all other approaches and activities are measured. While nonviolence enjoyed unprecedented popularity among African American activists during this time—­indeed, the unusually high level of interest in nonviolence was a defining characteristic of the era—­only a handful of black leaders, Dr. King foremost among them, embraced nonviolence philosophically as a way of life. Many more accepted nonviolent direct action as a useful tactic given the circumstances. But even more than that rejected it wholesale, choosing instead to continue long-­standing African American traditions of self-­defense and parallel institution building. Rather than focus wholly or substantially on nonviolence, the Black Freedom Movement properly contextualizes nonviolence, putting it alongside and in conversation with the many other forms of black protest.</p>
<p>The Black Freedom Movement framework has gained widespread acceptance among scholars who study black protest from an African American perspective. But its influence has not been limited to them. Its critique of the broad civil rights movement construct has encouraged scholars who have adhered to this mode of analysis to reconsider its underlying suppositions. For the southern historian Jacquelyn Dowd Hall (2005), this meant pushing the starting point of 1960s-­era black protest back into the 1930s, to a time when white labor organizers, scattered about the South, found common cause with black workers and activists. It also meant emphasizing the movement’s economic objectives.</p>
<p>But Hall’s “Long Civil Rights Movement” contradicts the Black Freedom Movement in several important ways. Foremost, it decenters African Americans, giving primacy instead to whites. In the Long Civil Rights Movement, the starting point is essentially the moment when white labor organizers realize that their success is tied directly to, and in many ways wholly dependent on, the success of black activists on the factory floor and beyond. In addition, it credits white labor organizers with injecting an economic agenda into the Black Freedom Struggle, ignoring the black impulse for economic justice that had taken countless forms since emancipation, including the effort by black unions such as the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters to win recognition and collective bargaining rights. At the same time, it posits that the shift away from workplace organizing during the 1950s stemmed from the withdrawal of white labor organizers from the movement, rather than being a pragmatic response to shifting political opportunities brought about by the onset of the Cold War. And finally, it treats the Black Power movement much as civil rights traditionalists have, as a dramatic and unfortunate break from the usual forms of black protest</p>
<p>.<br />
The Long Civil Rights Movement has resonated within the academy in large part because it allows scholars whose work intersects only secondarily, or even just tangentially, with the Black Freedom Struggle to claim close association with black protest. But proponents of the Black Freedom Movement have pushed back. The historians Sundiata Keita Cha-­Jua and Clarence Lang, for example, offered a biting critique of its shortcomings in “The ‘Long Movement’ as Vampire: Temporal and Spatial Fallacies in Recent Black Freedom Studies” in the Journal of African American History in 2007. And Black Freedom Movement scholars have vociferously pointed out its merits and shortcomings at national conferences, including at the ninety-­eighth meeting of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History in 2013.</p>
<p>But the debate surrounding the Long Civil Rights Movement is almost entirely academic, confined to the pages of historical journals and monographs and to roundtables at professional gatherings. Indeed, the public is almost wholly unaware of the disagreements between advocates of the Black Freedom Movement and proponents of the Long Civil Rights Movement. In fact, nonacademics barely know these conceptualizations exist. For most people, the dominant framework for understanding 1960s-­era black protest is still the civil rights movement. To be sure, the Black Freedom Movement, as an idea and a term, has made real inroads into the public square, reflected most notably in spaces dedicated to historic preservation, including the Smithsonian Institution’s new National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, DC. But even spaces that have embraced the Black Freedom Movement fully, such as the National Civil Rights Museum at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, which centered its five-­year, $25 million exhibit redesign and renovation around the Black Freedom Movement, find it hard to shed the civil rights movement moniker.</p>
<p>The inability of the Black Freedom Movement to dislodge the civil rights movement is not simply a function of the latter being deeply ingrained in people’s minds. The problem is that the civil rights movement reinforces a set of false assumptions about racial progress in America that many whites find comforting and reassuring. Among other things, they cling to the notion that racial discrimination in the South was the fault of only a handful of southern hayseeds and that racial discrimination in the North was simply an unintended consequence of colorblind public policy. These ideas permit whites to put a great distance between themselves and the past—­that was then and that was them. In this way, they avoid confronting the harsh realities of history. The Black Freedom Movement, on the other hand, draws the past near, rendering plainly visible the ways the past is present. Indeed, while the civil rights movement eases the conscience, the Black Freedom Movement challenges it.<br />
It is highly unlikely that Black Freedom Movement will replace the broader civil rights movement framework anytime soon. The public’s attachment to the older way of understanding black protest runs too deep. However, among academicians who study black protest from a black perspective, that shift has already occurred. In fact, the Black Freedom Movement has been the driving force behind the very best scholarship on 1960s-­era black protest since the 1990s. Although it may still be a while, all signs indicate that “Black Freedom Movement” will one day roll off the tongues of the public as easily as “civil rights movement” does today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blackness is enthusiastic social vision, given in (non)performance, as the surrealization of space and time, the inseparability of gravity and matter, fabric’s fabrication, field’s feel, rub’s rub, plain’s chant, an endlessly ante-­inaugural endlessness of means, an empillowed, haptically ham-­boned coinstrumentality of care, in caressive sound and anachoreographic sounding. Anticipating originary correction with self-­defensive division and (re)collection, it goes way back, long before the violent norm, as an impure informality to come. Its open and initiatory counterpleasures reveal the internal, public resource of our common sense/s, where flavorful touch is all bound up with falling into the general antagonistic embrace. That autonomous song and dance is our intellectual descent; it neither opposes nor follows from dissent but, rather, gives it a chance. Consent to that submergence is terrible and beautiful. Moreover, the apparent (racial) exclusivity of the (under)privilege of claiming this dis/ability serially impairs—­though it can never foreclose—­the discovery that the priority of sovereign regulation is false. In order to get the plain sense of this, you have to use your imagination against the world, since in the world—­that dream, that nightmare of dominion, overview, and oversight—­blackness comes sharply into relief against its negation. On the ground, in the field, in the plain, it doesn’t come into relief at all, really, but as a mode of sensuous theoretical practice, it celebrates against predatory and incorporative worldliness, whose primary weapon is the imposition of the desire for worldliness. Blackness, lived both as the denial of and the incapacity for worldliness, is properly understood as constraint when constraint is improperly understood as undesirable, as a radical undesirability in the face of the belligerent fantasy of the freedom of, or of freedom in, the world. Blackness, in and as a kind of fleeting, prior persistence, resists these bad thoughts. It’s the good trip before the bad trip that good trips can induce. Blackness is midnight blue as midnight comes again.</p>
<p>If it seems like blackness shows up most clearly against the backdrop of its negation, perhaps this is because affirmations of it—­out of the bloody constraint that makes them necessary—­are often given as if a claim on property. And yet it is impossible to think it without the making of a claim, though the claim is an effect of a triple dispossession—­the giving away of what was never ours, the theft from us of that same thing, and the refusal to take that shit as given. But all this is just to say that same thing is anything but. It’s everything but, never the same, must change, and if that imperative implies sameness, it’s only because our language, our naming, is inadequate to what is irreducible in the name when the name is irreducible in what is irreducible to the name. Only in a certain profligacy of naming, a terrible and beautiful festival of predication, is something approached—­as Ed Roberson (1970) and, then, Aldon Nielsen (1997) show—­through the various calligraphies of black chant. Deeper still, the thing we share is not a thing, and though we share it, it is not ours. We share it in our practice of it, which is a plain of commonness in work and play. Constrained to show no restraint, trained in the refusal of training, our interminable refrain is, “I’m serious as a heart attack. I’m just playing.”</p>
<p>Our thing, which ain’t no thing, which is absolutely nothing, is real, though any isolated instance or aspect of it that is put forward as the real thing ain’t. Often thought to be a thing of darkness, it is, more gloriously, more severely, a thing of nothingness. In this regard, being everything in being nothing; it’s not a thing, not anything at all but, rather, that shared practice of sharing, that simplest explosion of an absolutely complex simplicity, that we have sometimes thought of under the rubric of the gift, that sometimes we think by way of the concept of the given, but whose materiality is most precisely imagined in giving. On the cusp where generosity and generativity converge, it proffers convergence as a general and inescapable blur. Often thought to be a property of certain bodies or the troublesome property of that troublesome property that stands in, without standing, for the theft of body, as such theft’s victim and effect, it is more beautifully, more terribly, an openness of flesh, a monstrosity to be claimed, as Hortense Spillers (1987) proclaims—­an animated, animaterial showing, an empathic and emphatic refusal of body and mind, of self in relation to world, all of which have been refused to it as a matter of law and custom, science and philosophy. Blackness is (the improvisational sociology of) quantum sociality. Blackness is the old-­new math.</p>
<p>Blackness bears the history of the epidermalization of the alternative. The alternative bears that history in turn, will never not be black, now, whatever else that irreducible and inexhaustible blackness is, or will be. Whenever a cop busts a guy in the head, our busted head is model and precedent. The police were called into being to come get us. Their constantly coming to get us—­“Shade! Good God! It’s a raid!”—­shapes the way we shift our shape. He always be killing us, and we are constrained to survive that (W. Brown [1847] 1970). He’s tight grilled. If his situation ain’t improvin’, he try’n to murder everything movin’ (Jay-­Z 1998). He imposes improvement on everything that moves. He tries to use everything until it’s all used up, but, giving nothing, all he does is (lay) waste, throwing shells everywhere. Part of what we are is the imperative to see him clearly, to look into the argon of his eyes, finally, so we can see that we are not there. The analysis of our murderer, and of our murder, is so we can see we are not murdered. We survive. And then, as we catch a sudden glimpse of ourselves, we shudder. For we are shattered. Nothing survives. The nothingness we share is all that’s real. That’s what we come out to show. That showing is, or ought to be, our constant study.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We often take our bodies for granted, as if they were self-­evident and as if to think or talk about them was a matter of obvious description. But there is nothing “natural” about the ways we perceive our bodies, and there are many ways to approach the term. What a body means in relation to other bodies and to the world around it has taken shape and shifted meaning through the languages of science, philosophy, politics, and history. Nowhere is this more graphically illustrated than in the ways we understand race, sex, and gender, terms that determine who we are and where we rank in the social structures of the modern world. In African American studies, the term “body” takes on a particular resonance as it is used to draw attention to the visceral nature of racism as well as the physical forms of African Americans’ resilience and resistance.</p>
<p>Scientific discourses in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were made up of elaborate systems of classification and categorization. Natural scientists such as Johannes Blumenbach and Carl Linneaus drew up detailed hierarchical systems to define and rank the races. These categories, meant to be taken as scientific fact, were descriptions of not only physiognomy but also temperament. Race was considered as much a matter of behavior and intellectual capacity as it was skin color or appearance. In accordance with the hierarchical dichotomy between body and mind, articulated by René Descartes, the European race was associated with the mind and its capabilities, while the African race was associated with the body and its workings. In <em>Systema Naturae</em> (first published in 1758), the Swedish natural scientist Carl Linnaeus attributed five races to humankind. He described the <em>Europeanus</em> (European) variety as gentle, acute and inventive,” while the <em>Africanus</em> (African) variety was described as black, phlegmatic, relaxed, . . . crafty, indolent and negligent (Linnaei 1758, 21). In “Geographical Basis of History,” the philosopher Georg Hegel claimed that the northern European races shaped history, while the sub-­Saharan African was incapable of “realiz[ing] his own being” ([1837] 1899, 93). The white races, from the northern climates, were the creators of civilization, while “the Negro” remained incapable of all historical change.</p>
<p>Race and sex were intertwined as categories used to assess the body. African women were considered hypersexual and excessively fecund. They were used most often as proof that Africans were closer to animals than to humans. In 1774, Edward Long, a British colonial administrator in Jamaica, asserted that there was an “intimate connexion and consanguinity” between blacks and orangutans (370). In 1817, the physician Georges Cuvier wrote his observations of an autopsy conducted on a Khoi Khoi woman named Saartjie Baartman. Like many indigenous peoples, Baartman had been brought to Europe and her body put on display as a living example of the hypersexuality of primitive races. Cuvier’s observations of Baartman’s genitalia were used as examples of deviant female sexual anatomy. Her brain, genitalia, skeleton, and body cast were kept at the Musée de l’homme in Paris until 2002.<br />
What would come to be called “scientific racism” hardened during the period of nineteenth-­century chattel slavery, particularly in the United States. The now-­discredited fields of craniology (the study and classification of the skull) and phrenology (the study of the brain) were developed to support the idea of European intellectual superiority. Africans and those of African descent were designated as lower on the evolutionary scale. Prominent men of science argued against Charles Darwin’s support of the thesis that all humans were descended from the same species (monogenesis) and insisted that the lower races must have different origins (polygenesis). In popular science, black people were governed by their senses, drives, and appetites, which they were unable to control or restrain. They were therefore incapable of self-­government and in need of constant guidance.</p>
<p>After slavery, black people were further criminalized on biological grounds. The Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso’s influential theory of “criminal atavism” reflected the common sentiment of the time. He asserted that criminal tendencies were inherited and that they could be identified by physical traits likened to primitive man. His assessment of the physical features of white prostitutes in <em>The Prostitute and the</em> <em>Normal Woman</em> (Lombroso and Ferrero 1893) argued that their criminal proclivities could be identified by their physical likeness to women of primitive races, particularly the Hottentot (Gilman 1985, 226). Black bodies were therefore marked as criminal by biology. They were not capable of being rehabilitated, only contained. The “facts” of race, sex, and class continue to shape the ways black and gendered bodies are perceived and underlie the violent forms of control and punishment black people are still subjected to.</p>
<p>Approaches to how we understand our physical selves have also been proposed by philosophers and theorists. “The body,” as an isolated unit of investigation, comes out of poststructuralist theory of the 1980s and 1990s. The proliferation of scholarly work on “the body” established it as a theoretical category. According to poststructuralist theory, systems of knowledge produce their object, and the body is therefore only knowable as a discursive field, historically inscribed by discourses in the natural sciences, medicine, philosophy, and political theory. The French theorist Michel Foucault’s influential delineation of the term “biopolitics” showed that political power regulates human life on the level of the biological body (1978, 139). Using seventeenth-­century through nineteenth-­century France as his archive, he argued that the use of power shifted from that of the sovereign over his subjects to a system in which forms of discipline, surveillance, and control are exerted on the body by institutions including the prison system, medicine, education, and the military. But Foucault’s theories, as they do not adequately consider the institutions of slavery and colonialism, are insufficient in their reach to account for the specific forms of biopower exercised on racialized people’s bodies. Black people, with bodies that are deemed inherently and biologically deviant, are not subjects that can be disciplined into some sort of obedience. Instead they are to be contained and surveilled, held in a permanent “state of injury,” or killed (Mbembe 2003, 21). Angela Davis’s work on the prison industrial complex critiques Foucault’s ideas of the prison as a reform (1998, 96–­106). Foucault (1977, 2003) argued that the system of biopolitics replaced physical punishment, but attention to racialized regimes of power show that systems of violence persisted and continue to circumscribe black lives. The practice of lynching in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the sterilization practices that continued into the 1970s, the levels of police brutality experienced by black people in the United States, and the development of the prison industrial complex as an institution meant to contain and control black people show the insufficiency of Foucault’s universalist theories of the body.</p>
<p>Studies of the body also took on particular force in feminist theory. Feminist theories challenged the idea of a universal body and critiqued many poststructuralist theories for assuming the European male as a normative subject in their analyses. Feminist theory showed gender to be a product of discursive regimes and that these regimes legitimated the supposed inferiority of women. The American theorist Judith Butler introduced the powerful concept of performativity as a way to understand the production of gender itself. In her influential book <em>Gender Trouble</em> (1990), Butler argues that repetitive collective enactments, based in discursive claims, solidify regulatory claims of gender. Butler’s concept of performativity has been useful for thinking about the transgressive potential of disobedience to categories of gender. But, like poststructuralist theory, feminist theories do not adequately account for the ways discourses of race shape what the gendered body means or the levels of violence embedded in processes of its racialization (D. Roberts 1997). It also rarely considers that not all bodies are gendered as women in the same way. As Chandra Mohanty argued in “Under Western Eyes” (1984), the category “woman” is also not a universalist category.</p>
<p>With black people’s bodies shot through with such long histories of knowledge production, black people would seem unable to escape systems of racial terror. Scholars working in black cultural and political contexts wrestle with these concepts of subject formation, sovereignty, and agency, concepts all linked to the body in theories of race. In <em>Scenes of Subjection</em>, Saidiya Hartman asks, “How do the forms, relations, and institutions of power condition the exercise of agency? . . . What exercise of the will, forms of action, or enactment of possibility is available to animate chattel or the socially dead or to the excluded ones?” (1997, 54, 55). In other words, what are the ways black people have been able to set the terms by which they inhabit their bodies under such violent systems of oppression? Scholars continue to explore other ways to understand the body that loosen the hold of racist epistemologies. We can turn to what theorists call “embodied knowledges,” that is, ways of perceiving the self and the world grounded in phenomenological ways of knowing. Embodied knowledge challenges Descartes’s separation of mind and body, which associated the mind with the higher faculties and the body with animal drives. Instead, the body itself is a site of knowledge production. Theories of embodied knowledge also challenge the idea that the body is a passive recipient of meaning. The body is not an empty vessel, or a tabula rasa, defined by discourse. Nor is it just a medium, channeling the demands of discursive regimes. Such theories of embodied knowledge focus on the collective, rejecting individualism embedded in Western epistemologies, and ground their theories in the idea that the body is always in relation to other beings and the world.</p>
<p>Scholars look to black histories of rebellion, escape, maroonage, and daily acts of resistance for the ways black people use their bodies to refuse the terms by which dominant regimes would mark them. They introduce tropes such as “stealing away” and “fugitivity” as ways to recognize these forms of refusal. As Cedric Robinson ([1983] 2000) shows, insurrections and rebellions were constant during slavery. Political protests are also a form of collective enactment dependent on the body. Organized protests include the silent march organized by the NAACP in 1917 to protest the practice of lynching. As thousands marched silently down Fifth Avenue in New York City, the act protested the exclusion of black people from the democratic protections of the nation, which the public spaces of the city were meant to embody. As Robin Kelley (1994) writes, other forms of disrupting public space include the many unofficial instances of daily resistance on public transportation and on the job, as well as demonstrations against segregation, including the bus boycotts and the sit-­in movement begun by students in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1960. More recently, to protest the multiple deaths of black men at the hands of police, actions such as “die ins” were organized in the 2010s to disrupt business as usual.</p>
<p>In the twenty-­first century, scholarly study of the body has given way to a wider examination of the material world. Thinking of all matter as made of the same elements, organized relationally, decenters the human body, as it questions the liberal humanist model of the possessive individual. Humanity is no longer the pinnacle of an evolutionary ladder. Drawing from the philosopher Gilles Deleuze, scholars have begun to think of the body as an “assemblage of forces, or flows, intensities and passions” (Braidotti 2006, 201). In response to climate change, scholarship has taken a turn to the ecological, and studies of the body have emphasized its connection and enmeshment in wider ecologies. The body becomes aggregate, a combination of cohabiting cells and bacteria, and the boundaries between organic and inorganic, animate and inanimate matter, become porous (J. Bennett 2010). Some scholars challenge the recurrence of the universal body in these theories and pay attention to the vastly different relationship of racialized and indigenous bodies within their environments, from indigenous modes of being within planetary ecologies to the effects of environmental racism (Alaimo 2010).</p>
<p>Many scholars explore expressive cultures as forms through which black people inhabit their bodies on alternate terms. Through music and dance, racialized subjects reclaim their bodies from exploitative systems and violent practices (Kelley 1994). As Achille Mbembe writes, “the slave is able to demonstrate the protean capabilities of the human bond through music and the very body that was supposedly possessed by another” (2003, 22). These performance practices operate in a nonlinguistic register, on a frequency tuned into through feeling and sound. Rather than discourse, we can consider the concept of utterance, which includes tone, pitch, timbre, and nonlinguistic vocalisms, improvisation, and blue notes. Grounded in expressive forms of movement, we can incorporate the knowledge of our physical being with porous boundaries between ourselves, others, and the world. In this way, black cultures and philosophies offer us alternative ways to think about, and live within, our black bodies.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The word “cinema” refers to an art and industrial practice; it names a craft, a business, an enactment of cultural production, and an object of disciplinary study. African American studies is an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary field devoted to the study of history, philosophic traditions, gender, sexuality, culture, the arts, social life, and political thought as these issues relate to African Americans. The field’s appreciation of the idea of race and how this idea is manifest in innumerable facets of American life crucially informs the study of the art of blackness. Therefore, to map out “cinema” as a keyword for African American studies requires us to address several interrelated questions. How might the methodologies and critical tendencies of African American studies inform an understanding of cinema, and subsequently, how might cinema inform an understanding of African American studies? Second, what are the terms of engagement that are most generative for considering cinema and African American studies?</p>
<p>One of the important ways that African American studies has impacted the study of American cinema is through its sustained examination of how cinema, as a part of a larger field of American visual culture, has contributed to, perpetuated, and instantiated a dangerously false conception of visuality as truth or innocuous. This point is especially evident by the reception history of D. W. Griffith’s <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> (1916). An adaptation of Thomas Dixon Jr.’s <em>The Clansman</em> (1905), Griffith’s film offered significantly innovative approaches to narrative and editing that became a standard in the development of the language of cinema. Furthermore, the film is a torrid New South text that figures the Confederacy and slavery as noble and heroic gestures. The Civil War is rendered in the rhetoric of Northern aggression, and Reconstruction is pictured as white struggle amid a sea of freed African American savages and duplicitous carpetbaggers. The men of the Ku Klux Klan, in Griffith’s Christian rhetoric of love, family, nationhood, are framed as heroes rather than violent terrorists. Cinema studies work in African American studies scholarship has vitally framed <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> as a white supremacist text. At the same time, scholarship has detailed African American activist protests against the film, the circulation of the idea of black cinema during the early twentieth century, the growth of black film criticism, and the ways in which African American film spectatorship was a negotiation with turn-­of-­the-­century ideals of black modernity (Everett 2001; Stewart 2005; Field 2015). Yet the critical struggle of disputing egregious tendencies of antiblack visual culture cannot be addressed in strictly the terms of false or <em>negative</em> images that must be corrected by authentic or <em>positive</em> ones. Instead, African American studies provides ways of understating cinema’s place in the broader conceptual field of black visual and expressive culture and, moreover, the ways in which the study of race and cinema might open onto related questions of race and art in other fields of study (e.g., cinema, visual culture, literature, art history, cultural studies, women and gender studies, and queer studies). By enlivening the study of this art and grounding it in questions of race, history, aesthetics, and culture, this approach to reframing the study of cinema widens the aesthetic and formal avenues of inquiry (Guerrero 1993; Massood 2003).</p>
<p>If “cinema” in African American studies refers not just to a discrete set of art objects but to the larger racial-­historical context in which the film industry and its products operate, we must consider the structural logic and function of renderings of blackness in film, egregious or otherwise. This kind of interrogation of cinema would follow up on Toni Morrison’s call to consider representational systems in less binaristic and unidirectional ways, to, in her terms, “avert the critical gaze from the racial object to the racial subject; from the described and imagined to the describers and imaginers; from the serving to the served” (1992, 90). For the study of cinema, this ultimately means considering the political and aesthetic consequence of various facets that compose the cinematic arts; and it means understanding that the measure of cinema’s capacity to render blackness must be understood in terms of particularities over essences. Put simply, to study cinema is never just a question of accuracy, authenticity, or truth. In “‘But Compared to What?’: Reading Realism, Representation, and Essentialism in <em>School Daze</em>, <em>Do the Right Thing</em>, and the Spike Lee Discourse,” Wahneema Lubiano argues for a greater rigor when considering the idea of race in cinema to avoid engendering it as a natural phenomenon. As she observes, “What is race in the United States if not an attempt to make ‘real’ a set of social assumptions about biology?” (1996a, 175). Her reading of the reception of Spike Lee’s films and the rhetoric of realism is a vital conception of African American studies with attention to gender and to film and media.</p>
<p>Cinema is as an art and critical practice that must be irreconcilable in the sense that it must not be considered exclusively accountable to social categories of race, gender, sexuality, and class. Instead, cinema’s generative value to African American studies lies in how it challenges, refashions, and engages with the field’s politics and perspectives. This amply provides for a consideration of art as critical and speculative rather than merely a footnote to the lived experience of race. As Stuart Hall notes, “Films are not necessarily good because black people make them. They are not necessarily ‘right-­on’ by virtue of the fact that they deal with the black experience” ([1989] 1996, 445). Hall’s succinct disavowal of elementary readings of the idea of black film, ones driven by content and the racial identity of the producers, insists on understanding black visual and expressive culture as a process rather than as an essential product. Just as he calls for an interrogation of how blackness is constructed with his rhetorical query, “What is this ‘black’ in black popular culture?” scholars must vigilantly consider what is this “black” in black film (1992)?</p>
<p>In the absence of absolute assurances and sanctions in cinema, there is blackness. As Fred Moten writes, blackness “is always a disruptive surprise moving in the rich nonfullness of every term it modifies. Such mediation suspends neither the question of identity nor the question of essence” (2003, 255n1). Moten’s qualification of blackness purposefully thrives on its performative quality. For him, blackness operates as a churning and refining force beyond the bounds of identitarian ontologies. It is the potentiality and irreducibility of blackness, an understanding of it as an act and idea, that importantly informs what I term “film blackness.” Film blackness marks, enlivens, and amends the idea of black film as an <em>always disruptive surprise</em> that might pose new paradigms for genre, narrative, aesthetics, historiography, visuality, and intertextuality. Film blackness entails understanding the ways cinema operates as a visual negotiation, if not tension, between film as art and race as a constitutive, cultural fiction. The conceptual term focuses on the irreducible character of blackness and the radical capacity of black visual and expressive culture, a difference that ceaselessly devises and recasts (M. Gillespie 2016).</p>
<p>As a term that I offer in conversation with “cinema,” <em>film blackness</em> invites a necessary reckoning with how the idea of black film as an enactment of black visual and expressive culture generates acute and imaginative stagings of the art of blackness and the discursivity of race. If blackness is always already an incitement, question, and process, then the methodological goal of film blackness is not to provide an autopsy of an inanimate system. Rather, film blackness recognizes “cinema” as neither immanent category nor genre nor merely the reflection of the black experience. It insists that cinema’s stagings be read for their artistic and epistemological consequence in the sense of understanding how the idea of black film is bound by historiography over history, performativity over essential identity, culture over fantasies of embodied truth. Thus, each film devises something other than an identitarian absolute, and each film tacitly details aesthetic choices that represent <em>speculations</em> and <em>remediations</em> of history and culture.</p>
<p>Black film offers “cinema” up as a question, not as an answer. This is evident in multiple ways as each film poses a distinct demonstration of how the critical mission and strategies of African American studies can provide for richly complicated and textured understandings of the modalities and nuances that constitute the idea of black film. One such example of film blackness and the critical lens of African American studies as offering strategies for reading and understanding film is Wendell Harris’s <em>Chameleon Street</em> (1989). It is an independent film based on the real-­life exploits of criminal impersonation carried out Douglas Street Jr. starting in 1971. His impersonations include passing himself off as a professional athlete, a reporter for <em>Time</em> magazine, a medical student, an exchange student from Martinique, and a lawyer. <em>Chameleon Street</em>’s episodic narrative is propelled by the anxious energy of a black genius sociopath bored and inspired by the innumerable privileges and poses that the world has to offer. With each successful impersonation, Street raises the stakes for how one might consider the renegade ways of racial performance. Indeed, the reception history of the film shows how the film challenged the industrial and critical standard of what constituted a black film. The film does not render the life of Street in the immediate terms of a biopic but instead offers several crucial encounters with many facets of black visual and expressive culture. First, the unmoored quality of Street as film character, his ability to circulate with an ethos of convincibility, simultaneously engages with the literature and scholarship on passing and performativity. His movements and poses mark him as an interlocutor and organizer of space and time to such an extent that he is framed as master of many different forms of social privileges and knowledge. Significantly, his performative tactics occur across multiple channels, which include an antidiagnostic dispute, the menace of mimicry, a black modernist measure of intertextuality, and improvisational chaos. Taking these tendencies together as a whole offers us a way of thinking through the critical strategies that African American studies has developed with regard to the considerations of philosophy, black masculinities, literature, and psychoanalysis in contemporary cinema.</p>
<p>The fundamental importance of <em>Chameleon Street</em> and other films like it—­films that have not been considered in the canon of “black film” or “African American cinema”—­cannot be overstated. <em>Chameleon Street</em> extensively challenges the conventional (and limited) perceptions of the very idea of black film that circulated at the time of its release and persist today. What followed the film was a critical refusal to understand <em>Chameleon Street</em> in the terms of black film, independent film, or art film or to understand it as multivalent and thus engaging all these registers. This critical refusal reveals the deeply antiblack and exclusionary tendencies of categories of knowledge within cinematic practice and knowledge.</p>
<p>Another film to consider as a challenge to and within African American studies is Arthur Jafa’s <em>Dreams Are Colder than Death</em> (2013). An experimental documentary, <em>Dreams</em> focuses on the meaning of Dr. King’s “I Have a Dream” speech fifty years later and asks whether the goals and ambitions of the civil rights movement have been achieved: “Does the dream live on? And if so, what has changed?” The query centers on a sustained and prescient consideration of what blackness is, what the history of blackness is, and what the concept means to black people today. During the film’s opening sequence, there is a reverse-­motion shot of young black men appearing to fly backward from a public swimming pool. Is this a sign of desegregation rolling back? Amid the gymnastics of black bodies cast from the water, the literary critic Hortense Spillers’s voice comes on the soundtrack: “I know we are going to lose this gift of black culture unless we are careful, this gift that is given to people who didn’t have a prayer.” Spillers’s “I know” is answered by Dr. King’s “I have a dream” on the soundtrack; her comments are ghosted by his famous speech. In this prelude to the title sequence and the introduction of the film’s premise, there is the distance between a gift in peril and a prophecy. <em>Dreams</em> is an essay film, a nonfiction form of intellectual and artistic innovation whose black stream of consciousness is prefaced by Spillers’s concern for the state of black culture.</p>
<p>A visual historiography of black thought on and off campus, <em>Dreams Are Colder than Death</em> seethes with a productively agnostic impression of the idea of African American history that is offered in exquisitely visual and mosaic terms. It brings together a group of visual artists, revolutionaries, musicians, academics, filmmakers, activists, and everyday citizens to offer a history of critical resistance, philosophic practice, and expressivity. I would like to briefly focus on Moten’s appearance. In the final section of the film, his voice is paired with footage of him walking, and that is coupled with footage from a Trayvon Martin protest rally in Los Angeles. The slow-­motion movement of a mass protest devoted to a black boy coded by a hoodie, murdered, and left to die in the rain with no shelter from the storm becomes punctuated by Moten’s commentary: “When you say that black people are just an effect of slavery, you raise the question: Can black people be loved? . . . Not desired, not wanted, not acquired, not lusted after. Can black people be loved? Can blackness be loved?”</p>
<p>The question that Moten raises in <em>Dreams Are Colder than Death</em> appears in the context of a consideration of blackness and the object of African American studies, a commentary that is interspersed throughout the film. This love signifies a critical devotion to recognize blackness in terms other than horror. Moten suggests that blackness is always already an act of faith within African American studies. This faith speaks to the potentialities of futurity: the immateriality of faith shadows and moderates the affective force of blackness and how blackness as cultural, aesthetic, historiographic, and political praxis is engendered. <em>Dreams</em> demonstrates the rigor of black visual and expressive culture as a study of thought, language, and performativity. The film pivots away from the narrative of Dr. King’s dream to a dynamic envisioning of black praxis and freedom dreams. <em>Can blackness be loved?</em> Moten’s question, an exquisite explanation for <em>Dreams Are Colder than Death</em>, resounds as a rhetorical call, a devotional affirmation, an act of revolutionary hope. In its devotion to a practice of black intellectual montage, it is a multidimensional and rhythmic configuration of blackness that is significantly informed by ideas that have developed in African American studies.</p>
<p>Rather than an unmediated window on the world, “cinema,” in the context of African American studies, signifies this very reconfiguration of blackness. Cinema’s relationship to African American studies is fundamentally situated on the premise of art as discursive craft and production rather than as mimetic reflection. As most evident with the idea of black film and the enactments of film blackness, African American studies as a field of critically collaborative plentitude offers vital opportunities for the study of cinema in ways of great benefit to the understanding of art, culture, and history.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A city is a geographic region that consists of large numbers of people. Most dictionaries refer to it as a “large town,” but cities are more than that. Cities are living organisms. They are not stable; they change over time. The urban planner Lewis Mumford called the city a “theater of social action” ([1937] 2011, 93). And as theaters of social action, cities bring different kinds of bodies into close contact. The feminist geographer Elizabeth Grosz argues that the city is a kind of network that “links otherwise unrelated bodies” (1998, 32). The city is not simply an external thing outside of us; cities “seep into and effect all other elements that go into the constitution of” bodies (Grosz 1998, 35). The French social theorist and spatial thinker Henri Lefebvre described the city as a place where there are “relations of immediacy . . . between people and groups that make up society” (2006, 101). In other words, cities are an “interface” where social groups, institutions, families, and bodies interact and mutually inform one another.</p>
<p>These musings on the city illustrate that cities are not passive landscapes; they are active organisms that produce social life as it produces itself. So what does this mean for Black people? This question is important given the history of redlining, segregation, plantation slavery, forced migration, and mass incarceration. For Black people, the city has been a place where hope, possibility, and virulent racism are linked. If the city is a kind of stage, what dramas have been played out on it vis-­à-­vis Black people? And how have Black people been informed by the city, and how have they informed it?</p>
<p>For the past century, the city has been the place where Black politics, art, culture, identity, and resistance were played out. The drama has been intense. Riots, anti-­Black violence, housing and economic segregation, the birth of new cultural and artistic movements, and identity formations have all happened on the landscape of the city. North American cities, for example, were the places Black southerners fled to in order to escape the terrorism of southern white supremacy and to improve their economic standing. Like Blacks in North America, Blacks in the other European colonies were also pushed and pulled to the European metropolis, escaping colonial racism and poverty. Others made their way to colonies through military and/or university. These push and pull factors radially transformed Black life and the city. The city has been the spatial backdrop that produced a wellspring of Black cultural, artistic, and political movements. It also became the place where the racialization of space and the fight against it were most intense.</p>
<p>For most of the discipline’s existence, geography and geographers were not concerned with Black people. The discipline did not find Black people suitable subjects of study until the 1960s, which has made Black geographic knowledge marginal in the discipline. Black sociologists and artists were the first to examine Black people in the city. W. E. B. Du Bois’s <em>The Philadelphia Negro</em> (1899) was the first study of Black life in a major city, and it set the stage for future studies. James Weldon Johnson’s <em>Black Manhattan</em> (1930) charted Black migration from the U.S. South and the Caribbean to New York from the early twentieth century until the 1930s. St. Clair Drake and Horace Cayton’s pathbreaking book <em>Black Metropolis</em> (1945) examined Black life in Chicago (which was the site of the largest section of migrants in the nation) from the first leg of the Great Black Migration (1917) until the early 1940s. All three of these texts are sociological. Nevertheless, each engaged the question of how the geography of the city transformed Black life and how in turn Black people transformed the city. All three studies demonstrated that economic, political, family, and cultural life of Black people were drastically altered by cities. For them, the city was not simply a different place were Black peopled lived but a new arena for the evolution of Black life that presented new opportunities and new challenges.</p>
<p>Black artistic expression and Black life flourished in cities. Twentieth-­ and early-­twenty-­first-­century Black arts have essentially been urban arts movements. The Harlem Renaissance, jazz, and hip-­hop are artistic movements that are rooted in city space. The same goes for fashion, dance, filmmaking, and painting. Again, this is not a North American phenomenon. Diasporic forms of dance, music, and performance have also emerged from Black city life.</p>
<p>Many Black writers have made the city their canvas. Richard Wright used the city to craft his most well-­known character—­Bigger Thomas in his novel <em>Native Son</em> (1940). James Baldwin saw the city as a complex space of gender, racial, and sexual fluidity in works such as <em>Go Tell It on the Mountain</em> (1953), <em>Giovanni’s Room</em> (1956), and <em>Another Country</em> (1962), while for Anne Petry’s novel <em>The Street</em> (1946), the city was the space of patriarchy and racism. Frank London Brown’s novel <em>Trumbull Park</em> (1959) and Lorainne Hansberry’s play <em>A Raisin in the Sun</em> (1958) both show the intensity of Chicago’s racial segregation and Black people’s steadfast opposition to it.</p>
<p>No Black art form has acknowledged the centrality of the city more than music. The city has been ever present in the lyrics, tempo, harmonies, and syncopation of Black music. We see this in jazz, rhythm and blues, blues, hip-­hop, reggae, and house. It can be heard in the frenetic pace of Dizzy Gillespie’s “Groovin’ High” (1947) or Charlie Parker’s “Thriving on a Riff” (1957). Stevie Wonder’s “Living for the City” (1973) charts the Black migration narrative, Marvin Gaye’s “Inner City Blues” (1973) captures the despair of poverty and political violence, and Prince’s “Uptown” (1980) sees the city as a space of racial and sexual fluidity and cultural freedom. Rap music has made the city the cornerstone of its lyrical and musical expression, as well. Rappers are never decoupled from the cities that influence their idiosyncratic style. And they use their music to pay homage to the places that birthed their style. Boogie Down Production’s “South Bronx” (1987), N.W.A.’s “Straight Outta Compton” (1988), Tupac Shakur and Dr. Dre’s “California Love” (1996), Jay-­Z’s “Empire State of Mind” (2009), Common’s “Southside” (2007), Jermaine Dupri’s “Welcome to Atlanta” (2002), and E-­40’s “Tell Me When to Go” (2006) are just a few of the songs that acknowledge the city in the creation of rap music’s sonic force.</p>
<p>While art and culture have been profoundly shaped by urban landscapes, forms of constraint, immobilization, and containment have also been a hallmark of Black life in the city. As I have written elsewhere (Shabazz 2015), Black people in cities have faced and continue to face the legacy of carceral containment that is built into the landscape and architecture of their communities. Be it policing, housing, urban planning, or security practices, Black people in cities such as Chicago have faced punitive geographies that made some parts of the city prison-­like. The impact of these practices has created implications that go beyond high incarceration rates and immobility. These practices have affected performances of Black masculinity, mobility, and the general health of the community.</p>
<p>But containment has only been one facet of the urban racial struggle. Segregation, economic underdevelopment, environmental racism, and police violence are the social forces that have given rise to many modern antiracist movements. Black nationalism was an urban movement. Started in the early twentieth century, Black nationalism grew in Black cities such as New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago, and Los Angeles. The concentration of Black people in those cities and the philosophy that championed economic and political control, as well as cultural renewal, influenced many Black city dwellers and their communities. Harlem and the South Side of Chicago, for example, were the centers of Black nationalism, and Black nationalism had significant impact on the politics expressed in these cites.</p>
<p>Black political organizing was also rooted in the racial geography of the city. The Black Panther Party for Self-­Defense was started in Oakland, California, in 1968. Focused on defending Black communities from police violence, the Black Panthers were influenced by Black nationalism, but they were also informed by the politics of class struggle and anticolonialism. More than simply self-­defense, the Panthers provided a number of programs for the urban poor. Free breakfast, shoes, medical care, and trips to visit incarcerated loved ones were essential programs for Oakland’s Black community.</p>
<p>These political movements were not limited to North America. The antiapartheid movement was centered in Johannesburg, as was the Black Power movement in London. As in the U.S., the intensity of racism in these cities and the large numbers of Black people who were being subject to it gave rise to challenges.</p>
<p>Why does the space in which Black life is performed and constituted matter? It matters because Black matters are spatial matters. And the places where Black people express their identities and struggle for recognition influence the tone and terror of their lives. Space and where we are in it determine in large part our identity and future mobility in the world. Space is not just an empty container; it is a dynamic social and geographic sphere where the spatial makeup of place influences and is influenced by the people who inhabit it.</p>
<p>Another reason the city is so important is because space is central to subject formation. Space influences how subjects are formed. More than an empty signifier, space helps to inform the forms of mobility and immobility, access and denial; it produces the “instrumentalities through which individuals express themselves” (Wright 1940, xxvi). In other words, space creates the context for the production of subjects. Moreover, if the environment is “warped or tranquil the mode and manner of behavior will be affected” (Wright 1940, xxvi). Before human geographers explored the relationship between people and place, Richard Wright was examining how the small, cramped and confining domiciles on Chicago’s South Side were impacting identify formation of Black migrants from the South. What he discovered is that while geography is not destiny, it does inform the production of subjects.</p>
<p>The city also changed Black life because of the nature of the environment. Despite being places that bring different people together, cities have been where racial segregation was most intense. Through laws, urban planning, architecture, and violence, Black people were <em>spatialized</em> in cities. It was the possibility of differently racialized people coming into contact, particularly Blacks with whites, that produced the architecture of confinement that created Black geographies. This is why segregation efforts have been so intense in cities. The threat of Blacks and whites in close proximity, for example, spurred efforts to intensify racial segregation. In this meshing but yet deeply divided geography, Black people lived with what Richard Wright called a “taunting sense of possible achievement” (1940, xxvi). They were spatially close to whites and the economic structures they controlled, while being segregated from them and cut off from their economic benefits. This has been the dominant pattern of racial organization in the city for the past century.</p>
<p>Black people have not only shaped the city but also been shaped by it. The intense racial segregation of the city informs Black people’s mobility within in it. The city informs performances of gender and the health of the community. It shaped the kinds of foods Black people eat, the sports they play, the clothes they where. The city informs whom they develop relationships with, their sexual options, and their political persuasions.</p>
<p>As cities around the world become the places that capital flies to and where the poor and working class are pushed out, Black people’s relationship to them is sure to change. The rising cost of housing in North American and most western European cities will force Blacks throughout the diaspora to move to new places. Whether these new places will be cities remains to be seen. But what is for certain is that once again the geographies on which Black life is constituted will be struggled over.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The civil rights movement looms large in twentieth-­century African American studies. Regardless of one’s politics or the dearth of course material on race in American primary schools, the struggle for integration, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., and the March on Washington (sans the “for Jobs and Freedom” part of the march’s title) have come to stand in for civil rights. The heroic icons and damning imagery naturalizes civil rights as a corrective to American democracy. Yet “civil rights” is a rather vague term. Do noncitizens have civil rights? If not, where can they turn for protection? Do political actors decide the boundaries of civil rights? And does the “civil” in “civil rights” account for the exigencies of humanity or the demands of everyday human existence?</p>
<p>“Civil rights” defines the protected rights and privileges of citizens. As a keyword used to articulate the quest for equality, it tends to rest on two major strivings: inclusion and protection. The numerous civil rights acts since the end of the Civil War and congressional amendments marked the legislative struggles to codify citizenship for Black people and hold the federal government accountable for protecting those rights and privileges. As such, the field of civil rights has historically fallen into the realm of enumeration—­a listing of positive and, later, negative rights endowed to citizens, also called birthright citizenship. The act of enumeration can obscure the essence of being. Where does the right to live fit into the enumerated list of protected rights, which would be assumed under Thomas Jefferson’s poetic rendition of protest ensconced in the beginning of the Declaration of Independence—­“life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness”? “Civil rights” is a malleable term that intersects with equal rights and, most radically, with human rights. In fact, Black people who fought for civil rights and scholars of African American studies use this keyword interchangeably with “freedom struggle” or “struggle for racial equality” (Sugrue 2008). This keyword is as essential to the foundations of the United States as freedom, democracy, and equality, and it is contested through keywords such as “equity” and “humanity.”</p>
<p>Civil rights come with the expectations of freedom. In the eighteenth century, at the time of the American Revolutionary War, free Black citizens articulated claims on citizenship. While they did not use the term “civil rights,” they based their demands on the rights accorded free men. In 1787, Rev. Prince Hall, born in Barbados, a Revolutionary War veteran, and the founder of Black freemasonry in colonial America, was among the petitioners to urge the Massachusetts State Legislature to grant Black citizens access to common education because they had “the right to enjoy the privileges of free men.” The petitioners based their claim on having “never been backward in paying [their] proportionate part of the burdens under which [other free men] have, or may labor under” (H. Aptheker 1951, 19–­20). Hall and the other petitioners emphasized that they deserved access to education because they paid taxes as free men. This petition said nothing of their enslaved counterparts. In the nineteenth century, Alexis de Tocqueville made similar observations about the fruits of a tax-­paying Black citizenry. He noted in his travels through Pennsylvania that even among the Quakers, “freed Blacks are not allowed to exercise civil rights. They pay the taxes; is it not fair that they should have a vote?” (1841, 282). These free Black citizens and Tocqueville pointed to specific expectations of freedom and citizenship: education and the franchise. These observations prefigure the battles over civil rights in the antebellum North, similar battles that hinged on access to education and suffrage.</p>
<p>Until the end of the Civil War, civil rights as a keyword bounced around northern states, where Black citizens struggled to define their freedom and citizenship in the national shadows of slavery. The end of the Civil War might have settled the physical conflict between the North and South, but freedom remained contested terrain, which means “civil rights” emerged as a keyword in the reconstruction of the union. From 1865 to 1896, states defined and redefined Black citizenship but also what rights and privileges they should enjoy. To be sure, states responded to the push and pull of Black assertiveness and white resistance. African Americans did not need the state to define civil rights for them, as enslaved or freed people. No longer bound to a master, they decided when they would work despite being bound to an employer. African Americans of Edisto Island, South Carolina, petitioned President Andrew Johnson that they had a right to keep and purchase land they had worked, land that had been ceded to them through Field Order Number 15 and then stripped from them and returned to former Confederates at Johnson’s order. African Americans set up small schools. They reconstituted families that had been torn asunder during slavery. They organized political conventions as a collective forum to discuss the direction of Black men’s votes. They did not articulate the reconstitution of their lives as a quest toward civil rights but rather as an exercise of freedom. When African Americans were denied those freedoms, such as when the Black Codes emerged in what seemed like mere moments after the fall of Appomattox, they entered “rights” talk: the expectations and entitlements of citizenship.</p>
<p>Facing these kinds of restrictions on public life, African Americans were undaunted, forcing the federal government to legally define civil rights through legislative acts, most notably the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1875, the latter of which the Supreme Court rendered unconstitutional in the Civil Rights Cases of 1883. The 1866 act—­“An Act to Protect All Persons in the United States in Their Civil Rights, and Furnish the Means of Their Vindication”—­defined national citizens as all persons born in the United States (except Indians). The 1866 act served as an act of inclusion, which held white citizenship as the standard that Blacks should be brought up to. It outlined the rights that citizens, regardless of race, would enjoy, including “to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, and give evidence, to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property, and to full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens” (Civil Rights Act 1866). Considering the devastating decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), Radical Republicans helped to pass the Fourteenth Amendment to overturn Dred Scott and solidify Black citizenship. Yet citizenship did not necessarily open the doors to civil rights.</p>
<p>The Civil Rights Act of 1875 expanded the definition of civil rights beyond individual market transactions and juridical access, to include equal enjoyment of the public sphere, or an unfettered mobility to live freely. African Americans wasted no time testing the new act. Within days of its passage, they sought admission in theaters, hotels, and restaurants. In an uncanny twist of fate, they even tested the act against their own brethren. Black barbers operated their commercial barbershops exclusively for white patrons. Black activists ironically drew on the Civil Rights Act in their protests to suggest that open access should not be contingent on the race of the proprietor. Private property and whiteness, or the will of white patrons, curtailed Black men’s mobility in the public sphere (Q. Mills 2013). These acts, and questions of their constitutionality, emerged because Black citizens sought to live their lives freely and to make choices. Because they were denied access to these rights, the state provided legal definitions that would serve as recourse in the courts if those rights were denied. But Blacks had to file suit to be heard; however, courts seldom lent a listening ear.</p>
<p>In the immediate years after the end of Reconstruction, the Supreme Court gave southern states a sign that the federal government would allow the states to define civil rights. Whiteness equaled property, and if its public face were challenged, the state would protect it by deeming it private and outside the list of “protected rights.” In the Civil Rights Cases of 1883, the Court held that Congress, in the Civil Rights Act of 1875, had overstepped its powers under the Fourteenth Amendment in trying to regulate private discrimination. The Court interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment to prohibit discriminatory state action “such as the enactment of laws that denied equal protection,” as opposed to the acts of private property owners exercising their property rights (Tushnet 1996, 75). So, as long as the state did not require discriminatory action, private parties could exclude anyone.</p>
<p>At the turn of the twentieth century, race-­based and colorblind policies emerged in tandem and shaped the contours of civil rights as a keyword. The Civil Rights Cases proved to be the pallet that Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) rested on. When the Supreme Court upheld Louisiana’s separate-­but-­equal train-­car policy, it paved the way for segregation laws in other areas of society. In turn, Black activists mounted their civil rights struggles against this behemoth of de jure racial ordering. Yet alongside these explicitly race-­based policies were state-­enacted colorblind policies that said nothing of race but targeted African Americans. At the turn of the twentieth century, southern states rewrote their state constitutions and effectively disenfranchised their Black citizens. Among the criteria for voting, states required a poll tax and literacy tests. While these requirements applied to all potential voters, Black citizens were denied access in nefarious ways.</p>
<p>The claims of private property and states’ rights won out in the wrangling over the civil rights debates in the late nineteenth century. Yet the struggles for freedom extended far beyond hotel rooms, theater seats, barbershop chairs, classroom seats, and the ballot box. Was it a civil right to be protected from lynching? These were private acts, though sanctioned by state actors (police, jail clerks). The Enforcement (“Ku Klux Klan”) Act of 1871 came close to providing such protections by prohibiting terrorist organizations, such as the Klan, from violently or otherwise preventing Black voting, jury service, or office-­holding (Bardolph 1970, 52–­54).</p>
<p>Black activists refused to stand by while Black men and women were lynched for suspicion, for false allegation, or simply for being. For example, Ida B. Wells was a pioneer in investigative journalism. Wells declared lynching an act of terror. “Thomas Moss, Calvin McDowell, and Lee Stewart had been lynched in Memphis,” she noted in her autobiography, “one of the leading cities of the South, in which no lynching had taken place before, with just as much brutality as other victims of the mob; and they had committed no crime against white women. This is what opened my eyes to what lynching really was. An excuse to get rid of Negroes who were acquiring wealth and property and thus keep the race terrorized” (Wells-­Barnett 1970, 64). With a keen methodological approach, she produced three pamphlets—­Lynch Law in All Its Phases, A Red Record, and Mob Rule in New Orleans—­debunking the myth of black hypersexuality as a factor in lynching cases. She embarked on a national and international campaign not simply to “change the law” but to “tell the truth freely” to alter the public discourse (J. Royster 1996, 40; Bay 2009). While Wells did not frame her antilynching crusade as a call for civil rights, lynching and extralegal racial violence largely proved such an overwhelming stain on American democracy and the contours of citizenship that, thanks to Wells, Black activists increasingly looked to the federal government for protection.</p>
<p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) carried on Wells’s antilynching crusade. While the civil rights organization is most known for dismantling de jure segregation in public education, particularly through Brown v. Board of Education (1954), its initial campaigns included increasing public awareness of racial violence and lobbying for an antilynching bill. The organization’s turn toward litigation and desegregating education stemmed from its successful mob-­rule case, Moore v. Dempsey (1923), which ruled the defendants were denied due process when white mobs loomed in the shadows of their trials, thus intimidating them and the jurors. Megan Francis notes that two decades of antilynching activism put the NAACP on the radar of the Garland Fund, which eventually provided funding to focus on desegregating public schools (M. Francis 2014; Tushnet 1987).</p>
<p>In the post–­World War II period, racial violence continued to inform understandings of civil rights. Black activists found a listening ear from President Harry Truman’s administration in the immediate aftermath of the war and an emerging Cold War political moment. In the wake of postwar racial violence in Columbia, Tennessee, Georgia, and Louisiana, a coalition of organizations such as the NAACP, Urban League, and the new National Emergency Committee Against Mob Violence pressured Truman’s administration to act. Truman, urged by an aide and the attorney general, favored a national civil rights committee to address racial violence; and with an executive order, he established the President’s Committee on Civil Rights. Truman charged the committee to “make recommendations with respect to adoption or establishment by legislation or otherwise of more adequate means and procedures for protection of civil rights of the people of the United States” (Lawson 2004, 14). Racial violence was considered under the umbrella of civil rights atrocities. The historian Steven Lawson notes, “Truman used the terms civil rights and civil liberties interchangeably with racial discrimination and religious bigotry” (2004, 21). Strikingly, the Committee on Civil Rights did not centralize the keyword “civil rights.” Phileo Nash, an aide to Truman, noted, “The use of the word ‘civil rights’ . . . came about in the course of our staff studies. We thought it advisable to find a term that was slightly fresh, and the word civil rights was not used for this function at that time” (Lawson 2004, 21). The committee brought together the “rights essential to the citizen in a free society” mentioned in the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and Franklin Roosevelt’s Four Freedoms to highlight the “four basic rights . . . essential to the well-­being of the individual and to the progress of society”: the right to safety and security of the person; the right to citizenship and its privileges; the right to freedom of conscience and expression; and the right to equality of opportunity (Lawson 2004, 51). In fact, the title of the final report, To Secure These Rights, was pulled directly from the Declaration of Independence (C. Wilson 1947). They were not the only ones questioning the keyword “civil rights.”</p>
<p>Historically, this framework of civil rights (inclusion and protection) has been insufficient to realize Black freedom; however, in the 1960s, many activists outside of radical leftist circles began to voice this concern. Just four days after Senate Democrats launched a filibuster of the civil rights bill on March 30, 1964, Malcolm X delivered a speech, titled “The Ballot or the Bullet,” to a mostly Black audience in Cleveland, Ohio. In part, he urged African Americans to “expand the civil-­rights struggle to the level of human rights” in order to “take the case of the black man in this country before the nations in the UN” (Malcolm X [1964] 1994, 34). He reasoned that anyone who deprived African Americans of something, such as rights, that belong to them were criminals. For Malcolm, it seemed futile to appeal to the very criminals who were responsible for denying basic rights and protections. “Civil rights keeps you under his restrictions, under his jurisdiction,” he argued. “Civil rights keeps you in his pocket. Civil rights means you’re asking Uncle Sam to treat you right. Human rights are your God-­given rights. Human rights are the rights that are recognized by all nations of this earth. And any time any one violates your human rights, you can take them to the world court” (Malcolm X [1964] 1994, 35). In July, Malcolm presented a petition to independent African heads of state at the Organization of African Unity (OAU) meeting to urge them to initiate an investigation through the UN Commission on Human Rights, an act he could not initiate as an individual. He was unable to sway his African colleagues.</p>
<p>Martin Luther King also came to realize that “civil rights” as a keyword was limited, but it took the fire of a rebellion for him to see it. African Americans in Los Angeles and other major cities across the country grew increasingly frustrated with a lack of decent and affordable housing, limited access to jobs that paid a living wage, and the constant violence from police brutality. The Los Angeles uprisings in August 1965, just a year after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had passed and five days after the Voting Rights Act had been signed, jolted King and other southern activists fighting for civil rights to rethink this keyword. “The flames of Watts illuminated more than the western sky,” he argued; “they cast light on the imperfections in the civil rights movement and the tragic shallowness of white racial policy in the explosive ghettos” (King [1965] 1991, 189). He came to realize that a restructuring of American democracy, not legislative reform, could repair economic dislocation and restore human dignity. Bayard Rustin also recognized that economic dislocation demonstrated that “at issue, after all, is not civil rights, strictly speaking, but social and economic conditions” (1965, 26).</p>
<p>These men said what women had articulated already. When the student sit-­in movement swept the South, Ella Baker urged critics and supporters not to be fooled into thinking those young people were fighting for the right to purchase a hamburger or the right to sit next to white consumers in a diner. She argued that students were “seeking to rid America of the scourge of racial segregation and discrimination—­not only at lunch counters, but in every aspect of life” (E. Baker 1960, 4). Like Baker, Fannie Lou Hamer understood and projected the ways traditional civil rights discussions needed to touch every aspect of life. Hamer, from Ruleville, Mississippi, was fired from her job as a sharecropper and kicked off the land for attempting to register to vote. Hamer connected disenfranchisement, a privilege of citizenship, and economic reprisals and dislocation in her fight for civil rights. In 1964, she helped organize the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and ran for a Mississippi seat in the U.S. Congress. The “poverty of segregation” was inextricably bound with access to the ballot. Black patients received substandard health care compared to white patients. “Poverty and poor health,” she ascertained in a Memphis World article, “form an unbreakable circle, one which need attention from the people who are suppose to represent us” (Hamer 1964, 8).</p>
<p>There was nothing exceptionally masculine about “civil rights” as a keyword; however, men often assumed it was their role to lead the pubic charge in fighting for it, which often resulted in its heterosexual and masculine framing. As a member of President John Kennedy’s Commission on the Status of Women Committee on Civil and Political Rights, the activist Pauli Murray fought to include protections against sex-­based discrimination as a civil right. She took the “Big Six” male civil rights leaders to task for not including women in the meeting with President Kennedy after the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in August 1963. The men hoped to convince Kennedy to help get the Civil Rights Bill passed, which President Lyndon Johnson ushered through Congress after Kennedy’s assassination. The act was meant to replace the 1875 Civil Rights Act, which had been struck down in 1883. When Senator Everett Dirksen announced in April 1964 that he would consider removing the word “sex” from Title VII of the Civil Rights Bill, Murray was asked to prepare a memo to Congress, since, she recalled, she could “act freely” and was a “victim of both race and sex discrimination” (1987, 356). Murray described her memo as a “strongly worded document, pointing to the historical interrelatedness of the movements for civil rights and women’s rights and the tragic consequences in United States history of ignoring the interrelatedness of human rights.” She pointed out, “A strong argument can be made for the proposition that Title VII without the ‘sex’ amendment would benefit Negro males primarily and thus offer genuine equality of opportunity to only half of the potential Negro work force” (1987, 356–­57). The “sex” amendment remained. Murray believed that Black women had to be in the room to ensure a more universal framing of civil rights. With Murray’s work, sex was included in Title VII of the 1964 act.</p>
<p>If historical subjects have contested the boundaries of civil rights, scholars of African American studies have also questioned this keyword. Few scholars define the meanings of civil rights; however, many debate its conceptual, temporal, and geographical boundaries. The scholarly framing of the keyword “civil rights” centers on its connection to the Black Power movement. The temporal markers of the civil rights movement traditionally move from the Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955–­56) to either the Voting Rights Act of 1965 or Martin Luther King’s assassination in 1968. Jeanne Theoharis, Komozi Woodard, and Jacqueline Dowd Hall suggest that the modern civil rights movement began in the 1930s and extended beyond 1968. This reperiodization is tied to a reframing of civil rights to account for economic issues (workers rights, welfare rights), southern exceptionalism, and the continuities with the Black Power movement (Theoharis and Woodard 2003; J. Hall 2005). In arguing the limits of the traditional civil rights narrative, scholars have increasingly used the term “Black Freedom Movement.” Sundiata Cha-­Jua and Clarence Lang (2007) argue that the “Long Movement Thesis” flattens the distinctions between civil rights and Black Power as distinct waves of black activism and political worldviews.</p>
<p>The line between the temporal and conceptual uses of civil rights are still at play in the usage of “post–­civil rights.” Some Black activists celebrated the legislative gains and marked a new phase of struggle, while others were disillusioned that civil rights gains were limited in scope and marked the inadequacies of a civil rights framework to address the structural challenges to Black freedom. Yet when scholars reference the post–­civil rights era, it is more for the temporal marker than the contestations of the keyword “civil rights.” The very term “post–­civil rights” suggests civil rights have been obtained; however, colorblind politics and the ambiguities of the keyword “civil rights” dangerously suggests freedom and equal opportunity has been obtained. For example, with the proliferation of mass incarceration and the prison industrial complex, Black activists and African American studies scholars have turned their attention to the infrastructures of justice and denial of humanity to Black people. The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement emerged in 2013 when George Zimmerman was acquitted in the killing of the Black youth Trayvon Martin. Frustrated that justice had not been served, Black queer activists Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi started a Twitter hashtag that grew into a larger movement against state violence toward Black people. While some people have referred to this moment as a resurgence of civil rights, is Black Lives Matter a manifestation of civil rights or human rights? At the core of BLM protests are the shootings of unarmed Black people. Only the lack of scale keeps police shootings far from the line of genocide. The right to live reminds all that civil and human rights are not mutually exclusive.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Coalition” is a critical keyword in modern political organizing, denoting the practice of connecting various political groups of differing cultural, social, and/or ideological identities through a common goal or struggle. In the U.S. and internationally, coalition work is now a staple tactic for rallying institutions—­and sometimes electorates—­for specific policy changes whose interests cut across various economic, cultural, and political lines. In the academy, organization theory, or social organization theory—­a branch of sociology and sometimes psychology—­became increasingly interested in coalition organizing as a dominant mode of politics in the wake of civil rights and feminist organizing in the 1960s and ’70s U.S., as well as global student, anticolonial / Third Worldist, and antiwar movements in the same time period. Coalition’s key historical emergence as what we might think of as a social justice practice was then born of and around the time that African American studies—­as well as Chicano/a studies and the formation known as ethnic studies in the academy by the 1980s—­emerged as an institutional critique of higher education’s politics around race and ethnicity.</p>
<p>Coalition as a political strategy in African American politics, of course, dates further back: from antislavery and women’s rights collaborations in the nineteenth century—­from Ida B. Wells and Anna Julia Cooper and other black feminist activists calling for political affiliations between what we might term early or first-­wave civil rights movements (postabolition in the Reconstruction era) and the suffrage movement that was assumed to largely involve white women—­to work between the SCLC and SNCC and any number of organized efforts in the second wave of civil rights in the 1960s, spreading into the 1970s Black Power movement. All of these coalitions sought some strategic solidarity with intersecting marginalized groups for certain events and issues. But it is on the heels of the masculinizing narrative of Black Power and Black nationalism and the whitewashing of the feminist revolution of the 1960s and 1970s in the U.S. that black feminist thought emerged to theorize both itself and coalition as central to African American studies and politics. “Coalition” is then a word and a concept in African American studies that issued in no small part from the active erasure of black women as subjects of and actors in dominant feminist and African American political discourse in the United States.</p>
<p>Coalition stands somewhere in the middle of “solidarity” and “intersectionality” as an activist practice and a theoretical tool of working across certain identitarian boundaries. Black feminist theorists defined and refined the word in the key texts of their fields, most notably as collected in the revolutionary 1983 edited volume <em>Home Girls: A Black Feminist Anthology</em> (B. Smith). There one can find both the Combahee River Collective’s 1977 foundational statement of black feminism and the necessity of coalition and Bernice Johnson Reagon’s transcribed 1981 speech on coalition from the West Coast Women’s Music Festival. Contemporary scholarship in the field seeks to place this work alongside that of Audre Lorde (another contributor to <em>Home Girls</em>), Patricia Hill Collins, and other black feminist intellectuals of that and the following generation as the historical authors of coalition politics, as African American studies has come to know them. This brief essay traces those lines and situates “coalition” as a keyword that has come to redefine feminist and antiracist thought today, as well as the political movements in African America that follow this moment in black feminism.</p>
<p>In Reagon’s manifesto on coalition as both necessary and risky political practice, the black feminist theorist and musicologist uses this scene as a way to imagine coalitional work through the metaphor of everyday life—­that, literally, one can live in a house or “a little barred room,” as she calls it, for only so long, as “there is no hiding place” from difference (2000, 356). She also tells us up front in her essay that coalition work is “the most dangerous work you can do” (356). This is the starting point for understanding the significance of theories and practices of coalition to African American studies, as coalition primarily emerges as a complex methodology—­and political goal—­of black feminist thought. Coalition work is a paradox for Reagon—­that which threatens one’s existence but is also the only way one can “figure out” how to keep existing. I emphasize Reagon’s reasoning at length to ground coalition in a history of black feminist thought that is deeply reflective and pragmatic about both the need for organizing around particular intersectional identities and also the crucial need for issue-­based coalition work. Both are “dangerous,” both are inescapable, both are articulated here in Reagon’s 1981 work. Coalition, then, is not a word that negates what, in shorthand, has become the term “identity” (organizing around a set of social and cultural markers) but one that exists, necessarily, in simultaneity with those strategic designations.</p>
<p>Reagon’s words on the danger but also the call to survival that coalition work entails follow on the heels of the Combahee River Collective’s powerful 1977 stance (also included in both <em>Home Girls</em> and <em>This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color</em>, edited by Cherríe Moraga and Gloria Anzaldúa and first published in 1981). The collective articulates the foundational presence of black feminist thought in social movements even as it calls out disillusionment with those politics, foregrounding the need for coalitional politics built on both antiracism and antisexism. If the Combahee River Collective lays out the historical conditions that undergird the need for coalitional politics, Barbara Smith lays out the ways that creating black feminist theory around multiple sites of oppression has led, in fact, to more and not less of a desire for coalitional work: “Approaching politics with a comprehension of the simultaneity of oppressions has helped to create a political atmosphere particularly conducive to coalition building. . . . A commitment to principled coalitions, based not upon expediency, but upon our actual need for each other is a second major contribution of black feminist struggle” (2000, xxxiv–­xxxv). Here, Smith echoes the sentiments of the frequently cited Audre Lorde on the significance of organizing around difference when she explains that this model of coalitions is particularly suited toward the political positions of Third World women.</p>
<p>Historians, philosophers, and sociologists have also turned to the history of black feminist organizations as a way not just to uncover the work that black women did in and under the umbrella of feminism but to recast contemporary feminist history itself as a narrative of coalition—­some obvious successes, some “failures” in the way we traditionally conceive of politics (found in the work of Stephanie Gilmore [2008], Sandra Harding [2009], Kimberly Springer [2005], Myra Marx Ferree, Beth Hess, and Patricia Yancey Martin [Ferree and Hess 2000; Ferree and Martin 1995], just to name a few scholars in the fields). Alongside the work of Patricia Hill Collins (2013), Maria Lugones (2003), Benita Roth (2004), Nira Yuval-­Davis (2011), and bell hooks (2015), this scholarship has become a model of thinking through social movement organization and its temporalities—­how and why groups might come together across a range of specific, timely issues or even syllabi (see also R. Lee 2000) and how we might see those crossings as generative even if they “end,” and end in failure. In a 1994 interview, Angela Davis cites Lorde and others in her bid for coalitional thought and political action: “There are more options than sameness, opposition, or hierarchical relations,” she asserts, later suggesting that “we need to be more reflective, more critical and more explicit about our concepts of community” across difference (Davis and Martinez 1994). Davis’s words are, in fact, foundational to the historians and social movement organizational theorists. She makes the case that the history of black feminist organization and thought is, by definition, coalitional—­with all of the nuances of temporality, “success,” and “leadership” that entails. She sets coalitional politics apart from the normative prescription of American politics to assume a universal standpoint for its citizens but also from the imperative of a homogenized minority position for any given social movement.</p>
<p>This turn to recognize the enduring depth of black feminist contributions to contemporary political life and thought is remarkable in at least two ways of anticipating future directions of African American and feminist studies: First, it works to undo African American political and cultural imperatives for a single great leader or leaders—­a model debunked by Erica R. Edwards in her 2012 <em>Charisma and the Fictions of Black Leadership</em> and one that has gained popular attention in the Black Lives Matter movement. It does this by claiming the significance of group political action as the history of black feminism, not just its new direction. Second, it foregrounds the primacy not just of the practice but of theories of coalition as the ground for contemporary, post–­civil rights feminist thought—­and of black feminists as the intellectual authors of this galvanizing force in the field of social justice. In backdating the history of coalition—­as a concept and as practice and as the primary narrative of the foundation of African American studies and feminist studies—­it clarifies the radical work that, yes, scholars such as Angela Davis, Audre Lorde, and others have done but also the work of collective praxis, thought, and intellectual articulation as central to the field. This can be traced through the iconic Combahee River Collective Statement to the <em>Home Girls</em> anthology (and also <em>This Bridge Called My Back</em> and <em>All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave</em> [Hull, Bell-­Scott, and Smith 1982], which paved the way for the transnational and multicultural feminist boom of anthological production of the late 1990s and early 2000s) to the myriad organizations that not only worked on everyday issues in their communities but also sought out various definitions of coalition—­from temporary to enduring ones—­to tackle intersectional issues.</p>
<p>These anthologies, in their multiracial, interdisciplinary makeup, stand as published enactments of coalition politics; in their use in ethnic and feminist studies classrooms, they insist on strategic alliances but also historical narratives of difference and difficulty as the basis for contemporary political thought. It is these instantiations of coalition politics that also make the word “coalition” so central to the thinking and doing of African American studies today and that look to the vibrant future of political thought across intersectional and interdisciplinary academic fields.</p>
