				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Diaspora” is a contested term. The African diaspora is, like the nation, an “imagined community” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/anderson-benedict/">(B. Anderson [1983] 2006)</a> conceived of and performed based on imperfect memories, evidence, and agendas. As the historian Colin Palmer asserts, “In many respects, diasporas are not actual but imaginary and symbolic communities and political constructs; it is we who often call them into being” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/palmer-colin-a/">(2000, 29)</a>. Within Black studies literatures, diaspora is mobilized as a method in pursuit of collectives whose histories and cultures were/are otherwise hidden or forcibly taken as part of the development of Western epistemes (formal and informal) and the violences of chattel slavery and colonialism. Variously referred to as “Black,” “African” or a series of national monikers prefixed by a version of “Afro-­,” the actors who called for the African diaspora are loosely tied together by a recognition of indigenous Africa as origin as well as a relation to Blackness as sociocultural identity. No more stable than “diaspora,” “Black(ness)” too is a contested term. The literary scholar Michelle Wright argues that “from the start, Black identity has been produced in contradiction” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/wright-michelle/">2004, 1</a>), noting the irregularity of the category and appellation as well as the fact that Blackness as production—­<em>becoming</em>—­and as material experience only exists relative to a series of additional constructions and world systems that produce “differences and disagreements among black populations on a number of registers” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/edwards-brent-hayes-se/">(B. Edwards 2003, 7)</a>. The word “diaspora,” then, invites experimentation within the categories of identity—­citizenship, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, and ability—­that the theorist Stuart Hall argued are “never complete, always in progress”<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/hall-stuart-se-2/"> (1990, 222)</a>. Diaspora as performance and practice is contested and (re)made over and over again, revealing its complexity and dynamism, which stems from the constant agitation among its subjects as well as the movements that disperse those persons around the globe. As such, the African diaspora is a people, process, encounter, ambition, and project.</p>
<p>More than a constellation of individuals, the African diaspora proves to be a political project of affiliation and camaraderie that unites members through historical condition as well as deliberate choice. Indeed, diaspora has been a formative element in the construction of modern Black identity. The language of an “African diaspora” rose to popularity in scholastic discourse in the 1950s and early 1960s in large part through the work of historians of Africa who brought grounding to the term through studies of anticolonial struggle in Ghana and other African nations. The popular birth of the term from and in continued reference to resistance movements necessarily makes the African diaspora a politically charged formulation designed to be read in contradistinction to structures of power. According to Lisa Brock, “if we rid ourselves of race and nation hierarchies, which were/are largely constructed at ‘the top’ by elites, important comparative paradigms might evolve and analytical lessons be drawn from isolating specific processes of oppression and the experiences of those below on ‘the bottom’” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/brock-lisa/">(1996, 11)</a>. Investment in scholastic inquiry “from below” is a hallmark of much of the work in the African diaspora, including that of the historian Robin D. G. Kelley, who has theorized new frames for Black resistance, arguing that “we have to step into the complicated maze of experience that renders ‘ordinary’ folks so extraordinarily multifaceted, diverse, and complicated. Most importantly, we need to break away from traditional notions of politics” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/kelley-robin-d-se/">(1994, 4)</a>. The “translocal” politics described by Frank Guridy <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/guridy-frank-andre/">(2010)</a> between poets in Havana and Harlem is one example of the ways in which scholars have shown the intimacies of diaspora and how those microrelationships became a defining element of influence and change on multiple scales. This revision to our understanding of politics, which is not held captive to formal organization, mass mobilizations, or charismatic leadership, opens up opportunities for examining how transnational cultures of thought and action function at the ground level and reveal the density and impact of diasporic contact.</p>
<p>Regularly used as a synonym for “African diaspora,” the term “Black Atlantic” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/gilroy-paul-se/">(Gilroy 1993)</a> brings with it a series of provocations detailing the fluidity of identities across the expanse of difference. Like Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/linebaugh-peter-and-marcus-rediker/">(2000)</a>, the literary scholar Omise’eke Tinsley details the intimacies that structured the transatlantic slave trade and intervenes in narratives of its formation by arguing that the “black Atlantic has always been the queer Atlantic” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/tinsley-omiseeke-natasha/">2008, 191</a>). Deep engagements with eroticism, desire, consumption, and masculinity widen the scope of global Blackness in consideration of how nonnormative bodies produce counterpoints to narratives of the family, respectability, and labor (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/allen-jafari/">J. Allen 2011</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/carrington-ben/">Carrington 2010</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/ferguson-roderick/">Ferguson 2004</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/thomas-deborah-a/">Thomas 2011</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/tinsley-omiseeke-natasha-se/">Tinsley 2010</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/williams-erica-lorraine/">Erica Williams 2013</a>). The intellectual investment in the Black Atlantic—­no less the Black Pacific and Black Mediterranean—­suggests that the buoyancy of Black cultures and identities have been built in between spaces and are supported by myriad strategies, including the creation of new knowledges. The ocean’s edge is a location of critical inquiry in diaspora studies and a location where feminist geographies become “demonic” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/mckittrick-katherine/">(McKittrick 2006)</a>, manifesting the crossing and “interrupt[ion] of inherited boundaries” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/alexander-m/">(M. Jacqui Alexander 2005, 6)</a> that show again how diaspora refuses containment, producing instead new constitutions and ways of living.</p>
<p>The African diaspora’s relation to the three “classic” diasporas (Jewish, Greek, and Armenian) was marked in the language of the First African Diaspora Studies Institute, which convened in 1979 at Howard University and offered this definition of the African diaspora: “the voluntary and forced dispersion of Africans at different periods in history and in several directions; the emergence of a cultural identity abroad without losing the African base, either spiritually or physically; the psychological or physical return to the homeland, Africa. Thus viewed, the African diaspora assumes the character of a dynamic, ongoing and complex phenomenon stretching across time and geography” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/harris-joseph-se-2/">(Harris [1982] 1993b, 5)</a>. This dynamism has been displayed in multiple forms, from the techniques of agricultural innovation carried by enslaved Senegalese women and men to the rice fields of the hemispheric Americas to the efforts by the African Union—­the cooperative continental governing organization—­in the late aughts of the new millennium to prioritize diaspora as a strategy of socioeconomic advance for Africa. These relations, in addition to many others forged through radicalisms and performance, index the coherence of the term, even when it is unevenly experienced or accessed. The “voluntary” aspect of the diaspora is witnessed through the multiple movements of Black peoples throughout the world due to ongoing independence struggles, crises in labor, and genocide that, following the forced dispersals of slavery and imperialism, extend diaspora’s teleology well into the future. Along with the dispersal of African-­descended subjects, Hazel Carby and Tina Campt encourage scholars of the African diaspora to reckon with the inter-­ and intranational “settling” of these populations, which requires investigation on different registers of Black existence. Similarly, the cultural theorist Paul Gilroy <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/gilroy-paul-se/">(1993)</a> famously suggested a focus on “routes” rather than “roots” in the African diaspora in order to trouble both the unidirectionality and racial essentialisms that impair diaspora study.</p>
<p>Africa holds a compelling and urgent location with the diaspora as a site of the “originary displacement,” as Nahum Chandler <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/chandler-nahum-dimitri/">(2000)</a> names it, tradition, and, in some cases, repatriation. As a sociocultural project, diaspora is reliant on the traditions and movements stemming from Africa, which stands as “a site of struggle and imagination but also as the progenitor of a flexible set of transferable knowledges of technique and performance” (Redmond 2014, 6). Yet, in spite of Africa’s centrality, it remains vulnerable to caricature, fancy, and/or outright dismissal in literatures of Blackness. The theorist Achille Mbembe argues that within Western discourse and scholarship, Africa—­“a great, soft, fantastic body”—­is an “object of experimentation” requiring constant supervision and intervention <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/mbembe-achille/">(2001, 8, 2)</a>. The mischaracterization and/or disarticulation of Africa from the wider African world haunts the field, leading diaspora scholars to imagine alternatives. Instead of “African diaspora,” the anthropologist Xavier Livermon <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/livermon-xavier/">(2018)</a> proposes the language of “Afrodiasporic,” which he argues mitigates against the scholastic and discursive erasure of Africa.</p>
<p>Africa’s representation as an entry to diaspora functions on at least two different registers: it is an opening into the long histories of culture, exploitation, and violence as well as a metaport or site of <em>re</em>entry. The traditional diasporic fixation with return to a homeland has rightly come under scrutiny in post–­civil rights African diaspora literatures. Unlike Greek, Armenian, and Jewish diasporas, there is no singular “home” or nation of origin for the African descended, making “return” more of a philosophical exercise than a practical aim or movement objective. That is not to say, however, that it has been pure fantasy. The influential diaspora theorist and movement icon Marcus Garvey is perhaps the most lionized advocate for Black repatriation in the postemancipation moment. His mantra of “Africa for Africans” and investment in a return to Africa was tied to gains in political power for global African peoples—­power that, due to colonialism and Western hegemony, could only take root on the continent. As he argued after World War I, in the cause of colonial expansion “white propagandists have been printing tons of literature to impress scattered Ethiopia, especially that portion within their civilization, with the idea that Africa is a despised place . . . where no human being should go, especially black civilized human beings” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/garvey-marcus-se/">(2004, 93)</a>. Though he never traveled to Africa and was only able to encourage the passage of a minimal number of members from the Universal Negro Improvement Association, return to Africa was a significant organizing strategy within diaspora, if not a tangible end, and carried weight well beyond the height of Garveyism in the 1920s. In a study of African American expatriates in postindependence Ghana, the historian Kevin Gaines documents a diverse group of activists and intellectuals whose various investments in Pan-­Africanism and Black nationalism led them to practice “a transnational culture of opposition to Western culture seeking the preservation of colonial and neocolonial dominance over the majority of the world’s peoples” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/gaines-kevin-k-se/">(2006, 12–­13)</a>. These legacies also encourage contemporary members of diaspora to chance their fate at “home” with mixed yet profound results, demonstrating again how Africa is imagined as a terrain of struggle that welcomes participation from its children near and far, even if those children initially are referred to as “stranger” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/hartman-saidiya-se-3/">(Hartman 2007)</a>.</p>
<p>Explorations of the multiple, intersectional identities in diaspora are a constituent part of its epistemological and political work. According to Brent Hayes Edwards African diaspora is a sign “formulated expressly through an attempt to come to terms with diverse and cross-­fertilized black traditions of resistance and anticolonialism” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/edwards-brent-hayes/">(2001, 53).</a> This critical offensive in the literature highlighted a multicentury diasporic assembly now theorized as the Black Radical Tradition and in so doing exposed submerged histories and performances of identity formation while also contending with Western thought, culture, and the very notion of “civilization.” Canonical Western epistemes were read as terrain for critical disruption and dismantling; as the social theorist Cedric Robinson argues, “Solon, Aristophanes, Plato, Isocrates, and Aristotle . . . all could not entirely conceal or effectively dismiss the moral challenges of the poor (<em>demos</em>), slaves, and women” ([<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/robinson-cedric-j/">1983] 2000, xxvii</a>). These subjects indeed surfaced, leaving a “record of resistance, for four centuries or more, from Nueva España to Nyasaland, [that] leaves in no doubt the specifically African character of those struggles” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/robinson-cedric-j/">5</a>). The shared concerns and qualities of these critiques and mobilizations indicate a corresponding labor from a coordinated body. Histories of radical organizing and movement building in the African world (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/bush-rod/">Bush 1999</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/gore-dayo-f/">Gore 2011</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/horne-gerald/">Horne 1997</a>, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/horne-gerald-se/">2014</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/kelley-robin-d/">Kelley [1990] 2015</a>, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/kelley-robin-d-se-3/">2002</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/makalani-minkah/">Makalani 2011</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/von-eschen-penny-m/">Von Eschen 1997</a>) have built on these synergies and demonstrate how Black subjects’ “defiant citizenship . . . gave way to diaspora through an identification with blackness as a condition of affinity and camaraderie beyond knowable signs and signals such as homeland, language, and appearance” (Redmond 2014, 127).</p>
<p>Elucidating the scenarios and circumstances that give rise to the African diaspora exposes how race is imagined, constructed, and repeated and why diaspora developed as “a means to theorize both culture and politics at the transnational level” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/edwards-brent-hayes/">B. Edwards 2001, 55</a>). That culture and politics are twinned in this description is not a coincidence. Culture is a formative element of political study in the African diaspora and has provided new idioms and methodologies in its study. Visual art and aesthetics (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/brody-jennifer-devere/">Brody 2008</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/brown-kimberly-juanita/">K.

Griffin 2013</a>), literature (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/carby-hazel-v-se-2/">Carby 1999</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/edwards-erica-r/">E. Edwards 2012</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/goyal-yogita/">Goyal 2010</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/moten-fred-se/">Moten 2003</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/nwankwo-ifeoma/">Nwankwo 2005</a>; David Scott 2004; Stephens 2005), and other artistic forms (and their breaks) materialize the continuities and disjunctures that constitute the African world. Due to music’s accessibility, ample supply, and demand in the global Commons and marketplace, it is perhaps the most resonant art form within diaspora. According to Samuel Floyd <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/floyd-samuel-a/">(1995)</a>, it is precisely the hearing and maintenance of African traditions throughout the long, global genealogies of Black music that constitutes its power. Black music is a hybrid tradition of diasporic exchange that exhibits a series of techniques and performances over time/space that according to the musicologist Olly Wilson are “not basically quantitative but qualitative” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/wilson-olly/">1983, 2</a>). In working against neat, determinate outcomes, engagements with Blackness as/in/through sound necessarily evince the sometimes messy and ephemeral nature of diaspora by exposing the significance of encounter, spontaneity, and rehearsal to its practice. Recent theoretical interventions in the study of the African diaspora, including “soundtexts,” “anthemic event,” and “stereomodernism,” variously articulate the ways in which musical productions have mediated and challenged the exclusions of access and citizenship faced by subjects throughout the African world (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/hill-edwin-c/">E. Hill 2013</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/redmond-shana-l/">Redmond 2014</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/jaji-tsitsi/">Jaji 2014</a>).</p>
<p>As a flexible and dynamic “way of life,” culture and its performance also have inspired some observers to invent or entrench diasporic essentialisms (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/williams-raymond/">Raymond Williams 1983</a>). While recognizing that continuity “in the work of Afro-­Americanists and Afro-­Caribbeanists is in part the measure of the sympathetically affirmative character of the anthropology of peoples of African descent in the New World,” David Scott has critiqued anthropological uses of “Africa” and “slavery” as synonyms for the “authentic past” of diasporic subjects (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/scott-david/">1991, 263</a>). While genealogies of diaspora may begin with the continent and/or enslavement, they are not the only openings to its examination, nor are either static phenomena. As scholars have amply documented, enslavement was not a uniform institution, nor was it totalizing in the lives of its captives (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/blassingame-john-w/">Blassingame [1972] 1979</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/brown-vincent/">V. Brown 2008</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/diouf-sylviane/">Diouf 2014</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/finch-aisha-k/">Finch 2015</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/gomez-michael-a/">Gomez 1998</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/morgan-jennifer-l/">Morgan 2004</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/roediger-david-r/">Roediger 2014</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/smallwood-stephanie-e/">Smallwood 2007</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/white-deborah-gray/">D. White [1985] 1999</a>). Similarly, the richness of African histories and cultures begs for a continuation of material readings that evade easy overtures to universalism and consensus while still being mindful of and holding onto the symbiotic approaches to life and living that occur globally (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/higginson-john/">Higginson 2014</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/kelley-robin-d-se-4/">Kelley 2012</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/pierre-jemima/">Pierre 2012</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/ray-carina-e/">Ray 2015</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/rodney-walter/">Rodney [1972] 1981</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/soyinka-wole/">Soyinka 2012</a>).</p>
<p>Presently caught between physical and state violence and (the violence of) neoliberal incorporation, the African descended worldwide are facing economic and political conditions that very well may widen the difference gap between their various communities. With African-­descended people having lived slavery and abolition in the U.S. and Britain and across the Caribbean and Latin America, colonialism and war in the clash of nations during World War I and II, and the genocide and imperialism that continue to outline the shape of global capital, one can know that the form and function of the African diaspora has not reached its end, perhaps not even its zenith. If we believe, as Cedric Robinson has written, that “the peoples of African and the African diaspora had endured an integrating experience that left them not only with a common task but a shared vision” ([<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/robinson-cedric-j/">1983] 2000, 166</a>), then we are left not with a tomb of dead practices but a canvas of invention that will hold the futures expressed and impressed on it, whatever they may be.</p>

Hard on the heels of the failures of Reconstruction, the persistence of white supremacy, and the legal codification of Jim Crow, “the color-­line” has remained an opening salvo for grappling with the conundrum of race and racial oppression on U.S. soil.</p>
<p>Yet, if one continues to read the adjoining words that follow Du Bois’s most famous utterance, one will note that his declaration extended far beyond the domestic confines of the United States. Indeed, the color-­line was “in the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia, in America and the islands of the sea” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/du-bois-w-se-4/">(1903, 13)</a>. The color-­line was global and crisscrossed oceans, continents, nations, and empires.</p>
<p>African life in the Western Hemisphere always sat at the vortex of Euro-­American empire as it evolved over four tumultuous centuries. The writer Toni Morrison <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/morrison-toni-se-4/">(1992)</a> has astutely observed that the transatlantic slave trade stamped African bodies as the first objectified subjects of the modern world. Without question, slavery made modernity possible, and the expansion of European empires paved the way for the colonization of the Americas, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is within this context that the field of African American studies (and its disciplinary corollaries: Africana studies, African diaspora studies, Caribbean studies, slavery studies, etc.) has been forced to wrestle with Euro-­American empire from its inception. This essay, however, focuses on the mid-­nineteenth century up through the twentieth and thematically considers how African Americans confronted and resisted empire at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Although Du Bois published <em>The Souls of Black Folks</em> in 1903, his global conception of “the color-­line” was in direct response to imperial expansion in both hemispheres. Across the Atlantic, Germany’s Chancellor Otto von Bismarck organized the Berlin Conference of 1884–­85 and formally ushered in the infamous “Scramble for Africa.” Fourteen European nations and the United States sent representatives to Berlin. In the wake of the conference, Germany, Belgium, Britain, France, Portugal, Spain, and Italy succeeded in dividing the continent into various spheres of colonial control.</p>
<p>The United States did not emerge with its own African spoils; however, it had expanded its imperial reach much closer to home. Indeed, U.S. colonialism began on its own shores. Armed with an Anglo-­Saxon drive for new territory and an unquenchable thirst for fossil fuels and precious metals, and buoyed by the philosophical justification of Manifest Destiny, U.S. empire took shape through the genocidal wars against indigenous peoples, considered collateral damage in the service of <em>progress</em>. As the U.S. Calvary pushed West, it also turned its barrels south and instigated a war with Mexico in 1846 under the pretense that the Rio Grande marked the true boundary between the two nations. Within two years, Mexico was defeated and forced to cede two-­thirds of its land to the United States.</p>
<p>After successive internal wars to subdue the indigenous peoples of North America and codify the settler-­colonial edifice of empire, the United States intervened in the Cuban War of Independence in 1898 and emerged a victor in full control of Spain’s colonial possessions. By seizing Cuba and annexing Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam, the late nineteenth century signaled a new day in U.S. empire.</p>
<p>Thus, the “the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia, in America and the islands of the sea,” which Du Bois so eloquently addressed in the opening passages of his classic text, were structured by a new imperial cartography of U.S. empire building. The historian Michael Krenn has noted that U.S. expansion in the nineteenth century grew out of a range of factors including economic depressions in the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s as a result of overproduction, glutted domestic markets, strained labor relations, and populist resistance to it all. Moreover, U.S. “military strategists, most notably Capt. Alfred Thayer Mahan, argued that a large navy was the key to power in the modern world” (2006, 36). U.S. naval prowess found justification in ideas of “survival of fittest,” popularized by Charles Darwin’s 1859 study <em>On the Origin of Species</em>. The pseudoscientific application of Darwinism only reinforced long-­standing racist practices that facilitated the devaluation and dehumanization of large swaths of humanity, a precursor to Euro-­American colonization.</p>
<p>African Americans, along with their counterparts throughout the African diaspora, resisted these practices. This resistance found formal expression through organizations as varied as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Urban League, the African Blood Brotherhood (ABB), and the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). As the U.S. Navy patrolled the Pacific and the southern Atlantic in search of new resources and markets, African Americans continued to endure the racist backlash of Reconstruction’s failures. Thus, U.S. imperial expansion abroad coincided with a renewed regime of racial terror at home, and nothing embodied this crisis more poignantly than the rise of lynching.</p>
<p>At the turn of the century, African American activists devoted significant organizational effort to combatting lynching. No figure embodied this fight more than the activist Ida B. Wells. Wells’s crusade for justice took her across the United States, yet, like the abolitionists before her, she traveled to England to educate and appeal to the moral conscience of the British public, some of whom found lynching reprehensible.</p>
<p>Wells made her first trip to England in 1893 under the invitation of English Quakers. After failing to raise money to support her activism on that trip, she returned to England in 1894 as an international correspondent for the <em>Daily Inter</em>-­<em>Ocean</em>, a Chicago-­based Republican newspaper opposed to lynching. Wells’s public speaking and incisive journalism moved British audiences and catalyzed some people to create antilynching organizations in England and beyond. Like abolitionists had decades earlier, Wells moved between an older empire (Britain) and an emerging one (United States), making the fight against lynching a global issue and placing the grievances of African Americans at the center a new geopolitical order that saw the United States emerging as a global superpower with colonial bounty scattered across the hemisphere.</p>
<p>Yet as U.S. empire expanded, others crumbled in the aftermath of World War I. By 1918, the German, Austrian-­Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian empires were no more. Against the backdrop of this massive geopolitical shift, black folk around the world continued to resist racial capitalism, white supremacy, and colonial domination. Drawing on older traditions of resistance rooted in Ethiopianism and Christian Revivalism, African people around the world found political refuge in redemptionist visions of Africa grounded in providential sensibilities that crisscrossed the black world.</p>
<p>It was within this context that the Jamaican migrant Marcus Mosiah Garvey established the headquarters for the UNIA in Harlem, New York, in 1916. Garvey’s arrival coincided with the first wave of the Great Migration that saw black southerners and Caribbean migrants pouring into northern cities in search of jobs, opportunity, and reprieve from Jim Crow and colonialism. Garvey’s Pan-­African vision and unprecedented organizational acumen resonated with the hopes and desires of a determined people committed to principles of self-­organization and self-­reliance. Indeed, the <em>Negro World</em>, the UNIA’s newspaper and primary organizational tool, circulated globally through the hands of black sailors and railroad workers both formally and informally.</p>
<p>The UNIA was monumental in the fight against Euro-­American empire that gripped and constrained black life in every corner of the globe. It would be a mistake, however, to measure its power and transformative gravitas by its organizational growth and decline or the life of Garvey himself. As Garveyism became localized, its presence could be felt in trade unions, religious organizations, and cultural celebrations that edified and reified black pride and dignity. As one scholar has noted, the global organizing efforts of black folk during the interwar years might be best understood as “the age of Garvey” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/ewing-adam/">(Ewing 2014)</a>.</p>
<p>Garveyism invigorated grassroots organizational activity among black working peoples around the world. During the World War II, the U.S. black press used its pages to link the African American fight for democracy to larger anticolonial struggles in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Black writers, activists, and intellectuals engaged in solidarity initiatives rooted in the common experiences of aggrieved communities directly shaped by slavery, racial capitalism, and colonial domination. Thus, the African American freedom struggle’s universalism grew out of a recognition of the inextricable linkages between Jim Crow, anticolonialism, and the global fight against Euro-­American colonialism as it recalibrated during World War II.</p>
<p>World War II was unquestionably a watershed period in the history of African Americans’ quest for full citizenship in the United States. Once the U.S. entered the war following Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the <em>Pittsburgh Courier</em>, the nation’s largest black newspaper, inaugurated its “Double V Campaign,” taking aim at ending fascism abroad and racism at home. In addition, fighting in the Pacific theater proved to be more complicated for black combatants in the U.S. Army. Unlike their white counterparts, African Americans had a long-­standing affinity for the Japanese that stretched back to the Russo-­Japanese War of 1905, in which Russia was defeated by a nation of color.</p>
<p>African American literature is replete with narratives of sympathy and adoration for Japan. In rereading these narratives, the literary scholar Etsuko Taketani suggests that we might conceptualize black participation in World War II as part of the “black Pacific,” which projected “a community imagined contrapuntally to [the] regional order in the making, in which a sense of belonging is manufactured by the performance of black narratives that invent history, one that African Americans imagine they share with the colored peoples of the Pacific Rim, especially Asia” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/taketani-etsuko/">2014, 6–­7</a>).</p>
<p>With Europe in shambles and Japan decimated by the atomic bomb, the United States ascended to world supremacy. African American journalists were careful to note that following the war, the United States began to extend its imperial reach into the Caribbean and South America. New military bases were established in Trinidad and Jamaica. The Jamaican Bauxite Company, a subsidiary of the Aluminum Company of America, garnered greater market share on the island. U.S. military presence in the region only reinforced the power and might of huge conglomerates such as United Fruit Company in such places as Surinam, where they had had a hold on national economies for decades.</p>
<p>For much of the rest of the century, African Americans resisted U.S. empire and called into question the ways in which U.S. foreign policy and militarism reinforced racism and bigotry at home. African American activism has remained critical to challenging American exceptionalism and underscoring the shortcomings of the professed virtues of American democracy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scholars of black life and culture have taken an interest in the notion of “family” from at least the turn of the twentieth century; W. E. B. Du Bois’s groundbreaking sociological study <em>The Philadelphia Negro</em> (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/du-bois-w-se-3/">1899</a>) devoted a chapter to “the Negro Family,” which explored everything from typical urban family size (significantly smaller than families in rural areas), variations in family income and expenditures across classes, and details of family life, including various types of cohabitation and child rearing. Notes Du Bois, “The home was destroyed by slavery, struggled up after emancipation, and is again not exactly threatened, but neglected in the life of city Negroes” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/du-bois-w-se-3/">([1899] 1996, 196)</a>. This emphasis on the deleterious consequences of slavery and plantation life for the black family forms a through line from Du Bois to later sociological and historical studies, perhaps most famously E. Franklin Frazier’s comprehensive <em>The Negro Family in the United States</em> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/frazier-e/">(1939)</a>, which argued that black family life had been deeply affected by slavery’s abuses and that the resultant fracturing of the nuclear family structure continued to reverberate in the black community of the early twentieth century.</p>
<p>Twenty-­five years later, the sociologist, senator, and assistant secretary of labor Daniel Patrick Moynihan relied heavily on Frazier’s work when drawing up the report, commissioned by President Lyndon B. Johnson, that became <em>The Negro Family: The Case for National Action</em> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/moynihan-daniel-p/">(1965)</a>. Moynihan’s report, which detailed what he called the “tangle of pathology” of black family life, argued that African American communities “ha[ve] been forced into a matriarchal structure which, because it is so out of line with the rest of the American society, seriously retards the progress of the group as a whole” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/moynihan-daniel-p/">(29)</a>. Moynihan’s report generated significant controversy not simply because of this claim about black matriarchy, which echoed the work of Frazier and other black sociologists and pundits writing in the 1960s, such as Kenneth Clark and Whitney Young, but because his work appeared to emphasize not structural racism and socioeconomic disadvantage as the cause of these issues within the black family but rather something dysfunctional inherent to black culture itself. Feminist critics of the report and of the controversy surrounding it have since pointed out the masculinist emphasis of much of the critique of Moynihan; most of Moynihan’s critics agreed with his assessment of black women as overly dominant within black households, as well as his argument that black families “reversed [the] roles of husband and wife” and thereby emasculated the black man <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/moynihan-daniel-p/">(30)</a>. Where such critics disagreed with Moynihan was on causes of and solutions to this issue: Moynihan’s work was repeatedly interpreted, precisely because of its emphasis on the “tangle of pathology,” as victim blaming (see, for instance, William J. Ryan’s 1971 response to Moynihan, <em>Blaming the Victim</em>) and as insufficiently attentive to the importance of jobs and other structural changes in potentially transforming black family life.</p>
<p>The Moynihan report’s continued influence in the latter years of the twentieth century, and even into the twenty-­first, is undeniable; the trope of black family “pathology” popularized by Moynihan continues to circulate in the United States, particularly in political commentary about black families from both ends of the political spectrum. If such commentary, divorced even from Moynihan’s research into the causes of such assumed “pathology,” rarely looked to the slave past to justify present-­day black struggles, research on the antebellum period that emerged in the years immediately following the civil rights era, including John W. Blassingame’s <em>The Slave Community</em> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/blassingame-john-w/">(1972)</a>, Eugene Genovese’s <em>Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made</em> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/genovese-eugene/">(1974)</a>, and Herbert G. Gutman’s <em>The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom</em> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/gutman-herbert-g/">(1977)</a>, actually questioned conventional wisdom about the fractured and fragile black family structure under slavery, instead emphasizing the way that enslaved blacks had formed crucial bonds on the plantation. These studies—­along with work such as Angela Davis’s “Reflections on the Black Woman’s Role in the Community of Slaves” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/davis-angela-y-se-2/">(1972)</a>, which explicitly countered the lingering belief in black “matriarchy” under conditions of enslavement, instead focusing on black women’s forced equality with their male counterparts, as well as their insurgent resistance—­opened a critical space for scholars of African American history and culture to attend to different forms of “family” and kinship structure than the heteropatriarchal <em>nuclear</em> family. The anthropologist Carol Stack’s <em>All Our Kin</em> (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/stack-carol/">1974</a>) is a notable example of this sort of critical reframing of notions of “family” and attention to how impoverished blacks nonetheless found ways to share resources and create lasting kinship bonds even under difficult material circumstances.</p>
<p>The nuclear “family,” which, as the feminist literary scholar Hortense Spillers famously argued in her groundbreaking <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/spillers-hortense-j/">1987</a> essay “Mama’s Baby, Papa’s Maybe: An American Grammar Book,” is a discursive and ideological institution deeply implicated by histories of white supremacy and racist violence, has also and as a result been a central means by which captive black bodies had been excluded from “Western” conceptions of gender and culture: “It seems clear, however, that ‘Family,’ as we practice and understand it ‘in the West’—­the <em>vertical</em> transfer of a bloodline, of a patronymic, of titles and entitlements . . .—­becomes the mythically revered privilege of a free and freed community” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/spillers-hortense-j/">74</a>). Spillers’s work spoke back to and paved the way for other black women’s writing on “family” that highlighted the institution’s fraught history and the ways that the word “family,” particularly in its narrowest senses, has operated as a disciplinary term—­with those who are disciplined <em>by</em> the concept overwhelmingly black women, the mothers, sisters, daughters, and wives whose behavior within the embattled black family unit has so often been scrutinized and found wanting. A great deal of this writing has taken place not in the sphere of scholarship and analysis but in that of fiction.</p>
<p>Published in the same year as Spillers’s essay, Toni Morrison’s Pulitzer Prize–­winning novel <em>Beloved</em> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/morrison-toni-se-2/">(1987)</a> explores both the traumatic mechanics of slavery’s decimation of black patriarchal “family”—­husbands and wives, parents and children separated; intrafamilial violence; the haunting presence of those who are lost—­as well as the less conventional “family” bonds that the enslaved nonetheless forged and the ways that such bonds sustained and fortified slavery’s victims and survivors. Other critically acclaimed works by black women, such as Alice Walker’s <em>The Color Purple</em> (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/walker-alice/">1982</a>), also a Pulitzer Prize–­winning novel, Ntozake Shange’s <em>For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow Is Enuf</em> (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/shange-ntozake/">1975</a>), and Gloria Naylor’s <em>The Women of Brewster Place</em> (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/naylor-gloria/">1982</a>), not only questioned the restrictive definitions of “family” that continued to be applied to black Americans, portraying a number of alternative forms of kinship and familial connection, including same-­gender relationships, but also examined the ways that domestic violence and other intimate abuses by African American men disrupted the black heteropatriarchal “family” from within.</p>
<p>The hostile response to these works by some black male reviewers and critics—­see, for instance, the sociologist Robert Staples’s “The Myth of the Black Macho: A Response to Angry Black Feminists” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/staples-robert-se-3/">1979</a>)—­led the scholar Deborah McDowell to pen the essay “Reading Family Matters” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/mcdowell-deborah/">(1989)</a>, in which she calls such figures’ critical reliance on a “totalizing fiction” of African American community wholeness, a story of “the Black Family cum Black Community headed by the Black Male who does battle with an oppressive White world,” a black “family romance” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/mcdowell-deborah/">(78)</a>. In the world of media, this black family romance found expression in television via a number of popular series depicting African American family life, including <em>Good Times</em> (1974–­79), <em>The Jeffersons</em> (1975–­85), <em>227</em> (1985–­90), <em>Family Matters</em> (1989–­98), <em>Roc</em> (1991–­94), and, perhaps best known and most influential, <em>The Cosby Show</em>, which ran from 1984 to 1992 and depicted a wealthy professional black couple and their five children. Experts disagree about the ultimate value of the “positive image” of the black family that Cosby portrayed, with the sociologist Herman Gray arguing in 1995, for instance, that despite the show’s groundbreaking exploration of diversity <em>within</em> blackness, with its specific focus on the black upper middle class, the show “seemed unable, or unwilling, to negotiate its universal appeals to family, the middle class, mobility, and individualism on the one hand and the particularities of black social, cultural, political, and economic realities on the other” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/gray-herman/">(81–­82)</a>. Yet the show’s meaning and legacy as a powerful cultural image of “family” has perhaps been troubled most by the long list of sexual-­assault allegations leveled against an aging Bill Cosby, which ultimately challenge the show’s validity as an idealized black household that purportedly was based on Cosby’s own equally ideal family life.</p>
<p>McDowell’s work on the family romance highlights another common but contested use of the word “family” in African American communities, as a marker of <em>racial</em> belonging; understanding the larger black community as a “family” has been signaled, historically, by linguistic and discursive gestures such as the “brothers and sisters” of the civil rights and Black Power movements, a form of address that grows out of similar language common to the black church. And while the more inclusive term “sibling” is growing in popularity as African Americans who identify as transgender become more visible and vocal about the ways that words such as “brothers” and “sisters” can be exclusionary, the very language of “family” as a metaphor for black community has also been questioned in some quarters, most notably by the black British scholar Paul Gilroy. Gilroy, in his 1991 essay “‘It’s a Family Affair’: Black Culture and the Trope of Kinship,” critiqued the way that the metaphor of “family” reduced “the crisis of black politics and social life” to “a crisis of black masculinity alone” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/gilroy-paul/">(204)</a> and predicted that “disastrous consequences follow when the family supplies the only symbols of political agency we can find in the culture and the only object upon which that agency can be seen to operate” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/gilroy-paul/">(207)</a>. Ultimately a critique of U.S.-­centric racial politics, Gilroy’s analysis emphasized that alternative forms of community building, such as those found in transnational or global diasporic contexts, might prove a more fruitful and inclusive way of conceptualizing community.</p>
<p>The word “family” as a signal of membership has also circulated within black queer and LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) communities, as a means of recognizing and embracing those who are open or closeted members. The sociologist Mignon Moore is one of few scholars who have examined how conventional notions of “family” are embraced and also contested by black LGBT subjects; her book <em>Invisible Families: Gay Identities, Relationships, and Motherhood among Black Women</em> (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/moore-mignon/">2011</a>) argues that “the family life of gay women of color has for many years been largely invisible to African Americans” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/moore-mignon/">(2)</a> and uses ethnography to explore “how Black lesbians’ participation in and enactment of their intersecting identities as Black, as women, and as gay people influence family formation, mate selection, expectations for partners in intimate relationships, and other aspects of family life” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/moore-mignon/">(3)</a>. Notably, with the landmark 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling <em>Obergefell v. Hodges</em>, same-­sex marriage became legal in all fifty states, making it possible for existing LGBT families to seek legal protections from the state that had previously been denied.</p>
<p>While stereotypes about the brokenness or pathology of the black family continue to circulate in the twenty-­first century, recent scholarship continues to refute such perceptions; a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report from 2013 for instance, details how black fathers are actually as involved, if not more involved, with child rearing as white or Latino fathers in similar living situations, debunking the persistent myth of the “absent” black father (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/jones-jo-and-william-d/">Jones and Mosher 2013</a>). That this myth persists—­alongside other oft-­repeated narratives about the black family in “crisis”—­may explain why African American families continue to face higher levels of scrutiny from the state. One result is that black children are overrepresented in foster care, despite statistics that indicate that “children of all races are equally as likely to suffer from abuse and neglect” (see the U.S. Government Accountability Office’s 2007 report, <em>African American Children in Foster Care</em>). As African American studies continues its work in the twenty-­first century, “family” is sure to continue as a complex and contested term, with an array of meanings that are shaped by, but strive to move beyond, black history in the U.S. and around the globe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Derived from the Latin word <em>genus</em>, which refers to a race, class, or kind of something, “gender” shares its root word with concepts such as “genre,” “genealogy,” “genetics,” and “genius,” among others. Its etymology provides a partial context for how the term is frequently deployed to describe a finite system of types that are indexical of a bipartite model of sex to confer either a masculine or feminine designation. Among humans, and with an implied binaristic model of gender intact, gender is conceptualized as the product of a patriarchal ordering of difference invested in maintaining a relation of male dominance to female subordination. Although gender is colloquially used to refer to a generalizable typology to designate species into “men,” “women,” and sometimes “transgender” or nonbinary categories, such usage for black and blackened people is, at best, imprecise and, at worst, obscurant given gender’s arrangement with race and other modalities of difference.</p>
<p>Gender’s structures of meaning and attendant incoherences are particularly legible when situated alongside violent forces of racialization, which have indelibly shaped gender as a system of signification. The production of gender as a naturalized category calcified at the height of the European colonial era, and each node of the slave trade produced a critical environment for the numerous ways gender was articulated, disarticulated, and lived. As Hortense Spillers explains in her noted essay “Mama’s Baby, Papa’s Maybe: An American Grammar Book” in reference to the ordering of the New World, a project that would require both the theft of land and the theft of body, “Under these conditions, we lose at least gender difference in the outcome, and the female body and the male body become a territory of cultural and political maneuver, not at all gender-­related, gender specific” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/spillers-hortense-j/">1987, 67</a>). Spillers notes, “in th[is] historic outline of dominance, the respective subject-­positions of ‘female’ and ‘male’ adhere to no symbolic integrity” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/spillers-hortense-j/">66</a>). Rather, gender and what are often linked as cognate concepts, namely, the body and sexuality, are disarticulated for black and indigenous people in an American grammar produced by settler colonialism and chattel slavery.</p>
<p>As particular historical conditions constitute the grounds for the “ungendering” of blackness within a dominant symbolic order, Sylvia Wynter and others have gestured toward different semiotic arrangements that more accurately describe the particular expressivities of racialized gender. In an afterword to a collection of essays written by Caribbean women critics, Wynter uses William Shakespeare’s <em>The Tempest</em> to provide one explanation for how forces of racialization, in their colonial manifestations, alter orders of difference such that “<em>sex-­gender attributes</em> are no longer the primary index of ‘deferent’ difference, and in which the discourse that erects itself is no longer primarily ‘patriarchal,’ but rather ‘monarchal’ in its Western-­European, essentially post-­Christian, post-­religious definition” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/wynter-sylvia/">1990, 358</a>, emphasis in original). For Wynter, colonization and the establishment of a symbolic ordering to articulate colonial rule shifts “the primacy of the <em>anatomical</em> model of sexual difference . . . to that of the <em>physiognomic</em> model of racial/cultural difference,” such that encounters between different genders in this context are as much, or perhaps more, marked by the colonial rubric of racial domination as mere sexual (anatomical) difference (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/wynter-sylvia/">ibid</a>.). Suggesting monarchal logic, expressed as the relationship of ruler over servants, gestures toward an alternative logic for how gender is assigned, as Wynter offers a rearrangement of the patriarchal formulation of the father over household to address how gender shifts according to its racial and sociohistorical contexts.</p>
<p>In matters of production and reproduction, race assembles the body, such that it proliferates gender (see, e.g., <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/morgan-jennifer-l/">Morgan 2004</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/hartman-saidiya/">Hartman 1996</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/haley-sarah/">Haley 2016</a>). In “Seduction and the Ruses of Power,” for example, Saidiya Hartman argues for the “divergent production of the category woman,” as she focuses on the legal and cultural responses to rape of enslaved women in the United States <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/hartman-saidiya/">(1996, 556)</a>. For Hartman, gender, as it is produced through forced sex between slavers and the enslaved, constructed a female subject position, in which the “erasure or disavowal of sexual violence engendered black femaleness as a condition of unredressed injury, which only intensified bonds of captivity and the deadening objectification of chattel status” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/hartman-saidiya/">(556)</a>. While Hartman is careful not to produce a false equivalence between violence and gender, her argument underscores the psychic dimensions of gender with regard to injury, as it also reiterates how the meanings of gender are multiplied in light of the sexual violence that constituted chattel slavery.</p>
<p>Within the realms of lived experience, gender provides an aperture into modes of survival and personal or collective experiences of vitality (or lack thereof). Womanist and black feminist scholarship and activism have provided numerous rubrics for understanding how gender shapes one’s experiences of blackness, emphasizing the importance of self-­determination and self-­definition (see, e.g., <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/lorde-audre/">Lorde 1984</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/walker-alice-se/">A. Walker 1983</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/combahee-river-collective/">Combahee River Collective 1978</a>). Attention to gender’s analytic utility within black communities has produced, for example, meaningful critiques of male chauvinism within black liberation movements or careful documentation of how sexism privileges nontransgender men within some iterations of a black studies canon (see, e.g., <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/edwards-erica-r/">E. Edwards 2012</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/carby-hazel-v-se/">Carby 1998</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/bambara-toni-cade-ed-se/">Bambara 1981</a>). Black masculinity studies has also brought focused attention to the gendering of African American and African-­descended males and to the interrelatedness of black masculine gendering and black politics across the long twentieth century and has made use of textual, psychoanalytic, and spatial analyses to draw links between masculinity and blackness, as a lived category and as a potent vehicle for racial representation (see, e.g., <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/ross-marlon/">M. Ross 2004</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/harper-phillip-brian/">P. Harper 1996</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/richardson-riche/">Richardson 2007</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/marriott-david/">Marriott 2000</a>). Within the field, concepts such as “hypermasculinity,” which describes a racist projection onto black males in which black men are reduced to their genitalia, which is itself magnified—­and retroactive responses to that projection—­have come to explain how black masculinities are experienced and represented as hyperbolically masculine and therefore in excess to dominant codes of masculinity (see, e.g., Poulson-­Bryant 2005; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/fanon-frantz-se-2/">Fanon [1967] 2008</a>). Furthermore, scholarship on the related concepts “the culture of dissemblance,” “the politics of respectability,” and “the salvific wish” highlight how black women practiced and espoused distinctly gendered modes of self-­protection and policing in reaction to or to guard against antiblack racism and violence (see, e.g., <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/hine-darlene-clark-se-2/">Hine 1989</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/higginbotham-evelyn-brooks/">E. Higginbotham 1993</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/white-e/">E. White 2001</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/jenkins-candice-m/">Jenkins 2007</a>).</p>
<p>Lived experiences of gender have also received considerable focus in scholarship within black queer and transgender studies, in which many scholars have attended to the performative dimensions of gender in order to highlight its contingent and situational production. For example, Marlon Bailey’s study of contemporary ballroom culture, defined as “a community and network of Black and Latina/o women, men, and transgender women and men who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, straight, and queer,” describes a five-­part “gender system” that structures how members are adjudicated in ballroom competitions across North America <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/bailey-marlon/">(2011, 367)</a>. The black trans studies scholars Enoch Page and Matt Richardson, moreover, have brought attention to transubjectivity as a concept to examine how gender remains a possible terrain to examine how black people have negotiated oppression <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/page-enoch-and-matt-richardson/">(2010, 62–­63)</a>. The possible connections between black studies and transgender studies are manifold in light of this discussion so far. Namely, as scholarship on black genders has frequently expressed how black genders are figured outside the traditional symbolics of “male” and “female,” black studies functions as a generative site for exploring how gender nonconformity and transness are imagined and experienced.</p>
<p>In the preface to <em>Feminist Studies</em>’ “Race and Transgender Studies: A Special Issue,” Matt Richardson and Leisa Meyer make explicit a critique of the limitations “of a predominantly white referent for transgender subjectivity as currently represented in critical theory” (2011, 247). Taking queer of color critique as a referent, “trans of color critique,” as a field of inquiry, has emerged as a scholarly articulation of the necessity of reading imbrications of racial formations and trans/gendered practices simultaneously. Like its scholarly forebear, trans of color critique is less a response to the perceived whiteness of transgender studies than a field constituted by an insistence on thinking racial and transgender concerns alongside and in light of other modes of difference (see, e.g., <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/page-enoch-and-matt-richardson/">Page and Richardson 2010</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/snorton-c-2/">Snorton and Haritaworn 2013</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/wallace-julia-r/">Wallace and Green 2013</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/green-kai-m/">Green and Ellison 2014</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/cotten-trystan-t/">Cotten 2011;</a> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/snorton-c/">Snorton 2017</a>). Writings by trans activists and intellectuals, such as CeCe McDonald <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/mcdonald-cece/">(2015)</a>, for example, draw attention to the ways prisons and carceral logics express the personal vulnerabilities and political stakes of practices of black and trans self-­determination.</p>
<p>In the broadest sense, gender, in all of its manifestations, is another metric of black self-­invention. Relatedly, gender as an analytic becomes a critical mode to examine how blackness is lived and experienced. Whether gender is explored in relation to the frequently violent ways it has been given and enforced or in light of the ways it has been (strategically) deployed and redefined, scholarship on gender highlights a terrain of black life. Thus, gender might be understood as a testament to the unruly, monstrous, and marvelous ways blackness persists in the midst of ongoing forms of violence and violation. Put simply, scholarship on black genders reveals how gender (and sexuality) is as multiplicative as power is diffuse.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is race? Over time and space, many people have asked that very question. However, there is no universal definition or universally agreed-­on response to this query, largely because the concept of race, born out of Europe and disseminated across the globe, is a human invention.</p>
<p>“The term <em>race</em>,” argue the sociologist Karen Fields and the historian Barbara Fields <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/fields-karen-e/">(2012, 16)</a> “stands for the conception or the doctrine that nature produced humankind in distinct groups, each defined by inborn traits that its members share and that differentiate them from the members of other distinct groups of the same kind but of unequal rank.” How race articulates through our “mental terrain” and infiltrates our belief system results from what these scholars refer to as “racecraft,” meaning “a kind of fingerprint evidence that <em>racism</em> has been on the scene” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/fields-karen-e/">(18, 19)</a>. The anthropologist Jemima Pierre<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/pierre-jemima/"> (2012, xii)</a> locates “racecraft” in the structures of “European empire making” and defines it in her study of race and blackness in Ghana as “the design and enactment, practice, and politics of race making.” In this way, race is not a matter of real and/or ascribed difference but one of artifice, currency, hierarchy, and inevitable insurgent counternarratives in ongoing struggles for human and self-­recognition.</p>
<p>Today, there is a general consensus that race is a social construct or, more simply put, man-­made. This understanding radically discredits the notion of race as something biological and thus indicative of racial purity, an entity born of nature and located in our DNA. Even so, as the famous proposition by William I. and Dorothy Swain Thomas reminds us, “If [people] define situations to be real, they are real in their consequences” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/thomas-william-i/">1928, 572</a>), an observation confirmed by the prevailing beliefs in biological inferiority that the theorem’s namesake and his scholarly contemporaries also espoused during their time and/or evaded in everyday life (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/reed-adolph-l-se/">A. Reed 1997</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/steinberg-stephen/">Steinberg 2007</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/morris-aldon/">Morris 2015</a>). Race and racism are not mere social constructs but political, lived, and at times deadly experiences that play a fundamental and intersectional role in the everyday because they are deeply ingrained in our social institutions, ranging from family to education to economics to law (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/king-deborah/">King, 1988</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/crenshaw-kimberle-se/">Crenshaw 1991</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/essed-philomena/">Essed 1991</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/collins-patricia-hill-se/">Collins 1998</a>). According to the philosopher Charles Mills <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/mills-charles-w/">(1998, 49–­50)</a>, “race has not been an arbitrary social category . . . or an innocent designation, as in a horizontal system, but has functioned as a real marker . . . of privilege and subordination in a vertical system” in which race and racism lie at the core of the social contract. Still, the recognition and knowledge that race is socially constructed does not tell us what race means, of what it is constructed, nor does it solve the race problem. As the anthropologist Audrey Smedley has written, it only means that we have reached conceptual clarity of race as “a social/cultural reality that exists in a realm independent of biological or genetic variations” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/smedley-audrey/">2007, 1</a>).</p>
<p>From a sociohistorical perspective, race can be regarded as a social category that descends from nineteenth-­century scientific racism, or race as biology, and its claims of biological determinism. The evolutionary biologist Joseph L. Graves Jr. (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/graves-joseph-l/">2015, 25</a>) explains biological determinism as “the notion that there is a simple relationship between inherent (biological/genetic) features of human beings and their position in society.” On this idea, the causes of disadvantage or conversely advantage are not located in our social institutions but rather in our so-­called races, in other words, in our blood or more precisely in our genes. Per this logic, race is biology, and biology is destiny from which there is no escape. Although multiple sciences substantiate that race is not a meaningful genetic or biological concept, this knowledge has not eliminated racial essentialism, racialization of categories, and the reification of race in genetic research, particularly for the purposes of population labeling. Certain biomedical research and for-­profit industries find common interests in this labeling and “classification standardization”—­that is, “the alignment of genetics classification with the racial classifications of powerful institutions” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/panofsky-aaron-and-catherine-bliss/">Panofsky and Bliss 2017, 62</a>). This standardization is integral, for instance, not only to race-­specific pharmaceuticals but also to the billion-­dollar industry of genetic ancestry testing that harbors and at times fosters essentialist assumptions about race (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/duster-troy/">Duster [1990] 2003</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/roberts-dorothy-se/">D. Roberts 2011</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/kahn-jonathan/">Kahn 2012</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/nelson-alondra/">Nelson 2016</a>). The sociologists Aaron Panofsky and Catherine Bliss (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/panofsky-aaron-and-catherine-bliss/">2017, 61</a>) expose an often-­overlooked dimension to these issues: “the ambiguous and flexible ways that geneticists classify human populations and differences. . . . Geneticists are typically embarrassed that they have considerable difficulty articulating coherent definitions of race or racial classification, even though both are deployed in their research.” These findings are not at variance with the fact that race is a social construct. Indeed, they ultimately reinforce that very point by demonstrating that human manipulation maps “race” onto human diversity, not natural forces.</p>
<p>More importantly, what science and opportunity have unequivocally shown is that race is not indicative of intelligence, political and moral status, musical aptitude, athleticism, or other complex abilities, as scientific racism dictates. Social movements aimed at advancing opportunities and the inclusion of marginalized and racialized groups have broken glass ceilings in nearly every profession in ways that further belie and delegitimate beliefs in racial inferiority and superiority. This is not to assert, however, that there is no biological impact or damage to groups socially defined as “races.” Scholars and medical professionals have long documented correlations between health disparities due to environmental conditions, such as the deliberate placing of hazardous-­waste sites in proximity to already-­segregated, low-­income, “minority” neighborhoods, or lead in the water supply, or the stressors of racism and their impact on infant mortality rates—­all of which result from human intervention.</p>
<p>As the theorist Roderick A. Ferguson (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/ferguson-roderick-se-2/">2007, 191</a>) has written, “The study of race incorporates a set of wide-­ranging analyses of freedom and power. The scope of those analyses has much to do with the broad application of racial difference to academic and popular notions of epistemology, community, identity, and the body . . . [as well as] economic and political formations.” For example, those power formations obscure how human beings have arbitrarily selected which traits carry social significance when fashioning categories that define a specific group. Category formation in the hands of Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, a German Enlightenment thinker, anatomist, and naturalist, illustrates well the pure randomness of race-­making through his “naming” white people “Caucasian.” On the basis of his personal assessment that people of the Caucasus region, situated at the border of Europe and Asia, were the most beautiful in the world and the cradle of humanity, Blumenbach established a category of whiteness that endures to this day (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/gould-stephen-jay/">Gould 1994</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/painter-nell-se-2/">N. Painter 2010</a>).</p>
<p>Race may have originated as a European folk idea about human differences, traceable to the “Age of Discovery” during the fifteenth century, but by the eighteenth century, the idea had crystalized into a pseudoscientific categorical fact. Derived from high-­stakes philosophical discourses about differences between humans and those who were ultimately written out of humanity, these explanations informed a number of academic fields that perpetuated race-­making, among them anthropology, geography, medicine, sociology, and theology (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/eze-emmanuel-chukwudi-ed/">Eze 1997</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/bernasconi-robert/">Bernasconi 2001</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/ferguson-roderick/">Ferguson 2004</a>). Critical medievalists, such as Geraldine Heng <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/heng-geraldine/">(2011)</a>, reject this canonical periodization on the basis of multiple sources, dating from the thirteenth century, that appear to frustrate narrowly etched race chronologies. Similar to the political scientist Cedric Robinson ([1983] 2000), Heng found that that there is compelling evidence of “racial thinking, racial law, racial formation, and racialized behaviors and phenomena in medieval Europe before the emergence of a recognizable vocabulary of race” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/heng-geraldine/">(2011, 268)</a>. These ideas also found fertile ground in Christian theology’s contribution to the modern racial imagination, enshrined in interpretations of the curse on Ham, the putative father of Black Africa, with heritable servitude. The sociologist David Goldenberg’s<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/goldenberg-david-m/"> (2003)</a> exegetical study of the uses of this allegory to rationalize racial slavery shows, however, the absence of referential antiblackness in this story, which has been ironically passed down over thousands of years to justify the enslavement of racialized black bodies throughout the Atlantic world (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/gomez-michael-a-se/">Gomez 2005</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/diouf-sylviane/">Diouf 2014</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/johnson-rashauna/">R. Johnson 2016</a>). Still, as Toni Morrison <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/morrison-toni-se-4/">(1992, 49)</a> judiciously recognizes, there is “a long history on the meaning of color” that signified “not simply that [a] slave population had a distinctive color; it was that this color ‘meant’ something,” something antithetical to that against which it was defined and thereby made to matter: whiteness. Color is not race, but it serves often as its surrogate, and, as with race, it is no more biologically predictive of who we are or will be than are ear or shoe size.</p>
<p>Framed this way, it is insufficient to say that race is socially constructed or to advocate, as do color/raceblind adherents, the purging or effacement of the idea with the expectation and/or hope that doing so will mitigate or nullify the effects of the concept’s protracted and destructive career in the world. Race has a material life whose definition has never been fixed, precisely because it is a product of human perception that dominant groups have wielded to preserve their position of dominance. As the cases of Nazi Germany, racial passing, and Rwanda show, people must be taught or compelled to see race when it is not discernable through selected racialized markers in a society (i.e., skin color, features, body type, hair texture, language, clothing, names, identity cards, or zip codes), again the stuff of racial categorization. Nonetheless, racial meaning and causality are created in their absence, as the theorist Michelle Wright elucidates similarly in her analysis of the phenomenology of blackness, a blackness ascribed, assumed, and/or performed by a variety of diasporic bodies, some of which are not always apprehended as black. “Blackness,” she argues, “operates as a construct (implicitly or explicitly defined as a shared set of physical and behavioral characteristics) and . . . phenomenological[ly] (imagined through individual perceptions in various ways depending on the context)” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/wright-michelle-se/">2015, 4</a>). The social and legal principle of the “one-­drop rule,” white supremacy’s definition of blackness, exemplifies well her point, as it asserts that African ancestry, real or imagined, defines a person as black, thus inferior.</p>
<p>That race is so historically entrenched in a society begs several questions: Is it possible or even desirable to negotiate, become “liberated” from, or transcend race without recourse to the “master’s tools,” chief among them being the term and concept of race themselves? What, if anything, is redemptive about race? What of its life-­saving effects: communities, solidarities, pride, pleasure, traditions, and the arts that evolved in response to its imposition, its distortions, and a complicity with it that obtains without explicit demand (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/du-bois-w-se/">W. Du Bois 1897a</a>, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/du-bois-w-se-4/">1903</a>, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/du-bois-w-se-11/">[1935] 1998</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/woodson-carter-g/">Woodson 1933</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/fanon-frantz-se-2/">Fanon [1967] 2008</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/appiah-anthony-se/">Appiah 1992</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/gordon-lewis-r/">L. Gordon 1999</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/gilroy-paul-se-3/">Gilroy 2000</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/outlaw-lucius-t/">Outlaw 2014</a>)? The violence of race is not often recognized institutionally, neither is it one-­directional, as the decolonial theorist Aimé Césaire <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/cesaire-aime/">([1972] 2000)</a> makes plain: the dehumanizer becomes dehumanized in that very process and thereby amputated from all humanity in order to rationalize and justify that violence. Race, then, is not destiny, but it can often feel that way.</p>
<p>The fact that race is invented suggests strongly that it can be whatever people define it to be. However, the concept, its deployment, its persistence, and its ultimate purpose—­racial rule for capitalist gain—­are intimately linked to politics and power that rely on coercion (i.e., violence, threats, and pressure) and consent for their existence. In the logic of Antonio Gramsci, “hegemony operates by including its subjects [and] incorporating its opposition,” argues the sociologists Michael Omi and Howard Winant (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/omi-michael-and-howard-winant/">1994, 68</a>; cf. <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/feagin-joe-and-sean-elias/">Feagin and Elias 2012</a>). To accomplish this end, “the ruling groups must elaborate and maintain a popular system of ideas and practices—­through education, the media, religion, folk wisdom, etc.” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/omi-michael-and-howard-winant/">Omi and Winant 1994, 67</a>). It is through this inculcated knowledge that society’s consent occurs so that the dominant group’s ways of thinking and being in the world appear natural, reasonable, indeed in society’s collective interest, despite resistance and at times because of it.</p>
<p>A common, salient illustration from my research in metropolitan France concerns the international practice of repetitive identity checks or stop-­and-­frisks performed by “ethnically” diverse law enforcers, which include large, frequently black security guards in places of commerce. In a climate of “normalcy,” these individuals, imbued with the authority of the state, profile and stop youth racialized as black or Arab not for what they have done but for what they are <em>perceived to be</em>, particularly in public space, where their already-­demonized bodies are deemed incongruous with the norm. As a demonstration of that authority, they are routinely harassed in their neighborhoods, located in segregated areas where relations with the police are little more than relations of force. Should they resist or self-­defend, even as a reflex reaction to a policing aggression or attack, an already-­humiliating situation quickly escalates to detainment, physical violence, or death by a militarized police force against “suitable enemies,” long racialized as delinquents, terrorist in the making, or/and an immigrant threat (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/keaton-trica/">Keaton 2006</a>, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/keaton-trica-se/">2013</a>). It is not surprising that movements such as Black Lives Matter are both local and global and firmly within worldwide traditions of antiracism struggles for human and civil rights (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/taylor-keeanga-yamahtta/">K. Taylor 2016</a>). Meanwhile, media-­savvy, though solutionless, politicians and social analysts (from the left and the right) respond to race problems by denying their existence or resorting to proxy issues, such as immigration and cultural pathology. In so doing, they deflect attention from racism and racial discrimination, intersected by socioeconomic precarity, for which they have no viable answers in a supposed post-­race and post-­truth era. Scapegoating marginalized groups for their marginalization remains, then, a tried and tested mechanism to exculpate that same society (i.e., people and their institutions) for having structured race-­based and intersectional exclusions as both desired and acceptable.</p>
<p>Everything old becomes new again, as revivals of explicit authoritarian white nationalism and supremacy well illustrate, particularly during high-­stakes elections. In the language of the sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-­Silva (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/bonilla-silva-eduardo/">2001, 6</a>), who captures the global implications of these issues beyond the site of his research in the U.S., “present-­day victim-­blamers, as their older cousins, believe (1) that government interventions on behalf of minorities is a waste of time and money,” that is, against white interests and dominance, irrespective of class and gender, “and (2) that racial and class-­based stratification is an irrelevant factor in understanding black/white inequality.” This latter point also renders inconsequential, if not invisible, inequality suffered by other racialized groups in societies whose extreme racial outer limits continue to be constituted in terms of variations on whiteness and anything-­but-­blackness. When framed by racial hegemony, practices such as mass incarceration and deportation enjoy public approval when scripted as crime and apprehended as a matter of individuals’ moral or cultural deficiencies and/or a threat to dominate groups (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/elias-norbert/">Elias 1965</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/mamdani-mahmood-se-2/">Mamdani 2002</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/davis-angela-y-se-6/">A. Davis 2003</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/wacquant-loic/">Wacquant 2009</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/alexander-michelle/">Michelle Alexander 2012</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/camp-jordan-t/">Camp and Heatherton 2016</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/duvernay-ava-dir/">DuVernay 2016</a>). By a sleight of hand, historically situated and systemic state-­driven racial dynamics are erased, dynamics in play since enslavement through colonialism through Jim Crow and apartheid systems to this day. What is more, whether race-­making nation-­states and those who are ensnared in their orbit are race conscious with a long-­standing history of deploying racial categories, as in Canada, the U.S., or the United Kingdom, or race blind in that states reject or retreat from a concept of race and thereby ban racial categories, the social outcomes are the same. Racial inequality and racial violence abound because race, even when unnamed or misrecognized, continues to play a critical role in how those societies are organized and how people are accordingly mis/treated. To take, however, the position that those who bore the stigmata of race exercised no agency is not only to err but also to adopt the perspective of a racist. Oft-­overlooked everyday forms of resistance and revolts were central to race rebellions that make legible and visible civil rights battles waged on the ground (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/kelley-robin-d-se/">Kelley 1994</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/kendi-ibram-x-se/">Kendi 2016</a>).</p>
<p>What, then, is race? Paradoxically, race is everything and nothing at the same time but ultimately whatever a society has made it to mean. One thing is certain, as the theorist Hortense Spillers (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/spillers-hortense-j-se/">2003, 378</a>) writes, race, “unnatural and preponderant in its grotesque mandates,” has no scientific basis. Yet, through its protean registers, race is always insisting violently that a racialized world is a natural one, the way it was meant to be. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Religion” has been used within African American studies to identify the sacred rituals, symbols, traditions, and worldviews to which black folks adhere and to distinguish them from the ordinary, informal, and nonsacred principles that structure black life. Inherent in the etymology of “religion” and its subsequent genealogy is its connection to formal, identifiable traditions. The word “religion” immediately invokes an organized system on which sacred beliefs are placed and subsequent behaviors are enacted. Within African American studies, this includes, most prominently, Christianity and, less popularly, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, African traditional religions (ATRs) such as Yoruba, Santería, and Candomblé, and African-­derived religions (ADRs) and folk traditions such as voodoo, conjure, and hoodoo.</p>
<p>It is impossible to understate the conceptual significance of religion—­the effervescent, ethereal, and expressive faiths—­to the experiences of African Americans. After all, whether called “African American religion” or, as interchangeably deployed here, “black religion,” the psychic, soulful expressions of black folks have influenced key moments of American history. The experience of the Middle Passage cultivated burgeoning spiritual identities and practices for blacks in America (and in the black Atlantic world), shaped by the trauma of forced bondage, honed by the demands of the plantocracy, and refined beyond institutional enslavement. Hush harbors housed the sacred diasporic cosmologies that were transported during the transatlantic slave trade and morphed into the unique expressions of spirituality exemplified in the emergence of Negro spirituals. The features of black religious expression that emerged in those clandestine spaces of “slave religion” have yet to be fully uncovered (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/raboteau-albert-j/">Raboteau 1978</a>). They are the foundations of what has become <em>African American</em> religion.</p>
<p>Central to the civil rights movement, for example, were the music and sounds—­including the call-­and-­response style—­that emerged from the hush harbors of North America. Black religious groups and organizations aided black Americans through tumultuous eras—­abolitionism, Reconstruction, and Jim Crow among them—­and helped usher in the broadest institutional and legal applications of equality for African Americans. Some of the most <em>visible</em> figures within African American history—­Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Jarena Lee, Maria Stewart, “Gullah” Jack Pritchard, Septima Clark, Clara Muhammad, Marcus Garvey, Nat Turner, Fannie Lou Hamer, and others—­emerged from black churches, temples, mosques, and spiritual movements. Even as the “great leader” model is not the most effective or accurate means of understanding black religious, political, social, historical, and cultural change (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/edwards-erica-r/">E. Edwards 2012</a>), it is notable that there is no single space, sole tradition, or particular locale that produced these leaders.</p>
<p>This is a fairly straightforward conceptual framing of religion, and yet, as it is common to black experience and black expression, this claim to meaning is not without its irony. At the root of the connotation of “religion” in its Latin (<em>religare</em>) and Old French (<em>religio</em>) origins is the assumption of bondage, where one binds oneself to—­or is bound by—­a sense of obligation, intimacy (i.e., bond), or reverence to a holy other. Considering those faiths that the enslaved held onto during the Middle Passage, then, gives us a new way of interpreting the meaning of a double bind, for as they were being subjugated, they wrestled with holding onto the beliefs that would allow their survival. This active wrestling between bond and bondage, agency and submission, is too an instrumental part of African American religion and has resulted in a shift of how the term “religion” has been used over time. Put another way, the keyword “religion” reflects the intimate struggles that black folks face as they strive to loosen the strongholds of imposed bondage while acquiescing to the agency inherent in choosing their own gods. Hence, various idioms including “faith,” “belief,” and most recently, “spirituality,” have been appropriated in place of the religion. Yet they largely convey the same thing, even as the terms all point toward the idea that what black folk believe in is no longer exclusively or predominantly tied to formal traditions or practices. Rather, these concepts all tap into a sacred undercurrent, so to speak—­of how African Americans structure their lives and actions around what they deem holy, irrefutable, and sacred. In essence, “religion” for African Americans has always been, as William D. Hart describes, “a conceptual tool, a historically and discursively informed way of categorizing a heterogeneous ensemble of cultural practices in the Black Atlantic world” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/hart-william-d/">2006, 476</a>).</p>
<p>Mapping the contoured meanings of religion for blacks in the United States thus poses a distinct challenge, as one result of enslavement was an active dismantling of ATRs, ADRs, and folk religion. Christianity, a religion of “the masters,” took its own roots in black life, which resulted in a perception of its becoming synonymous with black religion. From the earliest iterations, literature on black religion has been focused on its Protestant, Christian expressions. One need only turn to the famed sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois’s 1903 articulation of African American religion in <em>The Souls of Black Folks</em> or, a century later, the incomparable sociological work presented by C. Eric Lincoln and Lawrence Mamiya (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/lincoln-c-2/">1990</a>) to see how the creation of seven mainline Protestant denominations between the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries left a remarkable impression on the formation of black religion in America. It was within these denominations that the largest numbers of enslaved, formerly enslaved, and free blacks publicly participated and that documented accounts of African American religious expression were most readily made.</p>
<p>Even as history has revealed that the complexities of black religiosity are not—­and have never been—­<em>just</em> Christian, the impact of Christianity on African American religion is quite significant. The visibility, centrality, and predominance of black Protestantism within historical presentations have resulted in the treatment of black religion as synonymous with the formation of the black (Christian) church. This move, which William Hart (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/hart-william-d-se/">2008</a>) calls the “Standard Narrative of Black Religion as the Black Church,” has diminished the robust and dynamic features of black religion that do not fall within the confines of Christianity. Hart has provided a more comprehensive way of thinking about the “Three Rival Narratives of Black Religion” that disrupt popular reductions of black religion to the black church. To Hart, black religion is as much the typical notion of the black (Protestant, Christian) church as it is the “souls of black folks,” or an existential phenomenology shaped by racial identity and the condition of antiblack racism. Black religion, to Hart, is also <em>relegare</em>, meaning “ancestor piety,” in which one celebrates the names of <em>all</em> ancestors, including those “who invoke the gods of Africa, . . . who invoke other gods, . . . who invoke no gods at all, who are indifferent to the gods, or curse the gods” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/hart-william-d/">2006, 490</a>).</p>
<p>Hart’s inclusive treatment of black religion in America should not be viewed as a counternarrative. Historically, the Christianizing thread is in fact disingenuous to the origins of black religion in America. When one examines the earliest iterations of what has become African American religion, it is evident that blacks spent nearly two centuries on the shores of North America before Christianity took root. Instrumental, then, to any understanding of black religion is the notion of religious syncretism, the merging of distinct (or conflicting) practices, rituals, and traditions into a single system of belief. Inherent to the idea of religious syncretism is the fusing of multiple religions. African American religion is, at its core, the blending of traditions created from practices, rituals, and cosmologies that originate from places throughout the black Atlantic. Inherently, then, the plurality of African American religions has necessitated multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches to their examination.</p>
<p>A small number of early works on black religion disrupted the Christocentric narrative of black religion, including especially Arthur Fauset’s <em>Black Gods of the Metropolis</em> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/fauset-arthur/">(1944)</a> and Lincoln’s <em>The Black Muslims in America</em> (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/lincoln-c/">1961</a>). In the tradition of those forebears, contemporary scholarship in the field has increasingly (and rightly) moved further away from the overwhelmingly Christocentric focus that has dominated popular notions of black religiosity and has focused more readily on the syncretic aspects of African American religion. Works such as Yvonne Chireau’s <em>Black Magic: Religion and the African American Conjuring Tradition</em> (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/chireau-yvonne/">2006</a>); Tracey Hucks’s <em>Yoruba Traditions and African American Religion Nationalism</em> (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/hucks-tracey-e/">2012</a>); Jacob Dorman’s <em>Chosen People: The Rise of American Black Israelite Religions</em> (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/dorman-jacob-s/">2013</a>); Manigault-­Bryant’s <em>Talking to the Dead: Religion, Music, and Lived Memory among Gullah/Geechee Women</em> (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/manigault-bryant-lerhonda-s/">2014</a>), and Eddie Glaude’s <em>African American Religion: A Very Short Introduction</em> (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/glaude-eddie-s-se/">2014</a>) are indicative of this shift. Judith Weisenfeld’s (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/weisenfeld-judith/">2017</a>) recent exploration of religio-­racial formation among black participants in the Moorish Science Temple, the Nation of Islam, Father Divine’s Peace Mission Movement, and Ethiopian Hebrew sects takes the fluid intersections of religion and race as the framing traditions for which to consider and imagine the vast diversity of black religious expression in the United States. As a collective, these works suggest that any routine reflection on black religion must begin with the knowledge that African American religion is as diverse in its expression as it is vast in its appropriation.</p>
<p>The increase of more syncretic approaches to understanding African American religion is not the only development that has altered our understanding of black religion. A more explicit focus on gender has also expanded notions of black religion beyond places where men are the preeminent religious participants and authorities. Admittedly, this is a shift in the scope of African American religion that has taken unnecessarily long to unfold. Critical analyses of black women’s roles within (Christian) sacred spaces were led by the deployment of Alice Walker’s (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/walker-alice-se/">1983</a>) terminology into the establishment of womanist theology. Jacquelyn Grant, for example, was particularly critical of the invisibility of black women within black theology in her landmark essay “Black Theology and the Black Woman” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/grant-jacquelyn/">1979</a>) and subsequent text <em>White Women’s Christ and Black Women’s Jesus: Feminist Christology and Womanist Response</em> (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/grant-jacquelyn-se/">1989</a>). This intervention, along with Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham’s (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/higginbotham-evelyn-brooks/">1993</a>) extensive historical work on black women’s activism within the Baptist church, led to an extensive scholarly collection on black women’s religious histories that harks back to the powerful narrative of the African Methodist Episcopal church’s first female preacher, Jarena Lee (b. 1783), and has continued into the present. Notably, however, black women’s stories are still largely framed within the context of Christianity. Modern communities of black folks are increasingly turning away from formalized religion. Similarly, female members of the faith (who continue to hold the largest membership within black churches) ruminate aloud, as Eddie Glaude Jr. (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/glaude-eddie-s/">2010</a>) did in his (hotly contested) public obituary, whether “the black church is dead.” This suggests that engendered exposés of the confines of black religion and the question of the efficacy of Christianity for black women will continue to be a point of critical reflection.</p>
<p>Another important development within African American religion has been an increased focus on the black body and sexuality. This too is a more recent shift within the field, demarcated by the work of Kelly Brown Douglas (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/douglas-kelly-brown/">1999</a>), Horace L. Griffin (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/griffin-horace-l/">2006</a>), Ashon T. Crawley (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/crawley-ashon-t/">2008</a>), and Roger Sneed (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/sneed-roger-a/">2010</a>). The limited focus on the black religious body and its engendered and sexualized manifestations is particularly intriguing considering the role that black corporeality played upon the arrival of blacks in North America. Moreover, the placement of black bodies at the lowest rung of the global racial-­hierarchical ladder has meant that within religion, sacred corporeality has given way to diminishing misperceptions of the black body as deviant and hypersexual. These silences around the black body and black sexuality within religion are diminishing as increased focus on how the body facilitates communication and encounter with the sacred continues to complicate any perceived “normativity” within black religious expression.</p>
<p>These modern shifts in the field come from a long-­standing practice of critiquing the cultural implications of black religion, laid bare in the prolific, scathing critique of black Pentecostalism in James Baldwin’s classic text <em>Go Tell It on the Mountain</em> (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/baldwin-james/">1953</a>) and in the less publicized folk practices made infamous by the inimitable griot Zora Neale Hurston in <em>The Sanctified Church</em> (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/hurston-zora-neale-se-6/">1981</a>) and <em>Tell My Horse: Voodoo Life in Haiti and Jamaica</em> (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/hurston-zora-neale-se-7/">1990</a>). Black women and gay-­, lesbian-­, queer-­, and transgender-­identified bodies have radically altered our perceptions of the spaces in which black sacred altars are erected. The emergence of womanism and queer and sexuality studies have simultaneously transformed what we now know or think of as African American religion.</p>
<p>To fully understand the connotation of religion within African American studies, then, is not to explore the <em>what</em> or <em>who</em> of black religion but to revel in the <em>why</em>. Even as it is important to understand <em>what</em> African Americans believe and <em>who</em> has contributed to that understanding, knowledge of which religious traditions black folks adhere to and whether they are Christian, Jewish, African, nationalistic, folk, and so on is less meaningful to religion’s place as a keyword. Rather, it is more consequential to comprehend <em>why</em> religion matters in the most rudimentary sense, which is expressly connected to the wrestling between narratives of bondage and narratives of freedom and the black believing bodies that struggle with the agency of choice in a world that frequently deems it as “other.”</p>
<p>African American religion has always been shaped by its people, geographies, and contexts. In the mid-­nineteenth century, the spiritual desires of black people demanded the creation and cultivation of their own spaces, which became black churches, mosques, temples, and sacred sanctuaries. This current moment is no different, and the emergence of the #BlackLivesMatter movement is a modern example of the dialectical interplay between American political and social environments and black religion. The movement formally began in 2012, in response to the controversial, racially polarizing case in Sanford, Florida, where George Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager. The outcry and protest surrounding Martin’s death and Zimmerman’s subsequent acquittal certainly stand in the black activist tradition of Ida B. Wells and are reminiscent of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) of the 1960s. What distinguishes the #BlackLivesMatter movement from others is the current context in which it has emerged. Social media, digital technologies, and hashtag activism have immediately placed it within a global, diasporic conversation. That one of the founders and leaders of the movement—­Patrisse Cullors—­is the embodiment of black religious syncretism as a self-­identified queer polyamorous practitioner of the Yoruban divination tradition called Ifá further differentiates this moment and this movement from its historical antecedents (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/farrag-hebah-h/">Farrag 2015</a>).</p>
<p>#BlackLivesMatter exemplifies the permeability of the term “religion” within African American studies to mean more than just formal tradition or adherence to a neatly outlined system of belief. Even as it is designated as a “political movement,” its sacred undercurrents are palpable via its leadership and its calls for black agency and the removal of the contemporary forms of political, structural, and social bondage that threaten to deem black lives irrelevant. The #BlackLivesMatter movement reminds us that the killing of unarmed black bodies is not exceptional or unique. Rather, the movement confirms more names to be added to a disturbing litany of lynchings, murders, and deaths of black women, men, and children, including Jordan Davis, Eric Garner, Rekia Boyd, Yvette Smith, Tamir Rice, Michelle Vash Payne, Sam DuBose, Aiyana Jones, the Charleston Nine, and Sandra Bland. #BlackLivesMatter further affirms that the spilling of black blood on American soil is more normative than not, and black religion has always had to grapple with—­and respond to—­that reality.<em> This is the why.</em> Even when black religious organizations have not formally responded to these deaths, it is within sacred spaces that the grieving families and loved ones are comforted, that communities are rallied to action, and that the bodies of the dead are ceremoniously laid to rest. Black religion, in all of its variants, contours, traditions, cosmologies, and histories, forces us to grapple with what it means to believe in <em>anything</em> within a country that frequently leaves its black citizens questioning the meaning of their lives.</p>
<p>Black religion is as much the heart-­wrenching angst communicated in the Negro spiritual “Nobody Knows the Trouble I See” as it is the visual representation of the <em>Baptism of Sue Mae</em> by the South Carolinian artist Jonathan Green (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/green-jonathan/">1986</a>). Black religion is as much the sacred significance communicated in hip-­hop culture (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/miller-monica-r/">Miller and Pinn 2014</a>) as it is the creation of a protest sign by Daniel José Camacho (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/camacho-daniel-jose/">2015</a>), influenced by black liberation theology and resulting in the trending hashtag #JamesConeWasRight. Black religion is deeply historical yet simultaneously influenced by its current contexts. Black religion is Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Pan-­Africanism, agnosticism, atheism, humanism, conjure, folklore, call-­and-­response, musical, oral, aural, visual, activism, protest, soul, death, life, and eternity. To acknowledge the significance of black religion means that one accepts that there has always been an active wrestling with the meaning of religion in black life and that experiences of spirituality, faith, and ritualized expression among African Americans are as diverse, broad, and purposeful in their scope as they are in their function. Taking religion seriously means recognizing that any consideration of social identities, social movements, history, and cultural production that has impacted African Americans likely has had black religiosity or spirituality at its core. In sum, the complexities of African American religion and spirituality are as vast and diverse as are the millions of black folks who contribute to its formation—­past, present, and future.</p>

In its most common understanding, sexuality is the quality of being sexual or possessing sex; it is understood as what one does in terms of sex acts and practices and who one is, often (inadequately) defined as heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/burgett-bruce/">Burgett 2007</a>).

Sexuality has also been used to denote sex assignment or male-­versus-­female differences, largely on the basis of genital and secondary sex characteristics and reproductive functions. It is a concept that has been applicable to the social organization and formation of human and nonhumans alike.</p>
<p>In a December <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/patton-stacey/">2012</a> essay in the <em>Chronicle Review</em> of the <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em>, titled “Who’s Afraid of Black Sexuality?,” the writer Stacey Patton suggests that for a long time, scholars, including black scholars, have avoided mentioning the word “sex,” let alone discussing it openly. Patton goes on to say that black sex was particularly fraught because it invoked too many taboos: stereotypes and caricatures of “black Hottentots” with freakish feminine proportions; asexual mammies or lascivious Jezebels; and hypersexual black men lusting after white women. This has been compounded by the painful history of slavery, rape, and lynching and the panoply of ways in which black bodies have been subjected to and victimized by brutal forms of sexual violence and abuse by both state and nonstate actors in the U.S. Further, Patton explains in her essay that, conversely, in recent years, some black scholars from a number of disciplines have begun to “break the silence” and conspicuously engage issues around sexuality confronting black communities. This engagement is not just focused on the violence, oppression, and trauma; rather, these scholars examine and highlight eroticism, sexual desire, pleasure, and practice, including nonnormative sexual subjects and community formations. A summit on doctoral programs held at Northwestern University in 2012, titled “A Beautiful Struggle: Transformative Black Studies in Shifting Political Landscapes,” inspired Patton’s essay. This event sparked a spirited discussion about sexuality studies that marks a pivotal turn in the contemporary discourse on sexuality in the field of African American studies and black communities.</p>
<p>The etymology of “sexuality” is derived from the postclassical Latin <em>sexualitas</em>. But the etymology reveals nothing of the history of sexuality, which appears to be just as discursively homogeneous as its linguistic foundations. As documented by the French theorist Michel Foucault’s (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/foucault-michel-se/">1978</a>) three-­volume treatise on the history of sexuality, sexuality has been constructed by various institutions over the past two centuries: medical and scientific, judicial, religious, military, and economic. One of the most fecund aspects of Foucault’s work is his contention that sexuality is produced out of discourse whereby sexual acts become associated with actual human beings. Hence, the “sodomite” becoming the “homosexual” is a modern phenomenon (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/foucault-michel-se/">Foucault 1978</a>). But, while Foucault also highlights the double impetus of power and pleasure embedded in Western constructs of sexuality, the genealogies he relies on are derived from Western regimes of knowledge. For black people, however, the formation of sexuality does not rest solely on a foundation of Greco/Roman/European histories of sexuality, the “objectivity” of the sciences, or Christian dogma. African Americans may have assimilated into such histories, but when resistance to a universal experience of sexuality has been waged, black people relied on the culture, language, and representations produced in their own communities to correct the gaps and errors produced by <em>a</em> history of sexuality. According to the ever-­changing B.E.D. (Black English Dictionary), there are multiple terms that connote sexuality, all of them heterogeneous and requiring more context rather than a linear symmetrical history.</p>
<p>In addition, research on sexuality has compelled African American studies to redefine and expand its premise as an intellectual field foundationally situated as a linear, unilateral project based on the biological and sociological constructs of race and racialization. In many ways, African American studies remains somewhat ambivalent about sexuality, specifically because the discourses surrounding it cannot be separated from colonial and imperialist legacies. And although African Americans live at the intersections of race, class, and sexuality, ironically, scholarship on black sexuality in African American studies has developed on two contentious and disparate terrains that intend to define, control, and represent discourses on black sexuality in the field and in black culture and politics. Drawing from black feminist and queer theories, some sexuality scholars examine the historical forms of racialized sexual oppression of black people and how black sexual minorities are oppressed within and excluded from black sociocultural institutions. Yet this productive scholarship on sexuality has been suppressed and marginalized in African American studies due, in part, to an overcompensatory response to racist/white-­supremacist renderings of black people as sexually deviant. Too often, on this side of the epistemological struggle, an essentialist, race-­based, cisgendered, and heterosexist discourse of black sexuality dominates.</p>
<p>However, with the black political scientist Cathy J. Cohen’s (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/cohen-cathy-j-se/">2004</a>) notion of “deviance as resistance,” it seems that the most generative scholarship on black sexuality that is also critical and contextual has been produced by and from studies of minoritized communities and cultures: those black sexual dissidents who are oppressed within or excluded from black communities. Through their ongoing contestation, the work of these mostly black queer scholars constitutes Foucault’s notion of an “insurrection of subjugated knowledges” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/foucault-michel-se-2/">1980, 81</a>) in African American studies that uncovers deviant sexual practices and advances an expansive approach to studying black sexuality within its already-­situated contexts of race, gender, and class. It is this movement in black sexuality studies—­in academic, cultural, and sociopolitical realms—­that is most productive and promising toward understanding and capturing the meaning and role of sex and sexuality in the lives of everyday black people.</p>
<p>Historically, from the very beginning of Western Manifest Destiny, sexuality determined one’s moral foundation, while morality determined one’s humanity. Thus, any analysis of sexuality in African American studies must begin with a discussion of freedom and liberation. For better or worse, sexuality in African American studies has consistently been used to determine the depth and nature of black ontologies. It is, like race, a measure of how one’s humanity is defined. Concepts of self-­determination within the Black Power movement might be heralded as the significant intervention for rethinking black sexuality, moving away from white theories of hypersexual pathology, trauma, and abuse. Robert Staples’s (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/staples-robert/">1971</a>) and Alvin Poussaint’s (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/phil-donahue-show/"><em>Phil Donahue Show</em> 1980</a>) early social science work was quite simply about challenging these pathologies. For example, the pioneering sociologist Staples once asked a significant question about sexuality and black America in a 1974 issue of <em>Ebony</em> magazine, one that still haunts black people across the globe today: Has the sexual revolution bypassed blacks? Staples may have been comparing the lack of a visible civil rights movement centered on sexuality or sexual identity to white America’s historical sexual revolution, but the truth is more complicated since sexuality, including the study of it, entails a revolution, rebellion, and decolonization that would be illegible in white histories of sexuality and sexual revolution. Since black people across the globe continue to live under white supremacy, African Americans’ sexual revolution is an ongoing process that does not begin or end with the 1960s. However, what does happen in the late 1960s is a stream of thought that invokes debate about eroticism and sexuality in discourses other than science, medicine, and history.</p>
<p>Unlike any other keyword, “sexuality” demands both rational and affective modalities to circumvent the imperatives imposed by Western empire. The poet and playwright Ntozake Shange asks, “So how do we speak of our desires for each other to each other in a language where our relationships to our bodies and desires lack dignity as well as nuance?” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/shange-ntozake-se/">1992, xx</a>). Shange’s question eloquently sums up sexuality, its conflicts, its possibilities, and its origins in African American studies. It also implicates art and culture as important to evolving discourses on black sexuality.</p>
<p>In African American communities, the genealogy of sexuality has been theorized and engaged through the critical/rational as well as the imaginative and affective. This has meant that the most generative sites for understanding sexuality have come from black feminist theories and African American literary traditions. In each of these sites, the topics of slavery, colonialism, and imperialism have been deliberately taken up as essential to sexuality, and they have done so in a manner that sexology and Eurocentric theories of sexuality have not commented on.</p>
<p>As the remnants of chattel slavery, scientific racism, and eugenics continued to impact African American life, sexuality continued to be an issue, especially in novels by nineteenth-­century black women writers, such as Frances Ellen Watkins Harper in <em>Iola Leroy, or, Shadows Uplifted</em> ([<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/harper-frances-ellen-watkins/">1892] 1988</a>), Pauline Hopkins in <em>Contending Forces</em> ([<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/hopkins-pauline-e/">1899] 1969</a>), and Harriet Jacobs in <em>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</em> ([<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/jacobs-harriet-a/">1861] 1988</a>). By fictionalizing sexual topics such as chaste and virginal womanhood, rape, miscegenation, and passing, these texts, alongside conduct manuals written by black ministers and preachers, captured the unaired tensions surrounding the sexual trauma of black women during chattel slavery and white anxiety about black masculinity and hypersexuality in freedom. Male writers such as W. E. B. Du Bois (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/du-bois-w-se-6/">1920</a>) contributed other theories, resulting in an early archive of black culture and history linking sexual inquiries with a moral agenda to rescue black women’s virtue from the clutches of white men and black men’s masculinity from white ideologies of deviance.</p>
<p>Later, Richard Wright’s <em>Native Son</em> (1940), Ralph Ellison’s <em>Invisible Man</em> ([<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/ellison-ralph/">1947] 1995</a>), John A. Williams’s <em>The Man Who Cried I Am</em> (1967), Toni Morrison’s <em>The Bluest Eye</em> (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/morrison-toni/">[1970] 2007</a>), and Gayl Jones’s<em> Corregidora</em> ([<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/jones-gayl/">1975] 1986</a>) and <em>Eva’s Man</em> ([<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/jones-gayl-se/">1976] 1987</a>) provided daring perspectives on race and gender, observing sexuality as a distinct category that could shift critical conversations about race and black humanity. James Baldwin’s <em>Giovanni’s Room</em> ([<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/baldwin-james-se/">1956] 2001</a>) and <em>Another Country</em> ([<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/baldwin-james-se-2/">1962] 1993</a>) eventually broached questions of sexual identity to move beyond concerns about proper heterosexuality and productive black families. The 1970s ushered in a new era of critical inquiries and excavation of black sexuality in which critics read not only for race but for gender and sexuality as well. It is no coincidence that the recovery of out-­of-­print nineteenth-­century slave narratives and novels coincided with the Black Women Writers Renaissance and the women’s representations of sexuality in their work. Likewise, the social and political discourse of an emasculating matriarch, fueled, in part, by the Moynihan Report (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/moynihan-daniel-p/">1965</a>), bolstered more work on black sexuality from Robert Staples, who authored <em>The Black Woman in America: Sex, Marriage, Family</em> (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/staples-robert-se/">1973</a>). This book, as well as others, built on the critical tradition left by Du Bois’s early questions that linked black liberation with black women’s bodies. In this way, it became impossible for any critical analysis to separate gender from sexuality in studies of black sexuality.</p>
<p>Such was the case with the recovery of black women’s literary traditions, which sought to correct and collectively engage the discourses of black sexual pathology. During the 1980s, critics such as Hazel Carby (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/carby-hazel-v/">1987</a>), Barbara Christian (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/christian-barbara/">1980</a>), Darlene Clark Hine (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/hine-darlene-clark-se/">1989</a>), and Sander Gilman (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/gilman-sander-l/">1985</a>) provided necessary interventions into African American studies by creating a field of inquiry around representation of black women’s sexuality. At the same time, the theories of someone such as Hortense Spillers (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/spillers-hortense-j/">1987</a>) invoked a diasporic and gender-­neutral subject out of African American literary representations of sexuality, such as in Ralph Ellison’s <em>Invisible Man</em>. Audre Lorde (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/lorde-audre/">1984</a>) revised notions of eroticism, elevated sexual difference, and prioritized black feminism. Likewise, Cheryl Clarke began theorizing the failure of a black political sphere to transform its homophobic stance, saying of twentieth-­century black politics, “We have expended much energy trying to debunk the racist mythology which says our sexuality is depraved. Unfortunately, many of us have overcompensated and assimilated to the Puritan value that sex is for procreation, occurs only between men and women, and is only valid within the confines of heterosexual marriage” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/clarke-cheryl/">1983, 192</a>). Clarke’s words were necessary because just as African American studies was moving from a political and activist endeavor to an intellectual enterprise, productive examinations of sexuality were being stymied by conservative gender politics.</p>
<p>Analyses of sexuality in African American studies were also spurred on by the emergence of Afrocentric thought on sexuality. Molefi Asante (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/asante-molefi-kete/">1980</a>) and Frances Cress Welsing (1991) put forth essentialist arguments on African sexuality, suggesting that all nonheterosexual forms of sexuality were European cultural importations. Each posited that such categories were themselves the result of white supremacy and terrorism. Major lines of inquiry no longer simply asked whether black people were virtuous and chaste enough to obtain and retain citizenship but whether black hyperheterosexuality and homosexuality were a result of white terror during slavery and Jim Crow. However, anthropologists and historians of the African diaspora, such as James Sweet (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/sweet-james-h/">1996</a>), Lorand Matory (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/matory-james-lorand/">2005</a>), and Gloria Wekker (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/wekker-gloria/">2006</a>), provided compelling arguments that alternative sexualities, including homosexuality, have always existed in African cultures, both traditional and modern. Diverse sexualities in Africa predate colonization.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the twenty-­first century, black queer studies began to broaden perspectives beyond cisgender heterosexuality and to provide alternative analyses of black sexuality. For example, the “Black Queer Studies in New Millennium” conference (2000) and the collection based on the conference proceedings, <em>Black Queer Studies</em> (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/johnson-e-2/">Johnson and Henderson 2005</a>), ushered in significant interventions in African American studies by emphasizing black queer cultural formations and the queer of color scholars who study them. In what the critics Jennifer Devere Brody and Dwight McBride (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/brody-jennifer-devere-and-dwight-a/">2000</a>) metaphorically denote as “plum nelly,” black queer studies located itself in between two fields, queer studies and African American studies, so as to begin the transdisciplinary critique of plumbing or questioning African American studies’ avoidance of sexuality and queer studies’ avoidance of race. In the questioning of sexuality, queer of color critique insists that African American studies be a site to deconstruct previous sexuality studies and queer theories that make no mention of race and ethnicity. Both African American studies and queer studies changed the questions being asked and the objects of study to answer the questions. Rather than relying on religion and biological sciences, African American studies began to generate theories beyond deracinated histories and discourses of sexuality, specifically interrogating concepts of racialized sexuality.</p>
<p>For example, Abdul Jan Mohammed (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/mohammed-abdul-jan/">1992</a>) develops a theory of racialized sexuality through an analysis of the fictive discourses of Richard Wright. Siobhan Somerville (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/somerville-siobhan-b/">2000</a>) also uses African American literature and culture to “queer the colorline.” The cultural theorist Roderick Ferguson uses canonical texts in African American literature to critique sociological examinations of black sexuality to create his queer of color critique, stating, “The specific history of African Americans’ constitution as the objects of racial and sexual knowledge through canonical sociology has produced modes of deployment that cohere with and diverge from those outlined by Foucault” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/ferguson-roderick/">2004, 72</a>). Elsewhere, Ferguson warns us not to ask, “How can we make sexuality the <em>object</em> of African American studies”; instead, we should ask, “In what ways has the racialized, classed, and gendered discourse known as sexuality dispersed itself to constitute this particular discipline or interdiscipline?” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/ferguson-roderick-se/">2005, 87</a>). In the majority of his work, Ferguson notes that sexuality is the critical product of interventions made by women of color feminisms. Nevertheless, as debates about black lesbianism and sex wars demonstrated, women of color feminism had inadvertently erected barriers about proper objects and subjects that queer theory would push against.</p>
<p>Despite the work done by many scholars within black queer studies, too much of African American studies still views sexuality as a minor concern: racial identity and solidarity politics take precedent over sexual identity politics. Therefore, in the first quarter of the twenty-­first century, radical studies of sexuality have necessarily become about further resistance to legacies of morality and respectability politics. These strategies entail using improper objects of study to intervene in both queer studies and African American studies. Picking up from where feminists such as Cheryl Clarke left off in her criticism of African American political agendas, Cathy Cohen has consistently advised African American studies to sharpen its knowledge and politics around improper objects and deviance to avoid the fallacy of previous generations. More specifically, Cohen suggests that the repetition of deviant practices by multiple individuals and the creation of new identities and communities can lead to an emerging politics of deviance as resistance (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/cohen-cathy-j-se/">2004, 27</a>). In addition to Cohen’s ideas about deviance, Robert Reid-­Pharr has also contested queer theory’s and queer studies’ conservative editorial mandates of language, stating that he has “continued . . . to be amazed by the implication that, even though utilizing a queer apparatus implied a commitment to bringing new topics into polite academic discourse, it did not obligate one to call into question the necessity of the polite, civil, gentlemanly nature of that discourse” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/works_cited/reid-pharr-robert/">2001, 101</a>). Here Reid-­Pharr highlights both the possibilities and limits of black queer theoretical and sociopolitical interventions.</p>
<p>Yet, as noted earlier, often marginalized people and communities and the transgressive practices that they undertake provide a useful perspective for defining and redefining sexuality in general and black sexuality in particular, so as to push beyond the confines of academic discourse. As contemporary scholars refuse to ignore the lives and culture of nontraditional families, sex workers, transgender artists and activists, and queer folk alike, they remind us that black sexuality is lived, just as it is examined and talked about. An ongoing critical dialogic relationship is required, particularly during these times when the stakes are high in the struggle over black sexual knowledge and when the sexual domain continues to be a means through which epistemological, and literal, violence, oppression, and exclusion are inflicted on black people. Likewise, however, this meditation of the keyword and the discursive terrain out of which it emerges highlights the potential for sexuality to be a space of freedom to explore and experience agency and pleasure and to achieve at least a modicum of autonomy and bliss.</p>
