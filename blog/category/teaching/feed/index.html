				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three faculty members at the University of Iowa – Naomi Greyser, Aniruddha Dutta, and Aimee Carrillo Rowe – have kindly <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/in-the-classroom/syllabi-and-assignments/diversity-and-power-gender-race-and-class-in-the-united-states/">shared a keywords assignment</a> that was part of their course on “Diversity and Power: Gender, Race, and Class in the United States.” They offer it as an instance of what can be done with <em>Keywords for American Cultural Studies</em> in an undergraduate course, and we’re very happy to be able to pass it along to you.</p>
<p>The assignment is different from <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/in-the-classroom/syllabi-and-assignments/">others on the site</a>. It asks students to write a short autoethnography in which they share reflections on how their everyday lives are shaped by a term from <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/"><em>Keywords</em></a>. It also invites them to address their keyword’s intersection with additional categories of identity and experience such as sexuality, religion, citizenship, and age.</p>
<p>The course – offered through the Gender, Women’s, and Sexuality Studies program – fulfills the diversity requirement in the General Education program at the University of Iowa. It introduces students to intersectional, transnational, and ecological approaches to identity, experience, and American-ness. Students learn about histories and topographies of injustice, focusing on social movements and everyday practices that resistance that injustice.</p>
<p>The keywords that organize the course include <a title="Diversity" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/diversity/">diversity</a>, <a title="Slavery" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/slavery/">slavery</a>, <a title="Race" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/race/">race</a>, <a title="Racialization" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/racialization/">racialization</a>, <a title="Ethnicity" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/ethnicity/">ethnicity</a>, <a title="Class" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/class/">class</a>, <a title="Labor" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/labor/">labor</a>, <a title="Gender" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/gender/">gender</a>, <a title="Disability" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/disability/">disability</a>, <a title="Indigenous" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/indigenous/">indigenous</a>, <a title="Indian" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/indian/">Indian</a>, <a title="Capitalism" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/capitalism/">capitalism</a>, <a title="Nation" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/nation/">nation</a>, <a title="Empire" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/empire/">empire</a>, <a title="Globalization" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/globalization/">globalization</a>, <a title="Religion" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/religion/">religion</a>, <a title="Queer" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/queer/">queer</a>, and <a title="Politics" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/politics/">politics</a>.</p>
<p>We thank Naomi, Anirhudda, and Aimee for their willingness to share their assignment, and for finding new and generative ways to use <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/"><em>Keywords for American Cultural Studies</em></a> in the classroom. If you use their idea – or come up with another one – we want to hear about it! Drop us a line at <a href="mailto:keywords@fordham.edu">keywords@fordham.edu</a>, and include a description of the course and your assignment, along with a note about what worked and what needs work.</p>

<p>We came away from the conference even more excited by conversations we had about the volume with lots of folks, including the editors of the other keyword books coming out from NYU Press in the near future.  Many of those conversations focused on the uses that individuals have made of the first edition in courses and/or the additional keywords they were interested in working on or reading, including terms such as “safety” and “gesture.”</p>
<p>We want to repeat here what we said to many at the conference.  We are very interested in two forms of post-publication response to the print/digital volume.</p>
<p>1)  Please send us syllabi and/or assignments that have used <em>Keywords for American Cultural Studies</em>.  We are committed to building a rich and useable archive on the site under “<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/in-the-classroom/syllabi-and-assignments/">Syllabi and Assignments.</a>”  All we need is the syllabus or assignment, along with a couple of lines about the course context, the shape of the project, and what worked and what needs work.  These courses and assignments do NOT need to have used the Keywords <a href="http://keywords.fordhamitac.org/wiki2/index.php?title=Welcome_to_the_Keywords_Collaboratory">Collaboratory</a> or other digital platforms to be useful.</p>
<p>2)  Please send an email <a href="mailto:keywords@fordham.edu">keywords@fordham.edu</a> if you are interested in authoring a post-publication essay that responds or adds to what is already in print and online.  These essays will be reviewed by us and published on the site where they will be searchable along with all of the other print and digital essays.  They can be all text or fully multi-modal.</p>
<p>We will be able to publicize any and all new contributions through the site, this blog, and other social media.  Looking forward to hearing from you about how you are using and responding to Keywords.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to announce the release of the newest edition of the <i>Keywords</i> series: <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/"><i>Keywords for African American Studies</i></a>. Our efforts, as co-editors, centered on reaching out to specialists across scholarly disciplines who can describe, with authority and clarity, the fundamental meanings and utilities of words that are essential to the discourse and exploration of African American Studies. An inherently interdisciplinary venture, this project employs a language that transcends the disciplinary prose of any one area of study. Historians, sociologists, literary scholars, political scientists, and other enrich this publication. Each essay adds broader understanding of the field of what is alternatively known as Africana Studies or Black Studies.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>As the most recent iteration of the NYU Press <i>Keywords</i> series, the book builds upon the tradition of providing a critical source for engaging and understanding a wide range of terms and concepts that circulate in a field of study. Not only are these words defined, but they are discussed within a context of their utility among scholars of that subject. Here, the reader is guided through the corpus of scholarship and made aware of how keywords operate therein.   <u></u><u></u></p>
<p>The title is this book is <i>African <b>American</b> Studies</i>, and, as a conceptual project, its center is on the exploration of black people in the United States. But, much like the field since its inception in the late 1960s, it is not fully constricted by geography. It is not exhaustive, but entries explore transnational concepts, relations, ideas and communities. Its breadth in content also makes its case for targeted readership.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>The audience for this book is a broad one. The book, naturally, operates as a useful resource for any college or graduate-level course in African American Studies. Major scholars in the field discuss how other scholars have organized around, implemented, discussed or otherwise utilized concepts and terms across space and time. This project asserts its utility in history, literature and social science courses. It is useful for seasoned scholars to familiarize themselves with terms that circulate outside their field. It is both a general introduction and a critical resource for greater interrogation of scholarly terms. It also works well for teachers and even advanced high school students.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>At this website, we will also provide resources for the use of this book in classrooms. This website will provide resources for students and teacher alike, who wish to find and explore creative ways to engage the entries. We want this to be a helpful resource for your classes—whether you are at either side of the lectern. For those outside of the classroom, this is also a resource. Learning, of course, has never been constricted to the walls of a school. We encourage readers to engage, return, make suggestions, and enjoy this project! <u></u><u></u></p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>We’re delighted to announce the publication of <strong><em><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/">Keywords for Environmental Studies</a></em></strong>, the fifth volume in <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/">NYU Press’s Keywords series</a></strong>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re delighted to announce the publication of <strong><em><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/">Keywords for Environmental Studies</a></em></strong>, the fifth volume in <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/">NYU Press’s Keywords series</a></strong>. Our goal in producing the volume has been to create a new “state of the field” inventory and analysis of the central terms and debates currently structuring the most exciting research in and across environmental studies, including the environmental humanities, environmental social sciences, sustainability sciences, and the sciences of nature.</p>
<p>The breadth of this approach means that while our volume shares many of the central features of the other books in the series—incisive essays on key terms in the field, a comprehensive bibliography, an open invitation to discussion and dialogue—it’s also unique in that our contributors hail not only from the humanities and social sciences but also from the environmental sciences. In this volume you will find contributions from distinguished voices in an appropriately wide range of areas, including art history, gender studies, literature, philosophy, and religion; anthropology, economics, geography, history, politics, and sociology; as well as biochemistry, biology, botany, ecology, and geology.</p>
<p>Given the global stakes of the field, we have also sought to give the volume a broad, international perspective. You will find contributors from many countries outside North America; we also asked all our contributors, where appropriate, to draw examples from the Global South as well as the Global North. We also recognize that many of the most fundamental terms we use in environmental studies—<strong>“<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/essay/nature/">nature</a>”</strong> is just one example—do not necessarily have the same meanings in different languages. And so we have not only included the keyword <strong>“<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/essay/translation/">Translation</a>”</strong> in the volume itself, we are also in the process of preparing translations of a selection of the essays themselves into multiple languages, which will eventually be posted on this website. We’ll have more information about that soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we look forward to hearing from you as you read through the volume and engage with the entries themselves. Like the other books in the series, <strong><em><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/">Keywords for Environmental Studies</a></em></strong> is not intended as a declaration but an invitation; it is not a definitive map but a provisional one. As we welcome you to the book, we in turn welcome your insights, suggestions, and provocations for the work ahead.</p>

<p class="p1">We plan to offer suggestions on how to use the book in the classroom via this website. Both of us teach large introductory courses for undergraduates and upper level seminars for graduate students, and we’ll aim to provide ideas and tips for connecting the project to each of these audiences, and with those in between.</p>
