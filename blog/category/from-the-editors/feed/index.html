<p>The session takes place on Friday, November 7, 2:00-3:45, Westin Bonaventure, Level 1, Beaudry B. Here’s the description from the conference program:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Keywords volumes for American cultural studies, Asian American studies, the study of children’s literature, disability studies, and environmental studies are either published, in press, or in progress. Each of the volumes aims to create a new inventory and analysis of the central terms used in their respective fields. The deeper roots of these projects may be found in Raymond Williams’s <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2043617">Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society</a> and in the iconic “blank pages” at the end of that volume. As Williams insisted, his book was not “a dictionary or glossary of a particular academic subject. . . . It is rather, the record of an inquiry into a vocabulary.” At their best, such inquiries provide both a critical map of the field under consideration and a methodological provocation to think in interdisciplinary and future-oriented ways about field formation. To use the language of this year’s conference theme, they allow us to explore “discursive grammars that generate alternate ways of living….to fantasize, describe and believe in living otherwise.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Occasioned by the forthcoming second edition of <a href="http://nyupress.org/books/9780814708019/">Keywords for American Cultural Studies</a> (with 30 new essays joining the original 64), the roundtable provides a space for critical reflection on the scholarly and pedagogical significance of these projects. It brings together editors of five keywords volumes (Keywords for American Cultural Studies, Keywords for Asian American Studies, Keywords for Children’s Literature, Keywords for Disability Studies, and Keywords for Environmental Studies), along with the editor-in-chief of the press that is publishing them. In brief opening presentations and then open discussion, the panelists will reflect on motivations for and experiences of using the rubric of the “keyword” as a means of producing texts that both document and shape the field of American Studies and its intersections with other areas of interdisciplinary study. They will also consider how their projects stretch the boundaries of conventional scholarly publication by enabling new forms of pedagogy in and beyond American Studies.</p>

To accompany and frame the publication, we asked her a few questions.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/author/lreckson/" target="_blank">Lindsay Reckson</a></strong>: I’ve been fascinated by the way that gesture emerges as a critical object across fields we tend to think of as relatively distinct: developmental linguistics, sociology, phenomenology, and performance studies, to name just a few. So part of what inspired me to approach gesture as a keyword was the definitional challenge of pinning down a term that is necessarily itinerant; in this sense, gesture names movements that demand the interdisciplinary moves central to American studies and cultural studies. I’ve also been inspired by a whole host of scholars (Robin Bernstein, Daphne Brooks, Carrie Noland, Joseph Roach, Rebecca Schneider and others) who write about gesture in ways that help us better understand the relationship between performance, power, and cultural memory. And while I’ve been mostly thinking about how gestures live in particular archives (and are themselves a kind of corporeal archive), I also think we have much to learn in the present from the specific gestures of protest movements like Occupy and Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p><strong>Burgett and Hendler</strong>: <em>What did you learn as you wrote the essay?</em></p>
<p><strong>Reckson</strong>: That gesture is having something of a critical moment! I’m especially thinking about how gesture figures in the rise of affect theory, the turn to surface reading, and (increasingly) political philosophy. In each of these critical formations, gestures are less semiotic than relational—they are about a particular orientation to the world as it plays out in movements that supplement, exceed, or estrange us from written or spoken language. This is part of what makes gesture central to the kind of ethical comportments that <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/author/lberlant/" target="_blank">Lauren Berlant</a> and Claudia Rankine, among others, have been articulating recently. If we think of gesture as a site for ethical inquiry, we can begin to understand “conditioning” as a double-edged process, one that indexes our bodily and experiential relationship to the world but also makes room for different ways of enduring and transforming it.</p>
<p><strong>Burgett and Hendler</strong>: <em>What one idea do you want to be sure that readers take away from the essay?</em></p>
<p><strong>Reckson</strong>: When we say something is “gestural,” we’re often dismissing its impact. Yet as I try to suggest, gestures operate at the intersection of everyday or seemingly ephemeral movements and the broader cultural forces that shape them. In this way, gestures are central to how we inhabit, understand, make, and remake the world.</p>
<p><strong>Burgett and Hendler</strong>: <em>What other keywords in the volume do you see as most closely linked to this term? What not-yet-written keyword essay would you most like to read?</em></p>
<p><strong>Reckson</strong>: In my essay, gesture is most closely linked to terms like <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/performance/" target="_blank">Performance</a>, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/body/" target="_blank">Body</a>, and <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/affect-2/" target="_blank">Affect</a>. But if we think about gesture as a kind of interface, there are also fascinating intersections with terms like <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/digital/" target="_blank">Digital</a> (which both demands and abstracts the physical gesture) and <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/technology/" target="_blank">Technology</a>. I’m increasingly interested in how minor, mundane, or technological gestures intersect with more spectacular forms of bodily resistance and resilience, such as those that we see all around us in certain forms of protest. So I’d love to see a keyword essay on &#8220;protest.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/author/mbartha/" target="_blank"><strong>Miriam Bartha</strong></a>: I began thinking about “skill” as a keyword in the process of a career transition from academic jobs to what is now called an “alt-ac” position. I took a workshop that very explicitly prompted participants to renarrate their professional qualifications in terms of skills. Once I landed a position, as assistant director of a humanities research center, I found myself engaged to talk about my “transferable skills” at professional development events for graduate students; managing projects engaging people with a wide spectrum of professional knowledges and practices; and thinking about how to facilitate the mutual recognitions/translations necessary to cross-sectoral partnerships. In this context, the term “skill” performed a lot of necessary work. At the same time, I heard a lot of disdain for the term among academic humanists, who preferred “knowledge” and “education” as terms of art. I became curious about the tensions in those discourses that were part of my own uneven professional identity.</p>
<p><strong>Burgett and Hendler: </strong><em>What did you learn as you wrote the essay?</em></p>
<p><strong>Bartha: </strong>I learned that the meanings of the term are deeply shaped by labor politics, the claims of educational institutions, and the self-understandings of laboring, creative, and professional classes. That all seems obvious enough in retrospective, but I am still struck by the simultaneous presence and absence of the term “skill” in everyday academic humanities discourse: we evaluate for it all the time, but it is not commonly a critical term for us.</p>
<p><strong>Burgett and Hendler: </strong><em>What one idea do you want to be sure that readers take away from the essay?</em></p>
<p><strong>Bartha: </strong>Simply that the meaning and value “skill” varies significantly according to historical, professional, and vernacular contexts and perspectives. I hope that this recognition lets us become more critical of our own attitudes towards the term, by helping us to place them, and invites a curiosity about how the term operates in different arenas.</p>
<p><strong>Burgett and Hendler: </strong><em>What other keywords in the volume do you see as most closely linked to this term?  What not-yet-written keyword essay would you most like to read?</em></p>
<p><strong><strong>Bartha: </strong> </strong>“<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/corporation/" target="_blank">Corporation</a>,” “<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/labor/" target="_blank">Labor</a>,” and to some degree “<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/class/" target="_blank">Class</a>” all reference the conflictual labor and management history tied to the term “skill.” “<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/science/" target="_blank">Science</a>” and “<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/literature/" target="_blank">Literature</a>” speak to the history and politics of knowledge and disciplines that underwrites the term in different contexts. “<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/technology/" target="_blank">Technology</a>” bridges both. In terms of to-be-written keywords: “administration,” “development,”  and “social justice.”</p>

<p>If you are interested in adding a keyword essay to this ongoing publication, please contact us. All submissions will be peer-reviewed (by us), and if yours is accepted, it will be copy-edited by NYU Press and published on the site, with search functions that link it to the other essays in the volume.</p>

<p>1)  Please send us syllabi and/or assignments that have used <em>Keywords for American Cultural Studies</em>.  We are committed to building a rich and useable archive on the site under “<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/in-the-classroom/syllabi-and-assignments/">Syllabi and Assignments.</a>”  All we need is the syllabus or assignment, along with a couple of lines about the course context, the shape of the project, and what worked and what needs work.  These courses and assignments do NOT need to have used the Keywords <a href="http://keywords.fordhamitac.org/wiki2/index.php?title=Welcome_to_the_Keywords_Collaboratory">Collaboratory</a> or other digital platforms to be useful.</p>
<p>2)  Please send an email <a href="mailto:keywords@fordham.edu">keywords@fordham.edu</a> if you are interested in authoring a post-publication essay that responds or adds to what is already in print and online.  These essays will be reviewed by us and published on the site where they will be searchable along with all of the other print and digital essays.  They can be all text or fully multi-modal.</p>
<p>We will be able to publicize any and all new contributions through the site, this blog, and other social media.  Looking forward to hearing from you about how you are using and responding to Keywords.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to announce the release of the newest edition of the <i>Keywords</i> series: <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/"><i>Keywords for African American Studies</i></a>. Our efforts, as co-editors, centered on reaching out to specialists across scholarly disciplines who can describe, with authority and clarity, the fundamental meanings and utilities of words that are essential to the discourse and exploration of African American Studies. An inherently interdisciplinary venture, this project employs a language that transcends the disciplinary prose of any one area of study. Historians, sociologists, literary scholars, political scientists, and other enrich this publication.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to announce the release of the newest edition of the <i>Keywords</i> series: <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/african-american-studies/"><i>Keywords for African American Studies</i></a>. Our efforts, as co-editors, centered on reaching out to specialists across scholarly disciplines who can describe, with authority and clarity, the fundamental meanings and utilities of words that are essential to the discourse and exploration of African American Studies. An inherently interdisciplinary venture, this project employs a language that transcends the disciplinary prose of any one area of study. Historians, sociologists, literary scholars, political scientists, and other enrich this publication. Each essay adds broader understanding of the field of what is alternatively known as Africana Studies or Black Studies.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>As the most recent iteration of the NYU Press <i>Keywords</i> series, the book builds upon the tradition of providing a critical source for engaging and understanding a wide range of terms and concepts that circulate in a field of study. Not only are these words defined, but they are discussed within a context of their utility among scholars of that subject. Here, the reader is guided through the corpus of scholarship and made aware of how keywords operate therein.   <u></u><u></u></p>
<p>The title is this book is <i>African <b>American</b> Studies</i>, and, as a conceptual project, its center is on the exploration of black people in the United States. But, much like the field since its inception in the late 1960s, it is not fully constricted by geography. It is not exhaustive, but entries explore transnational concepts, relations, ideas and communities. Its breadth in content also makes its case for targeted readership.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>The audience for this book is a broad one. The book, naturally, operates as a useful resource for any college or graduate-level course in African American Studies. Major scholars in the field discuss how other scholars have organized around, implemented, discussed or otherwise utilized concepts and terms across space and time. This project asserts its utility in history, literature and social science courses. It is useful for seasoned scholars to familiarize themselves with terms that circulate outside their field. It is both a general introduction and a critical resource for greater interrogation of scholarly terms. It also works well for teachers and even advanced high school students.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>At this website, we will also provide resources for the use of this book in classrooms. This website will provide resources for students and teacher alike, who wish to find and explore creative ways to engage the entries. We want this to be a helpful resource for your classes—whether you are at either side of the lectern. For those outside of the classroom, this is also a resource. Learning, of course, has never been constricted to the walls of a school. We encourage readers to engage, return, make suggestions, and enjoy this project! <u></u><u></u></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the four years since the launch of<em> <a href="http://nyupress.org/books/9780814758557/">Keywords for Children’s Literature</a></em> in print (2011), we’ve learned a lot from scholars and students who have used it. As Raymond Williams did, we wanted to provide a shared vocabulary — but, in our case, specifically for the disciplinarily diverse group of people who work in children’s literature. The field draws scholars and writers from Literature, Education, and Library and Information Science. We knew that misunderstandings between disciplines arose because key terms were used in different ways. Recording the historical and etymological traces of each of the original forty-nine key terms, our contributors explained how these words came to be used in conflicted ways in different disciplines. In so doing, they drew a new map of our common vocabulary, locating its regional conflicts and contested terrain.</p>
<p>Since they contain only what the cartographer deems plottable, all maps invite revision. Greater familiarity with the territory reveals previously unnoticed gaps in the terrain. <em>Keywords for Children’s Literature</em> has taken us—its co-editors—to many places, to Cambridge, to Oslo, to Maastricht and Los Angeles. In each place that we’ve talked about our project, we have made note of revisions we want to make to our original map. Though we explicitly focus on traditions in English, we aspire to do a second edition that is more international in scope—in terms of both the literature represented (scholarly and literary) and the authors of the Keywords essays. We always knew our map would be provisional, and so are delighted to see how these altered contours have been revealing themselves to us.</p>
<p>The vast (we are tempted to say <em>impossible</em>) task of mapping a field of scholarly inquiry is one of the great strengths of the books in <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/">NYU Press’s Keywords series</a>. From the moment they’re published, this family of books invites the reader into a conversation, as she or he questions the terms, the texts chosen, the words omitted and the words included. These maps are intellectual provocations that inspire students and teachers to query, object, revise, re-think. (Indeed, a popular assignment is to have students write an entry for a keyword that, in their estimation, is missing from the volume.) So, as we celebrate the launch of the (currently) five-volume inquiry into key critical terms, we invite you to peruse the online and print editions of <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/childrens-literature/"><em>Keywords for Children’s Literature</em></a>, ask questions, and join the conversation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are pleased to announce the publication of <em>Keywords for Disability Studies</em>.  As co-editors, we took seriously the mandate to represent the breadth and diversity of disability studies as an interdisciplinary field poised at the intersection of activism, scholarship, and lived experience.  The essays in this collection are designed to provide essential background and framing for important terms in the field, and also to explain how “disability” changes our understanding of terms that circulate broadly across the disciplines, such as “aesthetics,” “race,” “representation,” and “work.”  While individual essays define and historicize terms, <em>Keywords </em>is not intended to function as a fixed, encyclopedic survey of the field but rather as a series of interventions in what we hope will become an ongoing dialogue about the meaning and shape of disability studies.</p>
<p>The publication of <em>Keywords for Disability Studies</em> coincides with two important 25<sup>th</sup> anniversaries in the history of disability rights in the United States:  the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the renaming of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  These acts represent important milestones in the legal recognition of the rights of people with disabilities.  They are of global significance in that they were inspired by and would provide a model for legislative activism in other parts of the world.  Many of the essays in <em>Keywords </em>acknowledge the crucial accomplishments of these acts, while also pointing out the work that remains to be done to build a world more inclusive of people with disabilities.</p>
<p>As we conceptualized and structured our project, we were guided by other works in NYU’s <a href="http://nyupress.org/series/keywords/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Keywords</strong></em></a> series, especially <a href="http://nyupress.org/books/9780814708019/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Keywords for American Cultural Studies</strong></em></a> as well as  <a href="http://nyupress.org/books/9780814758557/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Keywords for Children’s Literature</strong></em></a> and <a href="http://nyupress.org/books/9781479803286/" target="_blank"><em>Keywords for Asian American Studies</em></a>. Along with forthcoming projects such as <em>Keywords in Environmental Studies</em>, we expect that our book will contribute to the series’ goal, which is to spark dialogue and create further opportunities to reconfigure our disciplines and fields in even more generative ways.</p>
<p><em>Keywords for Disability Studies</em> will be a valuable resource for scholars and teachers at all levels.  In collaboration with our contributors,, we have developed preliminary suggestions for classroom use, including sample assignments and syllabi  We hope that this feature of the book’s web site will grow and evolve as we learn more about how <em>Keywords </em>is actually being used by students and instructors in a variety of educational settings.  Given the exploratory and speculative nature of the essays in our volume, we also look forward to feedback about the content of individual entries, which may be revised and expanded across future editions of the volume.  Finally, we recognize that our list of keywords will always be partial.  We look forward to readers’ suggestions for new terms and to lively conversation about the volume’s contents as the field continues to grow and change.</p>
<p>It has been a great privilege to edit <em>Keywords for Disability Studies</em> because it has allowed us to learn from and collaborate with colleagues in many different disciplines and provided us the opportunity to give at least provisional shape to a vital, heterogeneous field.  We hope that the publication of our volume will create a foundation for continued collaboration that will include new voices, terms, and approaches.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>We’re delighted to announce the publication of <strong><em><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/">Keywords for Environmental Studies</a></em></strong>, the fifth volume in <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/">NYU Press’s Keywords series</a></strong>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re delighted to announce the publication of <strong><em><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/">Keywords for Environmental Studies</a></em></strong>, the fifth volume in <strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/">NYU Press’s Keywords series</a></strong>. Our goal in producing the volume has been to create a new “state of the field” inventory and analysis of the central terms and debates currently structuring the most exciting research in and across environmental studies, including the environmental humanities, environmental social sciences, sustainability sciences, and the sciences of nature.</p>
<p>The breadth of this approach means that while our volume shares many of the central features of the other books in the series—incisive essays on key terms in the field, a comprehensive bibliography, an open invitation to discussion and dialogue—it’s also unique in that our contributors hail not only from the humanities and social sciences but also from the environmental sciences. In this volume you will find contributions from distinguished voices in an appropriately wide range of areas, including art history, gender studies, literature, philosophy, and religion; anthropology, economics, geography, history, politics, and sociology; as well as biochemistry, biology, botany, ecology, and geology.</p>
<p>Given the global stakes of the field, we have also sought to give the volume a broad, international perspective. You will find contributors from many countries outside North America; we also asked all our contributors, where appropriate, to draw examples from the Global South as well as the Global North. We also recognize that many of the most fundamental terms we use in environmental studies—<strong>“<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/essay/nature/">nature</a>”</strong> is just one example—do not necessarily have the same meanings in different languages. And so we have not only included the keyword <strong>“<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/essay/translation/">Translation</a>”</strong> in the volume itself, we are also in the process of preparing translations of a selection of the essays themselves into multiple languages, which will eventually be posted on this website. We’ll have more information about that soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we look forward to hearing from you as you read through the volume and engage with the entries themselves. Like the other books in the series, <strong><em><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/">Keywords for Environmental Studies</a></em></strong> is not intended as a declaration but an invitation; it is not a definitive map but a provisional one. As we welcome you to the book, we in turn welcome your insights, suggestions, and provocations for the work ahead.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been two years since we launched <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/latina-latino-studies/"><em>Keywords for Latina/o Studies</em> </a>(2017) and we are heartened by the wonderful response, positive reception, and wide adoption for courses by professors.   Our intent from the beginning was to create a shared dialogue and vocabulary, a site for critical thinking, and to contribute the ongoing project of Latina/o/x Studies. To our amazement this dialogue is happening, and we as the editors, would like to impart what we have learned with you.  In turn, we invite you to let us know how <em>Keywords </em>has assisted you with your teaching, research, and writing.  We welcome critiques and suggestions for improving <em>Keywords.</em>  For example, as we explained in <em>Keywords,</em> there are omissions of terms that we plan to include in future editions. As well, the term Latinx grew in prominence after we had completed the bulk of the project. We understand and agree that the term “x” is a critical turn in the ongoing political potential in the field of Latina/o/x Studies, and we believe that a project like <em>Keywords</em> encourages us to think about and discuss the importance and use of such terms.</p>
<p>As part of the NYU Press <em>Keywords</em> series, the book builds upon the tradition of providing a critical source for engaging and understanding a wide range of terms and concepts that circulate in a field of study. Here, the reader is guided through the corpus of scholarship and made aware of how keywords operate therein. The bibliographical citations point to further directions that interested readers can pursue.</p>
<p>The audience for this book is a broad one. The volume, naturally, operates as a useful resource for any college or graduate-level course in Latina/o/x, Ethnic, and American Studies. Major scholars in the field discuss how other scholars have organized around, implemented, discussed or otherwise utilized concepts and terms across space and time. This project asserts its utility in history, literature and social science courses. It is also useful for seasoned scholars to familiarize themselves with terms that circulate outside their field. It is both a general introduction and a critical resource for greater interrogation of scholarly terms.</p>

Learning, of course, has never been constricted to the walls of a school. We encourage readers to engage, return, make suggestions, and enjoy this project.</p>
<p>As co-editors, we are excited that our volume has been useful to so many readers. We encourage you to embrace a field that is complex, dynamic, and ever-changing; one that maps Latina/o/x experiences in the United States in a transnational, hemispheric framework. ¡Pa’lante!</p>
