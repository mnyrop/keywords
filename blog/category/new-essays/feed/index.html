To accompany and frame the publication, we asked her a few questions.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/author/lreckson/" target="_blank">Lindsay Reckson</a></strong>: I’ve been fascinated by the way that gesture emerges as a critical object across fields we tend to think of as relatively distinct: developmental linguistics, sociology, phenomenology, and performance studies, to name just a few. So part of what inspired me to approach gesture as a keyword was the definitional challenge of pinning down a term that is necessarily itinerant; in this sense, gesture names movements that demand the interdisciplinary moves central to American studies and cultural studies. I’ve also been inspired by a whole host of scholars (Robin Bernstein, Daphne Brooks, Carrie Noland, Joseph Roach, Rebecca Schneider and others) who write about gesture in ways that help us better understand the relationship between performance, power, and cultural memory. And while I’ve been mostly thinking about how gestures live in particular archives (and are themselves a kind of corporeal archive), I also think we have much to learn in the present from the specific gestures of protest movements like Occupy and Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p><strong>Burgett and Hendler</strong>: <em>What did you learn as you wrote the essay?</em></p>
<p><strong>Reckson</strong>: That gesture is having something of a critical moment! I’m especially thinking about how gesture figures in the rise of affect theory, the turn to surface reading, and (increasingly) political philosophy. In each of these critical formations, gestures are less semiotic than relational—they are about a particular orientation to the world as it plays out in movements that supplement, exceed, or estrange us from written or spoken language. This is part of what makes gesture central to the kind of ethical comportments that <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/author/lberlant/" target="_blank">Lauren Berlant</a> and Claudia Rankine, among others, have been articulating recently. If we think of gesture as a site for ethical inquiry, we can begin to understand “conditioning” as a double-edged process, one that indexes our bodily and experiential relationship to the world but also makes room for different ways of enduring and transforming it.</p>
<p><strong>Burgett and Hendler</strong>: <em>What one idea do you want to be sure that readers take away from the essay?</em></p>
<p><strong>Reckson</strong>: When we say something is “gestural,” we’re often dismissing its impact. Yet as I try to suggest, gestures operate at the intersection of everyday or seemingly ephemeral movements and the broader cultural forces that shape them. In this way, gestures are central to how we inhabit, understand, make, and remake the world.</p>
<p><strong>Burgett and Hendler</strong>: <em>What other keywords in the volume do you see as most closely linked to this term? What not-yet-written keyword essay would you most like to read?</em></p>
<p><strong>Reckson</strong>: In my essay, gesture is most closely linked to terms like <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/performance/" target="_blank">Performance</a>, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/body/" target="_blank">Body</a>, and <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/affect-2/" target="_blank">Affect</a>. But if we think about gesture as a kind of interface, there are also fascinating intersections with terms like <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/digital/" target="_blank">Digital</a> (which both demands and abstracts the physical gesture) and <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/technology/" target="_blank">Technology</a>. I’m increasingly interested in how minor, mundane, or technological gestures intersect with more spectacular forms of bodily resistance and resilience, such as those that we see all around us in certain forms of protest. So I’d love to see a keyword essay on &#8220;protest.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/author/mbartha/" target="_blank"><strong>Miriam Bartha</strong></a>: I began thinking about “skill” as a keyword in the process of a career transition from academic jobs to what is now called an “alt-ac” position. I took a workshop that very explicitly prompted participants to renarrate their professional qualifications in terms of skills. Once I landed a position, as assistant director of a humanities research center, I found myself engaged to talk about my “transferable skills” at professional development events for graduate students; managing projects engaging people with a wide spectrum of professional knowledges and practices; and thinking about how to facilitate the mutual recognitions/translations necessary to cross-sectoral partnerships. In this context, the term “skill” performed a lot of necessary work. At the same time, I heard a lot of disdain for the term among academic humanists, who preferred “knowledge” and “education” as terms of art. I became curious about the tensions in those discourses that were part of my own uneven professional identity.</p>
<p><strong>Burgett and Hendler: </strong><em>What did you learn as you wrote the essay?</em></p>
<p><strong>Bartha: </strong>I learned that the meanings of the term are deeply shaped by labor politics, the claims of educational institutions, and the self-understandings of laboring, creative, and professional classes. That all seems obvious enough in retrospective, but I am still struck by the simultaneous presence and absence of the term “skill” in everyday academic humanities discourse: we evaluate for it all the time, but it is not commonly a critical term for us.</p>
<p><strong>Burgett and Hendler: </strong><em>What one idea do you want to be sure that readers take away from the essay?</em></p>
<p><strong>Bartha: </strong>Simply that the meaning and value “skill” varies significantly according to historical, professional, and vernacular contexts and perspectives. I hope that this recognition lets us become more critical of our own attitudes towards the term, by helping us to place them, and invites a curiosity about how the term operates in different arenas.</p>
<p><strong>Burgett and Hendler: </strong><em>What other keywords in the volume do you see as most closely linked to this term?  What not-yet-written keyword essay would you most like to read?</em></p>
<p><strong><strong>Bartha: </strong> </strong>“<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/corporation/" target="_blank">Corporation</a>,” “<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/labor/" target="_blank">Labor</a>,” and to some degree “<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/class/" target="_blank">Class</a>” all reference the conflictual labor and management history tied to the term “skill.” “<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/science/" target="_blank">Science</a>” and “<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/literature/" target="_blank">Literature</a>” speak to the history and politics of knowledge and disciplines that underwrites the term in different contexts. “<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/technology/" target="_blank">Technology</a>” bridges both. In terms of to-be-written keywords: “administration,” “development,”  and “social justice.”</p>

<p>In that spirit, we&#8217;re very pleased to announce the publication of two new keyword essays, both of which are now part of <em>Keywords for American Cultural Studies</em>: &#8220;<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/gesture/">Gesture</a>&#8221; by Lindsay Reckson; and &#8220;<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/skill/">Skill</a>&#8221; by Miriam Bartha. They appear under “Post-Publication Essays” on the <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/">site</a> (in the left navigation, under “Essays”). Each of these new keyword essays expands the disciplinary and conceptual scope of the project in new and exciting directions, which we discuss in brief interviews with <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/blog/2015/10/interview-with-lindsay-reckson-author-of-gesture/">Reckson</a> and <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/blog/2015/10/interview-with-miriam-bartha-author-of-skill/">Bartha</a> about the why, what, and what next of their thinking.  These interviews will appear tomorrow here on the <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/blog/"><em>Keywords</em> blog</a>.</p>
<p>If you are interested in adding a keyword essay to this ongoing publication, please contact us. All submissions will be peer-reviewed (by us), and if yours is accepted, it will be copy-edited by NYU Press and published on the site, with search functions that link it to the other essays in the volume.</p>

<p>We came away from the conference even more excited by conversations we had about the volume with lots of folks, including the editors of the other keyword books coming out from NYU Press in the near future.  Many of those conversations focused on the uses that individuals have made of the first edition in courses and/or the additional keywords they were interested in working on or reading, including terms such as “safety” and “gesture.”</p>
<p>We want to repeat here what we said to many at the conference.  We are very interested in two forms of post-publication response to the print/digital volume.</p>
<p>1)  Please send us syllabi and/or assignments that have used <em>Keywords for American Cultural Studies</em>.  We are committed to building a rich and useable archive on the site under “<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/in-the-classroom/syllabi-and-assignments/">Syllabi and Assignments.</a>”  All we need is the syllabus or assignment, along with a couple of lines about the course context, the shape of the project, and what worked and what needs work.  These courses and assignments do NOT need to have used the Keywords <a href="http://keywords.fordhamitac.org/wiki2/index.php?title=Welcome_to_the_Keywords_Collaboratory">Collaboratory</a> or other digital platforms to be useful.</p>
<p>2)  Please send an email <a href="mailto:keywords@fordham.edu">keywords@fordham.edu</a> if you are interested in authoring a post-publication essay that responds or adds to what is already in print and online.  These essays will be reviewed by us and published on the site where they will be searchable along with all of the other print and digital essays.  They can be all text or fully multi-modal.</p>
<p>We will be able to publicize any and all new contributions through the site, this blog, and other social media.  Looking forward to hearing from you about how you are using and responding to Keywords.</p>
