				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The relationship between media and citizenship is contradictory and evolving. Since the rise of mass media, social scientists and critics have worried about its deleterious impact on democracy. Such concerns typically hinge on the assumption that commercial media trade on trivial pleasures, emotions, and consumer values that inhibit public participation in political affairs. However, mass media have also been understood as “citizen machines” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/mccarthy-anna-se/">McCarthy 2010</a>) that can be harnessed to guide and shape the citizenry (or segments of it) for democracy and public life—an agenda that gave rise to twentieth-century national public broadcasting systems (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/ouellette-laurie-se/">Ouellette 2002</a>). The proliferation, fragmentation, and globalization of media culture in recent decades, and the development of new conceptual frameworks (such as cultural studies) to analyze it, have required a critical reevaluation of citizenship. While the marginalized and degraded state of “serious” news and public information remains a pressing concern for many, a growing body of critical scholarship recognizes the role of popular entertainment in constituting citizenship as a social identity and everyday practice that is not limited to the formal political sphere.</p>
<p>Citizenship has traditionally referred to the status of belonging to a political body and having rights and duties as a member or subject. The term stems from the Latin word <em>civitas</em>, or people of a city, the locus of organized government in ancient times (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/bellamy-richard/">Bellamy 2008</a>). With the rise of nation-states, Benedict Anderson (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/anderson-benedict/">1991</a>) famously argues, citizenship became bound to “imagined communities” that transcended local connections. The commercial printing press was crucial to this process: books, newspapers, calendars, and other printed materials standardized language and discourse, encouraging dispersed citizen-subjects to recognize commonalities and making it possible to govern within a national framework. For Anderson, this emergent “print capitalism” was pivotal in the shift from monarchy to democracy.</p>
<p>Founded on liberal ideals of self-government, early modern democracies like the United States continued to experiment with direct, face-to-face participation in political rule, as exemplified by the agrarian town hall. However, exercising citizenship on a national scale ultimately involved layers of mediation: the selection of representatives to “stand in” for the people, the distribution of symbolic resources (such as universal education and information) to steer public participation, and the construction of national identity itself. The speed and scale of industrial capitalism, waves of immigration and urbanization, and the solidification of consumer culture secured the mediated nature of modern citizenship. While mass media (penny newspapers, magazines, cinema, radio) were crucial to the development of mass democracy in the West, these mass communication technologies threatened the viability of democratic processes in the eyes of alarmed intellectuals and early media researchers. With each new mass medium, complaints about the distracting, “dumbed down” influence of entertainment on the populace surfaced, and by the 1920s, social critics like Walter Lippmann were questioning whether popular participation in democracy was desirable or even possible given the banalities and distortions attributed to media and modern life. Lippmann’s treatise <em>Public Opinion </em>(<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/lippmann-walter/">1922</a>) called for a class of educated experts to “restore reason to politics” and relieve the masses from the burden of having an “informed” opinion (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/ouellette-laurie-se/">Ouellette 2002, 111</a>).</p>
<p>Mass communication research codified this recommendation in the theory of the “two-step flow,” which identified a subset of “opinion leaders” who read newspapers and sought out public affairs broadcasts modeled after print journalism as the natural leaders of democracy. This rationalization soothed anxieties about the masses of consumers who preferred the cheap distractions churned out by commercial radio and the new medium of television. The equation of democracy with the printed word partly evidenced nostalgia for the era of print capitalism, but it also cast the socially legitimated tastes, habits, and dispositions of educated white men as prerequisites for “enlightened” participation in the political process.</p>
<p>This tendency was not unique to social science. The ideal of the rational and informed citizen has long been a trope in critical media analysis as well. This work often evokes the public sphere, theorized by <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/habermas-jurgen-se/">Jürgen Habermas (1989)</a> as public spaces separate from the market and the state, where people can act as citizens by deliberating issues, advocating positions, and forming “publics” with collective interests. Habermas cites the coffee houses of the eighteenth century, where learned men would gather to discuss and deliberate upon public affairs as prototypes; today such public spaces are often mediated and virtual. While public sphere theory points to the urgent need for independent media not beholden to market pressures, proponents have glossed over the bourgeoisie origins and dictates of the public sphere in practice. Rules of decorum and the emphasis on rational discourse over emotionally and bodily invested forms of participation (such as union meetings or protests) have historically excluded women, the working classes, and people of color from exercising agency in the “public” spaces described by Habermas, a problem abundantly noted by many feminist critics, Marxist theorists, and critical race scholars (see <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/fraser-nancy/">Fraser 1990</a>).</p>
<p>Despite these critiques, the model of citizenship associated with the bourgeois public sphere continues to resonate well beyond the university. The notion of a rational public committed to debating differences and advancing common interests within predominantly national contexts retains currency, even as developments in late capitalism (including the intensification of market values, transnational cultural flows, and the proliferation of ever more specialized consumer niches) undermine this ideal. Since the 1990s, media scholars trained in cultural studies and political theory have questioned this definition of political citizenship, and tracked the shifting shape that citizenship takes in contemporary times. Some of this work situates the perceived failures of democracy within the broader tensions of liberal capitalist democracies. For example, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/miller-toby/">Toby Miller (1993)</a> has persuasively shown how the competing demands of the consumer economy (which encourages selfishness, pleasure, and hedonism) and the political order (which requires rationality, discipline, and responsibility) generate a perpetual sense of inadequacy. Because citizens are perceived to be perpetually “at risk” of failing to fulfill their duties and obligations, initiatives from public broadcasting to Univision’s Citizenship Month have operated as corrective cultural technologies or forms of citizenship training.</p>
<p>Other scholars have questioned the assumption that popular media impede rather than enrich the political process. <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/jones-jeffrey-p/">Jeffrey Jones (2006)</a>, for example, rejects the hierarchy that values the democratic function of news over entertainment. Jones contends that the consumption of popular media can also foster political engagement and that satirical fake news programs like <em>The </em><em>Daily Show </em>may encourage a more critical understanding of the “reality” of politics and the state than traditional news or public affairs media (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/jones-jeffrey-p/">380</a>). Jones’s “cultural approach” to mediated citizenship offers an optimistic alternative to purists who lament the decline of newspapers and associate the ritualized consumption of television with antidemocratic attributes such as passivity, hedonism, and “distraction.” Along similar lines, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/van-zoonen-liesbet-se/">Liesbet Van Zoonen (2004)</a> contends that the convergence of politics and entertainment in recent decades—from the election of Hollywood icons for political office to the appearance of television dramas built around government officials like <em>The West Wing </em>and <em>House of Cards</em>—signals the “rejuvenation” of democratic citizenship, not its end point. While these perspectives reclaim an affirmative role for popular media in political culture, they themselves risk upholding the equation of democracy and citizenship with the official events, institutions, and figures of the political sphere.</p>
<p>Feminist and queer scholars have called for a more radical revision of what counts as “political” and where and how citizenship takes place. The robust scholarship on the daytime talk shows of the 1990s explored how these heavily stage-managed and ratings-driven television programs brought ordinary people and the intimacies of everyday life into the public sphere. While talk shows turned private experiences and problems into spectacles, they also presented a mediated forum for discussing social issues such as rape, poverty, mental illness, and discrimination from the ground up. The personal was (at least potentially) deeply political, and the rules of decorum and social exclusions of the white, masculine, bourgeois public sphere did not apply. For scholars like <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/gamson-joshua/">Joshua Gamson (1999)</a>, talk shows expanded the boundaries of political life and offered a rare opportunity for marginalized groups to “represent” themselves within the constraints of commercial television. As the political climate of the 1990s shifted, these shows gave way to authoritarian forms of citizenship training, epitomized by <em>Judge Judy </em>(discussed below).</p>
<p>Another intervention challenges the nationalist framework in which mediated citizenship has traditionally been conceived. Globalization, migration, and the transnational flow of media culture have encouraged “disjunctures” in national identity (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/appadurai-arjun-se/">Appadurai 1990</a>) that require scholars to theorize citizenship in new terms. In his research on media use among diasporic communities, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/cunningham-stuart/">Stuart Cunningham (1991)</a> argues that the national public sphere has given way to ethnospecific “sphericules,” or social fragments that provide a site for public communication and hybrid forms of belonging (often through commercially traded videocassettes, music videos, and other popular media forms) beyond boundaries of the nation-state. <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/spigel-lynn-se/">Lynn Spigel (2007)</a> takes this further, arguing that nationalism “as a cultural dominant” is also losing currency in Western democracies like the United States, because it no longer fits with the economic and cultural practices of late capitalist media and society. As narrowcasting, niche marketing, and an appeal to subcultures have become “central to global capitalism,” media content has assumed a “culture that is deeply divided by taste, not one that is unified through national narratives” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/spigel-lynn-se/">640</a>). The fragmentation of media culture in the age of five hundred channels also changes the contours of mediated citizenship, as evidenced by the rise of niche-oriented political brands like Fox News.</p>
<p>While the nation remains the basis of legal citizenship, the practice of citizenship has—for better or worse—become more consumer-oriented. Today, our sense of belonging is often rooted in our consumption practices and brand communities as much as in formal political bodies. Drawing from the cultural theorist <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/garcia-canclini-nestor-se-2/">Néstor García-Canclini (2001)</a>, Sarah Banet-Weiser contends that if the nation-state retains currency as a basis for membership and belonging, its definition has come to hinge on interpretative communities of consumers. Within the current context of proliferating media channels, narrowcasting, globalization, and transnational cultural flows, she contends, the “shared identity of consumers is increasingly one of the most meaningful national connections among members of a community” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/banet-weiser-sarah/">2007, 10</a>). Banet-Weiser sees the shift toward what she calls consumer citizenship as a reconciliation of the competing demands of the consumer economy and the political order theorized by Miller. Increasingly, brands (including media brands like Fox, MTV, and Bravo) encourage us to actualize our rights, duties, and sense of belonging as citizens <em>within </em>the sphere of consumption. The children’s cable network Nickelodeon, the focus of Banet-Weiser’s study, claims to “empower” its viewers to exercise their right to make consumer choices and simultaneously escape adult rules through membership in the Nickelodeon Nation. The network fuses the promise of political and cultural power—and cleverly connects both to participation in and identification with the niche-oriented Nickelodeon brand.</p>
<p>The rising currency of corporate social responsibility, which has largely replaced state regulation of the public interest in media culture, stitches political citizenship into consumer culture and brand communities in more explicitly political ways. Most media conglomerates, including Disney and Time Warner, now pursue robust “socially responsible” agendas as part of their corporate brand strategies. From encouraging volunteerism and charitable giving to inserting prosocial messages into television content, media corporations pursue citizenship training to bolster their corporate image, which can translate into profit. My own work on media ventures like <em>Oprah’s Big Give </em>and the ABC TV network’s Better Community Campaign (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/ouellette-laurie-se-2/">Ouellette 2012</a>) shows how corporate social responsibility stitches the demands of the political order into the symbolic boundaries of media brands, which then become venues for traditional forms of civic belonging as well as newer forms of consumer membership. Within this context, the pursuit of “good citizenship” does not contradict the aims of the consumer economy, but is folded into them.</p>
<p>In recent years, a burgeoning strand of media scholarship has tracked the offloading of duties and services historically performed by the state onto corporations and individual consumers. The shift from the regulation of the public interest, which assumes public oversight, to corporate social responsibility is one example; the surge of media devoted to transforming individuals into more enterprising, responsible, self-reliant, and marketable versions of themselves is another. Reality TV has received particular attention as a “technology of neoliberal citizenship” that translates shifting ideas about democracy and government into regimes for everyday living. Reality TV gained visibility and currency in the early 2000s, in the wake of attempts to privatize public institutions and downsize the postwar welfare state. Neoliberal policies and discourses that apply market logic to every dimension of society were gaining hold in political discourse and the policy sector, and reality programming in the United States was one of the clearest cultural expressions of this political shift. Scholars have noted how reality TV competitions, makeovers, docusoaps, and interventions equate “good citizenship” with personal responsibility (see <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/ouellette-laurie-and-james-hay/">Ouellette and Hay 2008</a>), while also offering marketoriented social identities, behavioral norms, advice, and templates for self-maximization and personal entrepreneurship. Scholars around the world, especially in Europe, have observed similar neoliberal tendencies in reality TV, as market logic has intensified and programs of privatization and welfare reform have taken hold on a global scale.</p>
<p>The growth of the Internet, social media, and interactive mobile devices (including phones) in the past decade has intensified the long-standing debate over media and citizenship—with no clear resolution. Some scholars are pessimistic about new media’s capacity to undo problems of commercialism and political passivity. We may be able to “vote” for our favorite TV idols, share political information and opinions (as well as GIFs, memes and the contents of our lunch) at the touch of a button, or even participate in new forms of “clicktivism” and hashtag activism, but doing so—they argue—is merely a new form of distraction that prevents substantive participation in democracy and stymies political change (see <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/dean-jodi/">J. Dean 2010</a>). Other scholars, however, are cautiously optimistic about the extent to which social media, mobile devices, and other new media technologies afford opportunities to redefine the pub lic sphere, formulate mediated publics around diverse issues and identities, and develop new forms of political engagement. Such possibilities are not automatic or inherent to new technologies, but they can manifest under particular social and political conditions. One thing is clear: just as earlier activists understood the pivotal role of mass media in their efforts to transform political life, as suggested by the infamous slogan “The Whole World Is Watching,” today’s social and political movements recognize the centrality of interactive digital media platforms. From WeChat’s role in political activism in China to the use of Twitter by the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States, new media technologies are equally integral to contemporary demands being made on the nation, the public, and the state.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking back from the vantage point of the twenty-first century, early analysis of gender and media is notable for the extraordinary <em>confidence </em>of the analyses produced. Reviewing a decade of studies in the late 1970s, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/tuchman-gaye-se/">Gaye Tuchman (1978b)</a> unequivocally titled her article “The Symbolic Annihilation of Women by the Mass Media” and wrote of how women were being destroyed by a combination of “absence,” “trivialization,” and “condemnation.” Such clear evaluations were not unique and were often accompanied by similarly robust calls to action—whether voiced as demands for more women in the industry, campaigns for “positive images,” or “guerrilla interventions” into billboard advertisements. Writing about this period of research on gender and the media, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/mcrobbie-angela-se-2/">Angela McRobbie (1999)</a> characterized it as one of “angry repudiation.”</p>
<p>By the late 1980s, this angry certainty had largely given way to something more equivocal and complex. As <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/macdonald-myra/">Myra Macdonald (1995)</a> noted, one reason was that media content changed dramatically. The notion that the media offered a relatively stable template of femininity to which to aspire gave way as media offered a more plural and fragmented set a of signifiers of gender. There was a new playfulness in media representations, a borrowing of codes between different genres, and a growing awareness and interest in processes of image construction. Media content was shaped by producers and consumers who were increasingly “media savvy” and familiar with the terms of cultural critique, including feminism (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/goldman-robert/">Goldman 1992</a>). Feminist critiques made their way into media content, exemplified by Nike advertising that critiqued media for offering unrealistic images of women, and L’Oréal advertising that addressed female anger about constantly being addressed in terms of unattainable images of female beauty (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/gill-rosalind/">Gill 2007a</a>). Another striking feature of advertising of the 1990s and early 2000s was its use of strategies highlighting female empowerment, agency, and choice—taking a cue from feminist ideas but emptying them of their political force and offering them back to women in terms of products that may make them feel powerful (but won’t actually change anything) (Gill 2008).</p>
<p>The early twenty-first century has seen further important shifts, including a proliferation of different theoretical languages for discussing media representations of gender. What <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/van-zoonen-liesbet/">Liesbet Van Zoonen (1994)</a> has characterized as the “transmission model” of media was replaced by more constructionist, poststructuralistinfluenced accounts. These tend to see meaning as fluid, unstable, and contradictory, and to emphasize the media’s role in constructing subjectivity and identity.</p>
<p>Scholarship has also been influenced by queer theory, which has produced “gender trouble” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/butler-judith/">Butler 1990</a>), interrogating traditional understandings of a gender binary, based on cisgendered males and females, and highlighting performative rather than essentialist readings of gender. This has brought to the fore questions about trans and genderqueer, opening up space for thinking about both gender and sexuality in more open terms, which might include, for example, “female masculinities” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/halberstam-judith/">Halberstam 1998</a>). Queer theory has also been influential in offering alternative readings of cultural products, and in “queering” contemporary media.</p>
<p>Another shift is growing interest in representations of men and masculinity. This has been particularly evident in film studies and research on the proliferation of men’s magazines or “lad mags” such as <em>FHM</em>, <em>Loaded</em>, <em>Zoo</em>, and <em>Nuts</em>. Some research has examined the way the media are implicated in dominant representations of masculinity such as the figures of “new man,” “new lad,” “metrosexual,” “hipster,” or “lumbersexual”—which come to be powerful popular means of reading and understanding masculine identities, endlessly recycled in marketing, PR, academic, and journalistic texts until they come to seem like reflections of reality rather than particular constructions. Another focus is on changing representations of the male body in sites such as advertising or fashion magazines—including the mainstreaming of eroticized or idealized images of the male body that represent a challenge to earlier understandings that “men look and women appear” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/berger-john/">Berger 1972</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/mulvey-laura/">Mulvey 1975</a>). Iconic figures such as David Beckham and David Gandy have been central to this shift, which has led to discussions about whether “sexual objectification” is now a routine practice for depicting men as well as women, and raising questions about masculinity “in crisis.”</p>
<p>A concern with “intersectionality” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/crenshaw-kimberle/">Crenshaw 1989</a>) has also animated contemporary interests in gender and media. It seeks to understand the connections between multiple axes of oppression and exclusion, on the understanding that these are not simply “additive” but constitute distinct experiences and subjectivities. In media studies, the notion has challenged singular definitions of “woman,” and—with postcolonial and mestizaje interventions—has argued for a far greater specificity in accounts of how gender is mediated, thereby helping to create space for a multiplicity of foci on—for example—constructions of Latina/Chicana, African American, or Asian American women in the media, and pushing beyond the whiteness of dominant theorizing. This is linked in turn—though is not reducible to—a marked interest in questions about global media among gender scholars. At its most straightforward, this has translated into a greater international focus and more cross-national comparisons, such as the Global Media Monitoring Project, which, in a series of reports since 1995, has indicated the woeful representation of women in news genres across the world—showing up disproportionately as victims rather than as journalists or experts. An interest in globalization has also produced a focus on how representations “travel” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/machin-david-and-joanna-thornborrow/">Machin and Thornborrow 2003</a>) or, alternatively, how they are designed to have appeal across multiple contexts. <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/lazar-michelle-m/">Michelle Lazar (2006)</a> has produced fascinating research about globalized advertising in Asia, pointing to the construction of an almost “identikit” image of desirable youthful femininity: the ideal model should look a little bit Indian, a little bit Thai, and a little bit Malaysian and is carefully designed to exemplify a “pan-Asian blend” of “consumer sisterhood.” More recently, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/koffman-ofra-shani-orgad-and-rosalind-gill/">Ofra Koffman, Shani Orgad, and Rosalind Gill (2015)</a> have examined how ideas about “girl power” materialize in different national and transnational contexts, constructing an idealized neoliberal feminine subject.</p>
<p>Another major development has been the “turn to production” in media studies, which for gender analysts has focused attention on persistent inequalities in the media labor force. This is horizontally segregated and vertically segregated, meaning that women are both concentrated in particular areas—for example within filmmaking they are disproportionately found in “makeup” or “wardrobe” functions—and are also concentrated lower in the hierarchy of desirable roles. Martha Lauzen’s important research on Hollywood highlights the long-term lack of women in key creative roles such as cinematographer or director, with only one female Academy Award winner for best director— Kathryn Bigelow—in its history (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/lauzen-martha/">2015</a>).</p>
<p>Some research has been concerned with whether the lack of women in key creative roles impacts the kinds of media that get produced. Television seems to be doing better than film both in the diversity of its workforce and in the range of shows that get made, with <em>Girls</em>, <em>The Good Wife</em>, <em>Orange Is the New Black</em>, and <em>Damages</em>, for example, featuring “strong” women on both sides of the camera. Other research has examined the reasons for continued inequalities in media worlds that pride themselves on being “cool, creative, and egalitarian,” but seem in reality to be anything but. <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/jones-deborah-and-judith-k/">Deborah Jones and Judith Pringle (2015)</a> have pointed to the dominance of small-scale, project-based employment in the media and creative industries, arguing that it gives rise to “unmanageable inequalities”—through processes of finding work, hiring, and evaluation that are largely informal and lie outside legislative apparatuses designed to protect equal rights. In turn, others have called attention to the meritocratic and neoliberal dominance of media and cultural fields, which instill an idea that sexism (and racism) are “over” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/ahmed-sara-se/">Ahmed 2012</a>) and cultivate a climate of “gender fatigue” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/kelan-elisabeth-k/">Kelan 2009</a>) in which inequalities become “unspeakable” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/gill-rosalind-se-3/">Gill 2014</a>)—problems that are connected to a postfeminist sensibility (see below). Feminist research on media labor has also generated new topics of interest such as aesthetic labor and affective or emotional labor—highlighting the extent to which an ever increasing range of “soft” skills and qualities are put to work in a moment of passionate capitalism (see <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/elias-ana-sofia-rosalind-gill-and-christina-scharff-eds/">Elias, Gill, and Scharff 2016</a>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the boundaries of media production have been called into question by reality TV programs featuring “ordinary people” rather than professionals. New media are also said to have collapsed distinctions between producers and consumers, rendering many of us—simultaneously—as both. Early feminist research on the Internet looked at gendered practices in online sites such as chat rooms and multiuser dungeons. Approaches tended to be polarized between, on the one hand, techno-utopians who believed the World Wide Web would offer unparalleled opportunities to transcend the body and to explore futures devoid of social divisions such as gender, and, on the other, the cyberpessimists who argued that the technology could never escape its origins in the military-industrial complex and who pointed to new forms of oppression that were practiced in online communities, for example, flaming, trolling, and cyberbullying. In the past few years, the excesses of both positions have given way to more measured and cautious research, exploring (for example) the impact of dating sites on the way in which people conduct their intimate relationships, or the emerging forms of sociality on network sites such as Facebook and Snapchat. Self-representation has become a key topic of interest (for example, selfies, sexting), as has the proliferation of different forms of surveillance—from the “top-down” surveillance of media companies such as Google and Facebook to the peer surveillance (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/ringrose-jessica-laura-harvey-rosalind-gill-and-sonia-livingstone/">Ringrose et al. 2013</a>) and the “girlfriend gaze” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/winch-alison/">Winch 2014</a>) of social media or the self-monitoring of mobile phone apps that track exercise, calorie intake, weight, and beauty regimes (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/elias-ana-sofia-and-rosalind-gill/">Elias and Gill forthcoming</a>).</p>
<p>A crucial concept in contemporary studies of gender and media is “postfeminism.” The term is used to highlight the “entanglement” of feminist and antifeminist ideas, and a sense in which, as <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/mcrobbie-angela-se-3/">Angela McRobbie (2009)</a> has argued, feminism is both “taken for granted” in contemporary culture yet also “repudiated,” as women are offered opportunities for individual success and advancement, on condition that they disavow collective projects for social change. Postfeminism does not simply denote a complicated and contradictory relationship to feminism, but also is constituted through the pervasiveness of neoliberalism in which the enterprise form is extended to all forms of conduct and “normatively constructs and interpellates individuals as entrepreneurial actors in every sphere of life” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/brown-wendy/">Brown 2005, 42</a>). It appears that women to a greater extent than men are constituted as active, autonomous, and self-reinventing subjects, called on to “make over” their selves again and again.</p>
<p>Indeed, makeover is a central theme of postfeminism—seen not just in the hostile scrutiny of women’s bodies on shows such as <em>10 Years Younger </em>or <em>The Swan</em>, but more broadly regarded as a central part of a neoliberal disciplinary apparatus (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/heller-dana/">Heller 2007</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/ouellette-laurie-and-james-hay/">Ouellette and Hay 2008</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/ringrose-jessica-and-valerie-walkerdine/">Ringrose and Walkerdine 2008</a>). It has been argued that this makeover paradigm increasingly moves beyond homes, gardens, bodies, and intimate relations, but now calls forth a transformation of subjectivity itself, a central element of what elsewhere I have called the psychic life of postfeminism. One clear example of this is in the contemporary incitements to confidence (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/banet-weiser-sarah-se-2/">Banet-Weiser 2015</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/gill-rosalind-and-shani-orgad/">Gill and Orgad 2015</a>) in which women are exhorted to “lean in” and become more confident and involved at work (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/sandberg-sheryl/">Sandberg 2013</a>), to “love your body” (by brands like Dove, Gap, and Weight Watchers), and to believe that “confidence is the new sexy” (Bobbi Brown). <em>Elle </em>magazine had a Confidence Issue in 2015, and even the Girl Guiding Association now offers a badge in “body confidence”—one indication of the force and reach of this postfeminist imperative.</p>
<p>Postfeminism has proved a valuable and productive lens for exploring contemporary mediations of gender. The term is contested—referring to historical, epistemological, and backlash versions. One productive and much-used formulation regards it as a cultural sensibility that should be the object of critical interest—rather than a position or a perspective. Elements of this sensibility seen across media culture include the notion of gender as grounded in the body, and with an intensified focus on women’s appearance; the shift from objectification to subjectification as a mode of representing women; an increased emphasis upon self-surveillance, -monitoring, and -discipline; a focus upon individualism, choice, and empowerment as the “watchwords” of postfeminism; a resurgence in ideas of natural sexual difference; and an emphasis upon consumerism and the commodification of difference (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/gill-rosalind-se/">Gill 2007b</a>). These elements coexist with and are structured by stark and continuing inequalities and exclusions that relate to “race” and ethnicity, class, age, sexuality, and disability. The contemporary foci on postfeminism, neoliberalism, and subjectivity offer challenging and exciting directions for new work on gender and media.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Identity is an intriguing concept with a plurality of applications and meanings that make it attractive but also contested. Associated with questions such as “Who am I?” all the way to “Would I sacrifice for my community?” identity reflects multiple associations and dissociations, including, while not limited to, ethnicity, nationality, social class, gender, sexuality, and religion. One of the most influential concepts across social sciences and the humanities, identity has particular resonance to media and communications, especially as it raises important questions about media power: Is identity reflected or shaped in the media? What are the implications of media representations for different groups and their identities? Do media enhance understanding or hatred toward others? These questions have enduring relevance, but answering them has become increasingly complex, especially as media diversify, exposure to proximate and distant others expands, and digital connections—asymmetrically but effectively—manage spaces of belonging within and across physical boundaries.</p>
<p>A concept that is malleable, identity is used in academia, as much as it is used in everyday and political contexts. In everyday life, it primarily relates to the presentation of the self to others: identity is no less than an ordinary performance, Erving Goffman argues (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/goffman-erving/">1969</a>). The ways people dress in public or present themselves in social media are about performing identity and finding ways to locate the self(-identity) in the world (social identity) through acts that are socially recognized as carrying certain meanings. Thus identity is as much about self-making as it about the position individuals take in social systems. As Paul Gilroy puts it, there is a constant “interplay between our subjective experience of the world and the cultural and historical settings in which that fragile subjectivity is formed” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/gilroy-paul/">1997, 301</a>). This dialectic becomes most evident when identity is mobilized to support political claims, or even to justify violence. Propaganda radio broadcasts in Nazi Germany and during the Rwandan genocide projected the “purity” of German and Hutu identities respectively against “impure” and “inferior” identities of the Other (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/appadurai-arjun-se-2/">Appadurai 2006</a>). Either in responding to or in shaping powerful narratives of identity, propaganda radio did in the twentieth century what extremist websites do at present: symbolically mark identity and difference through powerful mediated discourses and imagery.</p>
<p>As these examples reveal, the relationship between identity construction and media and communications is long-standing and prominent. Many argue that this relationship’s significance has grown in time, not least as opportunities for identification with communities (e.g., fans), places (e.g., cities), and cultures (e.g., celebrities) have multiplied due to the digital expansion of media technological affordances and representations. This claim gains more validity especially if we examine it in relation to three key macro-processes associated with the organization of contemporary social and cultural life: globalization, migration, and mediation. Each of these macro-processes has implications for identity, some of which are captured by three concepts that have gained eminence in analyses of identity and in relation to these macro-processes: reflexivity, hybridity, and performativity. Not unlike the concept of identity itself, these concepts—which can also be considered as conditions of identity formation—have wider and global relevance, though their particular meanings are always contextual and particular. As Stuart Hall puts it, identities “are subject to the continuous ‘play’ of history, culture and power” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/hall-stuart-se-3/">1990, 223</a>). Thus, questions of identity are best understood at the juncture of macro-processes that make history and society and the distinct and particular micro-processes of everyday life—what in social sciences is vividly captured through the debate of structure (given norms and limits) versus agency (individual capacity to make choices).</p>
<p>Debates on the relation between structure and agency raise critical questions: How much control do individuals have over their own identities? How reflexive and aware are they of their choices? <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/giddens-anthony/">Anthony Giddens (1991)</a> responds to the binary opposition of “structure versus agency” by proposing their dialectic interdependence. Identity matters and involves a process of <em>reflexivity</em>: individuals make decisions based on their awareness of norms and boundaries and while mobilizing their capacity to negotiate and even resist such structural boundaries and norms (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/giddens-anthony/">Giddens 1991</a>). Audience research has supported such arguments. David Morley’s now classic study of <em>The Nationwide Audience </em>(<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/morley-david/">1980</a>) demonstrates that class identities were central to interpretation of television programming, while more recent research emphasizes the role of gender, ethnic, and national identities in negotiating media norms and values (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/georgiou-myria/">Georgiou 2006</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/nightingale-virginia-ed/">Nightingale 2014</a>). These discussions also recognize that individuals’ and groups’ reflexive engagement with the media has grown in complexity at global times.</p>
<p>Globalization has challenged traditional societies, not least through the faster and wider circulation of information on different cultures, subcultures, and value systems. The more information becomes available to people about the particularity of their own identity visà-vis the range of other identities and experiences in the world, the more identity turns into a reflexive but also fragile project. Media constantly show their users that very little can be taken for granted as universal truths or as globally accepted norms—family life, work cultures, and lifestyles vary, and all this diversity is regularly visible to them. Identity of one’s own and of others is constantly under scrutiny, even under threat, especially as media remind their audiences of risks, such as terrorism, close by and at a distance, and of others’ constant presence on screens (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/silverstone-roger-se/">Silverstone 2007</a>) and on the street, especially as a result of migration.</p>
<p>Yet, access to information and communication remains uneven—not everyone sees themselves and others in the media to the same extent. Unequal access to media and communications and uneven representations of different groups, especially on the basis of race, gender, sexuality, class, and location, can privilege certain groups against others. Returning to the questions of whether individuals have control over their own identities and if identities represent a global reflexive project, one might need to consider whether media power and control are directly involved in producing identity hierarchies. This question becomes even more important if we approach identities as symbolically constructed. <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/mead-george/">Mead (1934)</a> argued that different symbols allow individuals to imagine how others see them and act selfconsciously in response to that. Such symbols can be a passport or a language that represent nationality, but they can expand across a range of identifiable or subtle representations, such as media representations. Does it matter that ethnic minorities are underrepresented on national television in most countries of the Global North? Does it matter that stereotypical images of femininity are reproduced across different media? And does it matter that Internet access between continents varies enormously with both technological and content control overconcentrated in the Global North? Feminist and postcolonial scholars (see <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/gill-rosalind/">Gill 2007a</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/hegde-radha-se/">Hegde 2016</a>) have emphasized the role of the media in constructing, not just representing, identities; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/de-lauretis-teresa/">Teresa de Lauretis (1989)</a> powerfully argued that cinema is a technology of gender, that media representations <em>are </em>the constructions of gender, class, race, not just their reflection. While media and communication scholars widely recognize these challenges, their responses vary. Some emphasize the significance of fairer and regulated representations of diversity in mainstream media as a necessity for different groups gaining recognition and respect for their cultural identities and difference (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/downing-john-and-charles-husband/">Downing and Husband 2005</a>). Others argue that digital media have changed the game altogether by diversifying identity representations; increasingly media users become producers of their own desired representations of the self and of their communities (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/bruns-axel/">Bruns 2007</a>).</p>
<p>Discussions on participatory and reflexive engagement with the media have gone hand in hand with debates on the fragmentation, multiplicity, and <em>hybridity </em>of identities. Digital technologies have boosted mediated mobility between spaces, but migration has enhanced physical mobility and identification with a range of collectivities and communities for much longer. A core element of global change, intensified and diversified migration has presented a range of challenges to the concept of identity, not least as this has historically been associated with the nation and bounded communities. Influentially, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/anderson-benedict/">Benedict Anderson’s (1991)</a> theorization of imagined communities established the close relation between the nation and the media throughout modernity. Sharing the same news and the same media within the boundaries of the nation has reproduced shared imagination of collective identities among people willing to commit and even die for the nation, he argues. Currently one in thirty-three people is an international migrant (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/united-nations-population-fund/">United Nations Population Fund 2015</a>), while more than half of the world’s population lives in cities, largely as a result of mass migration. Do national media still have the power to widely and effectively circulate symbols of a community? Or do current formulations of media and culture destabilize identities that used to be dominant, like national identities, but even social class, gender, and religion?</p>
<p>A range of approaches respond critically to these questions, especially by problematizing the limits, relevance, and biases of the concept of identity. <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/robins-kevin/">Kevin Robins (2001)</a> talks against identity altogether, arguing that as a concept it has become irrelevant to the experience and imagination of people who live between different physical and mediated environments. <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/ang-ien-se-2/">Ien Ang (2003)</a> recognizes the value of identity, especially in recognition of its mobilization for political projects of emancipation, as seen in the case of indigenous and ethnic minority movements. At the same time, she highlights the dangerous territory of identity, as it is sometimes mobilized within national and transnational communities to promote hostility to difference and to diversity. In response, she turns to hybridity as a concept helpful to understanding “a world where we no longer have the secure capacity to draw a line between us and them, the different and the same, here and there, and indeed between ‘Asian’ and ‘Western’” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/ang-ien-se-2/">2003, 141</a>). Hybridity has become an attractive concept, especially in critical approaches to identity, as it opens up a space for understanding and promoting togetherness-in-difference rather than being preoccupied with identity’s separateness (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/ang-ien-se-2/">Ang 2003</a>). Is the binary of togetherness/separation the inevitable result of a politics of identity, or is there space for a politics that recognizes both difference and commonality? W. E. B. Du Bois’s concept of “double consciousness” speaks of a “two-ness,” of feeling “an American, a Negro” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/du-bois-w/">1903/1986, 364</a>), a line of thought followed by <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/gilroy-paul/">Gilroy’s (1997)</a> conceptualization of the “changing same” in regard to diasporic identities’ multiplicity and ambivalent perspectives. Continuity comes with change and identifications with new places and people. Urban music often reflects such hybrid, complex, and ambivalent systems of identification (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/georgiou-myria-se/">Georgiou 2013</a>): R&amp;B and hip-hop lyrics and musical themes sometimes capture experiences and histories of migration and diaspora, while at the same time identifying struggles firmly grounded in urban, marginalized locales.</p>
<p>Music, graffiti, advertising, as well as social media currently constitute elements of mediated communication, as much as the press, television, and radio. Thus, information and symbols of identity—from world news to “likes”—are circulated widely through a range of networks including those controlled by media conglomerates, but also by communities, such as music fans, diasporas, and extremist groups. As a result and inevitably, debates on the inclusion and exclusion of different groups from media production and representation have now expanded far beyond mass media. Who speaks and on behalf of whom and with what consequences for identity is a question requiring more complex responses than in the past. Arguably, media power has grown, not least as all different elements of communication—interpersonal, community, professional, local, and transnational—are increasingly mediated. <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/silverstone-roger-se/">Roger Silverstone (2007)</a> argues that mediation comes with significant changes in social and cultural environments and regulates relations between individuals, groups, and institutions. The diversification but also the ever presence of media in everyday life open up prospects for more democratic and diverse recognition of identities and difference, argue some; yet others emphasize the danger for further regulation and containment of identity—theories of <em>performativity </em>have been influential to both claims.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/butler-judith/">Judith Butler (1990)</a>, identity is more about what you <em>do </em>rather than about what you <em>are</em>. Identity is a regulatory fiction, she argues, reinforcing limits and control upon individuals. Following Michel Foucault, Butler argues that gender, like all identities, is the result of repeated performances “that congeal over time to produce the appearance of substance, of a natural sort of being” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/butler-judith/">1990, 33</a>). Inscriptions of identity are reproduced through the repetition of certain symbols, not least through media representations. If media’s influence in culture and society is growing, as mediation scholars claim, then important questions are raised in regard to the mediated reproduction of identity hierarchies— such as heterosexuality versus homosexuality, whiteness versus blackness, West versus East. Scholars who criticize the growing commercialization of the Internet (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/mejias-ulises/">Mejias 2013</a>) express concerns about digital media reinforcing the status quo and current political and cultural hierarchies. Yet, others turn to performativity to emphasize the possibility for resistance to such hierarchies in digital media (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/cammaerts-bart/">Cammaerts 2012</a>). If identity is not natural, as claimed by Butler but also by most contemporary identity theorists, there is always a possibility for resistance to its inscribed substance—this is for example seen in the case of transgender identities that destabilize the binary man/woman and reveal that all identities are performed. When it comes to the media in particular, performative complexity becomes most visible in social media: for example, in cross-gender screen identities or, more importantly, in digital projects of self-making that challenge limits of identity. Onscreen performances and confessional narratives that appear on YouTube and blogs are powerful reflections of experimental articulations of the self and provide evidence of the continuous appeal of communities, though and importantly, not only of communities of origin but also of choice. Digital environments can be seen as providing the evidence of shifting spaces of identity. Yet they can be more than that: they can both reflect and construct identity in its performative and imagined dimensions. Most importantly, digital media, like all media, reveal the relevance of identity as a concept used to understand but also to express claims to recognition, as a category of emotional but also political significance that captures and reveals the always incomplete struggles of individuals and groups for a place in the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In its most common uses, the term “labor” refers to either an organized system of exploitation or a personal source of pleasure. “Slave labor” relies on unfree populations forced into servitude, while a “labor of love” is a gift that an individual freely gives. These two usages are frequently conjoined, conflated, or compared to simply “work.” The orthodoxies that insist on using the word “labor” over “work” are less important than ways in which the word is deployed in these seemingly contradictory ways to explain centuries of media production and their producers.</p>
<p>On the one hand, media labor refers to a human productive capacity. The ability to communicate, while universal to all, has a special aura in relation to media industries and their specialized technologies. Beyond simply the application of skills, media labor implies a process of self-actualization for workers to construct particular kinds of identities in society (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/mayer-vicki/">Mayer 2011</a>). Media labor typically requires collaboration, even if remotely, and thus places individuals within social networks that are frequently further defined by gender, race, nationality, and social class. At the base of these definitions of media labor is the understanding that symbolic production as communication is both different from all other sorts of human creations, and that the laborer communicates to others without necessarily expecting money or other compensation. This definition is rooted in the biblical language of the “labor of love” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/hyde-lewis/">Hyde 1983</a>), and though it can easily slide into romantic notions of media labor, it also expresses what separates communication (a song) from other material processes (pressing the record) (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/hesmondhalgh-david-and-sarah-baker/">Hesmondhalgh and Baker 2011</a>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, media labor implies the conditioning of one’s unique capacities within a social structure. In Marxist terms, the power of the media worker is traded for economic benefits such as wages. In liberal democracies, the nation-state supports these laborers to negotiate fair remuneration for their time and efforts in exchange for more tax revenues. Capitalism, however, acts as a social force to reduce the value of the labor to achieve the highest profit margins. This frequently means dividing media laborers according to occupational roles within and across various codependent industries (i.e., electronics manufacturing versus information processing versus video game design), and then conquering laborers’ abilities to self-organize through unions or other types of association. Under these conditions that create downward competition and stave off solidarities, it’s no wonder that media labor infers exploitation as much as actualization.</p>
<p>Labor as actualization and exploitation was already in play during the first media revolution. As <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/eisenstein-elizabeth-l/">Elizabeth Eisenstein (1983)</a> charts, the rise of the printing press from 1450 to 1600 transformed not only media labor markets, but also the social value of printing as a special kind of labor across Europe. The painstaking process of reproducing books by hand, aka manuscripts, required increasingly skilled workers to cluster nearby to more efficiently reproduce figures, charts, and a new scientific lexicon. The earliest printers contracted experienced freelance stationers, along with a wide array of binders, rubricators, and calligraphers from the scriptoria. New trades developed. A new division of labor and press technologies freed printers to focus on the contents of their books, permitting creative experimentation and new inventions, such as footnotes, tables of contents, and cross-references. Laborers came from different social worlds and traveled extensively to market both their skills and their book lists. They often made collective decisions about the product while competing against other presses.</p>
<p>Laborers shared the same production and reception culture in large towns across Western Europe. Print shops became cultural centers for the growth of a cosmopolitan literati and learning communities that lured university students from lectures. Predating Wikipedia, these early media laborers had a hand in creating and re-creating books through editing, translation, and even scientific experimentation to test texts’ veracity. Some even developed free-labor networks of readercorrespondents to help correct errors for subsequent editions. Printers expressed their identities though their own libraries as testaments to the “by-products of their own shop work” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/eisenstein-elizabeth-l/">Eisenstein 1983, 49</a>).</p>
<p>As the printers came to be known for their book lists rather than their richest readers, the master printer came to be the first celebrity of the age. Estienne made Latin Bibles. Ortelius made atlases. The famous master printer of Mainz, Peter Schoeffer, was known for developing indexes and new editions as sales techniques. He was also infamous for his testimony against Gutenberg, sending his business partner into exile. The master printer bridged social and cultural worlds, heading complex organizations by securing the financial resources to wholesale niche goods to yet-unknown markets. They were the ultimate multitaskers, taking on the roles of publisher, seller, indexer, translator, and editor, among others. They curried favor with officials and the guilds they needed for materials and resources. They mentored their own assistants and cultivated their own talent, especially authors and artists who would attract loyal buyers. In sum, they were self-promoters and entrepreneurs par excellence, becoming socially prominent as their goods were associated with their personae throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, printers erased the names of the workers who created the volumes under them. Master printers looked to new financial syndicates to provide labor and avoid the potential for strikes. They asserted the first claims over copyright and piracy to protect their profits over authors, competitors, and all other media laborers. With time, even the most creative personnel, such as illustrators, found they were replaceable to improved machinery. Printers’ power concentrated with slimmer and cheaper staffs. Ironically, printers and their publishing kin would look upon their media labor as a craft, even as they continually standardized its processes and harnessed labor power. The history of printing reveals that even as some laborers achieve status or celebrity as printers, the print industry renders far more laborers as an exploitable, and ultimately disposable, commodity.</p>
<p>Media labor is still a commodity to be leveraged against other materials and resources needed in operating an industry. Printers’ social status in the Western world declined in relation to the growth of new automated technologies. In general, new workplace technologies have exerted the most pressure on the middle range of laborers across media industries. “Deskilling” refers to the process by which media laborers’ skills have been mechanized, and thus are no longer valuable in the negotiation of labor contracts (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/braverman-harry/">Braverman 1974</a>). The low status of assistants as support staff, as opposed to guild mentees, for higher-ranked media laborers was one outcome of deskilling. Another outcome has been the expansion of work duties among media laborers more generally as they are expected to do more of the tasks once assigned to others. Media labor typically involves a range of technological practices associated with time and duty management, financial and social accounting, and communication with a wider range of people outside of the workplace, such as clients, consumers, and audiences.</p>
<p>As automation has tended to homogenize the workforce in terms of their unique capabilities, the very definition of media labor has expanded to capture the symbolic, emotional, and communicative tasks involved in being part of an increasingly postindustrial workforce. This immaterial labor extends beyond the waged time and space of the traditional notion of the workplace and into the home as a “social factory” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/scholz-trebor/">Scholz 2013</a>). Media laborers cultivate themselves as particular kinds of workers. Described in the present moment as selfbranding, immaterial media labor assists in the reproduction of media labor both in terms of individuals’ career portfolios and in terms of the social reproduction of jobs that are highly segregated by gender, ethnicity or race, and sexuality: from the white masculine world of high-tech hackers (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/coleman-gabriella/">Coleman 2012</a>) to the feminine heteronormative world of fashion bloggers (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/duffy-brooke/">Duffy 2013</a>). In their most commodified articulations, media labor markets transform people into tradable objects. High-status star or celebrity identities operate as properties that can be managed by teams of workers, while low-status ordinary citizens give their personal data freely every time they surf the Internet.</p>
<p>Within these general trends, it is important to understand the ways national policies and regulations structure different kinds of media labor. The public service framework for broadcasting across most of the world, with the United States as an outlier, has meant that media laborers’ ethical codes include some commitment to the noble goal of serving the “public good” even if only as an ideal. At the same time, the incursion of commercial competition globally in this industry, assisted by deregulation, as well as the expansion of new digital platforms for broadcast content have forced public service workers to achieve more in a highly competitive setting. The lowering of protective barriers in international trade also spurred the offshoring of media work previously thought to be nationally based, such as copyediting in publishing or computer graphic artistry in visual effects industries. The popular notion of a “flexible” labor force most notably occurred during the government breakup of the Hollywood studio system in the 1960s. Producers learned to shed their financial risks by outsourcing virtually all of their in-house production staffs to independent contractors (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/christopherson-susan-and-michael-storper/">Christopherson and Storper 1989</a>). Subsequently, the film as well as virtually all other audiovisual and digital media industries convene their laborers together solely for the duration of a single project. Under contract laws, work-for-hire laborers sacrifice job stability, benefits, and all rights associated with their creations. Similarly, weakened labor laws have spurred the boom in freelance and internship markets in order to increase the flexibility of employers. Writers, photographers, designers, and a whole range of workers involved in digital techniques and applications now act as their own employers in taking responsibility for their own welfare and job safety. Although very few media laborers work solitarily to create a product or content, the national legal structuring of employment may render some media labor forces atomized both physically and politically.</p>
<p>Media laborers have had to cultivate strong external social networks to stave off the feast-or-famine cycles now associated with short-term, project-based, and oncall jobs. These networks have supported some labor organizing across industries and nations, such as the Freelancers Union and the International Game Developers Association, but these formations can be fragile, and even undermined by governmental interference, industry co-optation, and internal gatekeepers. More tactical approaches have prevailed to promote diversity within media production cultures or to develop ethical codes, not just to safeguard membership in the labor force, but to share resources and encourage mutual solidarity. Web designers, for example, developed collective standards for ensuring the accessibility of their sites to users with disabilities (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/kennedy-helen/">Kennedy 2012</a>).</p>
<p>Although mass media industries typically promote the visibility of those workers located at the tops of their own organizational hierarchies—the director/producer, the publisher, the mogul—the vast majority of media labor is invisible—a term with multiple connotations. In most cases, media labor is invisible to those who consume its products. Gamers, for example, sustain an illegal labor force of “gold farmers” who are forced to play online in the developing world to help players in the developed world buy virtual goods or achieve game levels. More generally, data and information jobs dominate all stages of media production today. Yet the public is still largely unaware of the scope and scale of media workers dedicated to big data capture, collection, and curation. Media labor thus frequently involves not only those workers who are not found in a media spotlight, but also the invisible “free labor” of the public writ large who contributes their data to media production processes (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/terranova-tiziana-se/">Terranova 2004</a>).</p>
<p>Similarly, much of media labor is invisible to employers and the state because it involves tasks or skills that are never remunerated or part of a wage structure. This invisible media labor tends to coincide precisely with voluntary practices or labors of love that drive people toward their jobs in the first place. Historically, the responsibility of most immaterial labor fell to women who fell outside of formal employment markets (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/fortunati-leopoldina/">Fortunati 1995</a>). This legacy has functioned to “feminize” certain media labor tasks, which then are assumed to not be as valuable as other achieved skills or credentials, and even stratify some media labor markets by the gender presumed best suited for the invisible requirements of their jobs (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/mayer-vicki/">Mayer 2011</a>). Invisible media labor in this sense can result in the unequal treatment and payment of workers who participate equally in media production processes, but whose labor is valued according to different cultural standards.</p>
<p>Finally, media labor is often invisible to fellow media laborers. The neologism “precariat” speaks to the precarious working conditions that connect the majority of media laborers with those across other sectors of the global economy. These conditions hinder the formation of a broader media labor movement, much less the formation of a working class in and for itself—“the proletariat.” This notion of invisibility has political connotations for the future of media labor. The formation of syndicates, unions, guilds, and other professional associations relies on the mutual recognition of their members as media laborers. From there the solidarity of media labor may make itself not only visible, but powerful in shaping the balance between labor as a means of exploitation or actualization.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Queer media is an emergent category acknowledging that media forms, from film and television to an ever expanding digital sphere, are no longer just “playing to Peoria” (and the many Peorias since established) as the standard of demographic normalcy and desirability. The early 2000s saw the emergence of LGBTQ-focused programming on cable networks like Logo, and gave rise to Bravo as the unofficial home for queer programming ever since it turned queer eyes to straight guys. More recently, queer methods for storytelling have come to prominence on streaming platforms like Amazon and Netflix (which launched queer shows like <em>Transparent</em>), and social media sites like YouTube and Instagram, which provide platforms for queer and transgender people to auto-document their lives, struggles, and transitions. In short, queer niches have sprouted up across the media landscape since the beginning of the new millennium, even as LGBTQ characters have become more prevalent on prime-time network programming—ABC’s sitcom <em>Modern Family </em>the most frequently cited among them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Queer media also function as a historical index: as a phrase that encompasses, in shorthand, the medial transformations and shifts that afford such proximity with the “queer,” and the cultural and conceptual changes queer life, culture, and theory have inaugurated in the United States and beyond (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/villarejo-amy/">Villarejo 2014</a>). In other words, we have become more attentive to the ways in which media themselves have been transformed at various historical moments by the advances of, and irruptions caused by, LGBTQ civil rights movements and calls for political and cultural representation. Scripted television “after <em>Ellen</em>,” DeGeneres’s herstorical coming out in “The Puppy Episode” in 1997, and the proliferation of queer participation on reality television, with its roots in PBS’s 1973 series <em>An American Family</em>, are owed in many respects to the historical agitations and transformations that precipitated these moments of visibility (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/villarejo-amy/">Villarejo 2014, 92</a>).</p>
<p>“Queer media” also names a set of practices and methods for interpreting media that may or may <em>not </em>make themselves available to queer interpretation, queer worlds, and queer people—as innovators in the field of feminist, LGBTQ media studies have explored for over two decades (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/doty-alexander/">Doty 1993</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/joyrich-lynne/">Joyrich 1996</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/modleski-tania-se/">Modleski 2007</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/rich-b/">Rich 2013</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/white-patricia/">White 1999</a>). With a contemporary media landscape relatively rich in queer representation— from <em>Orange Is the New Black </em>to <em>I Am Cait </em>to “Same Love,” the rapper Macklemore’s top-forty hit advocating for gay marriage, to mainstream movies depicting lesbian marriage between All-American sweethearts (<em>Jenny’s </em><em>Wedding</em>, 2015)—it would seem that queer viewers are no longer bereft of the opportunity to see ourselves on screens and devices large, small, fixed, and portable.</p>
<p>How and why, then, do arguments about queer visibility still run the table? For example, why are we obsessed with the lack of butch lesbians in film and TV (one of Jack Halberstam’s recurrent concerns on his collaborative scholarly blog, <em>Bully Bloggers</em>), at the same time we capitulate to the latest BuzzFeed hype about the openly queer, masculine of center celesbian DJ, supermodel, and actress Ruby Rose, not to mention the many would-be Ruby Roses clamoring to reboot “lesbian chic” on social media platforms like Instagram? Why amid such apparent abundance, are we still left feeling so empty? Furthermore, why in this economy of plentitude are we still struggling to describe what is queer about media, and how media themselves might be queer? These definitional problems arise in part because the category of “queer” and what exactly it indexes have always been up for debate in the academy and beyond. At times “queer” has come to mean a particular set of sexual practices, positions, and proclivities. In the past fifteen years or so, scholars have vigorously debated whether or not queer constitutes <em>any </em>form of antinormativity. Meanwhile, some of the field’s fundamental questions continue to abide: Is queer an identity? An orientation? A method? A practice of reading, seeing, or hearing?</p>
<p>Aren’t-we-GLAAD approaches to quantifying queer visibility—that is, measuring with exactness how many gay characters, shows, and actors are on TV or in films, and whether or not these portrayals are positive or negative—have created their own set of limitations around our encounters with <em>all </em>forms of media, not just explicitly queer representations with identifiable queer bodies, characters and “acts.” Like the Dickensian Mr. Gradgrind, the headmaster in <em>Hard Times </em>obsessed with numbers and their Malthusian applicability to a profitdriven “greater good,” queer media observers are inevitably derailed by counting how many LGBTQ shows are watched by larger audiences, and measuring their “impact” in ways that equate profit and advertiser approval with political progress. As an alternative to these metrics of quantification, and in the effort to bring back some of the vicissitudes the murky designation of “queerness” affords, we might rediscover queer media, past and present, as sites of fantasy, play, and projection.</p>
<p>In other words, we are so fixated on how <em>many</em>, how <em>often</em>, and how <em>affirmative </em>portrayals are that we have begun to lose sight and sound of the textures, sensations, and idiosyncrasies that fuel the pleasure of queer spectatorship and participation (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/belcher-christina/">Belcher 2014</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/moore-candace/">Moore 2013</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/rhee-margaret-and-amanda-phillips/">Rhee and Phillips 2015</a>). To invoke Kara Keeling’s more expansive medial perspective, we are in a moment during which we have the potential to craft the architecture for a “Queer OS” (operating system). As Keeling writes, “Queer OS names a way of thinking and acting with, about, through, among, and at times even in spite of new media technologies and other phenomena of mediation. It insists upon forging and facilitating uncommon, irrational, imaginative, and/or unpredictable relationships between and among what currently are perceptible as living beings and the environment in the interest of creating value(s) that facilitate just relations” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/keeling-kara-se/">2014, 154</a>). I’m interested in Keeling’s insistence on the “thinking and acting <em>with</em>.” Queer media, in other words, is as much about a queer engagement, and sometimes <em>resistance </em>to certain processes of representation and mediation in the effort to forge an otherwise, and a “not yet” (to echo the language of José Esteban Muñoz’s <em>Cruising Utopia</em>): a striving for alternate and just relationalities or “different paths to queerness” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/munoz-jose-esteban-se/">2009, 15</a>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, queer is anchored never simply to a set of bodies or practices, but more crucially to a set of methods and <em>desires</em>—both political and intellectual— derived from activist genealogies (e.g., the legacy of Queer Nation), the academy (since the institutionalization of queer studies starting in the 1990s), and media forms themselves. As I argued elsewhere, “Though we may have loved, fucked, eaten, sang, sewn, played softball, honked the tuba, ballet danced, taken ecstasy, and flashed jazz hands, queerly in our lifetimes before our respective sojourns in higher education, we talk, write, read, watch publish essays and books, waste our time making GIFs about, and sit in harshly lit MLA ballrooms to mull over the queer we learned in school” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/tongson-karen/">Tongson 2014, 118</a>). Extending my claims about the affinities, and the formal, as well as everyday pedagogies constituting “queerness,” to media engagement, I would also like to imagine that queer spectatorship—particularly televisuality and the proliferating forms of “home-viewing” in which we participate—is also born of another kind of sensibility: a “latchkey” sensibility that we often equate with the voracious overconsumption of media that forges our queer sensibilities. I would argue, for example, that the figure we have come to know as the “latchkey kid” is the linchpin to illuminating queer media and queer relationships to media: she is the figure left to her own devices who forges improper identifications, and—to invoke Muñoz’s work once more—dangerous disidentifications (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/munoz-jose-esteban/">1999</a>) with media content, appropriate or inappropriate. Through the historical, metaphorical figure of the latchkey kid, we can trace a particular kind of queer relationship to media born of excess and dereliction, one in which the queer spectators project themselves into worlds beyond the ones that have chosen to ignore them.</p>
<p>Historically, the “latchkey kid” is among the first prototypical consumers (some would say over-consumers) of media, who cannot be imagined as a producer of any kind. Unsupervised, left alone, and either fearful or bored, the youth of suburbia have been called latchkey kids since World War II, when the label was invented to describe children transiently orphaned by work as well as war. In 1944, Henry L. Zucker, secretary of the Emergency Child Care Committee of Cleveland, and an advisory committee member of the Child Welfare League of America, lamented the term’s induction into the “social work literature” of the era: “The nomenclature of social work literature has been enriched during the war by such terms as ‘latchkey’ or ‘doorkey’ children and ‘eight hour orphans.’ . . . The house key tied around the neck is the symbol of cold meals, of a child neglected and shorn of the security of a mother’s love and affection. These new terms foretell a war-bred generation of problem adolescents-to-be in the 1950s, and of maladjusted parents-to-be in the 1960s” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/zucker-henry-l/">Zucker 1944, 43</a>).</p>
<p>Even before the concept of a nuclear family cohered in the atomic age after World War II—an age that bore witness to America’s storied baby boom, its rapid suburbanization, and the rise of television—social workers were concerned with the dissolution of the family unit, because of the shifting gender roles wrought by war. With more women in the workforce, as men fought overseas in the European and Pacific theaters, children were increasingly left to seek refuge with neighbors or “aged grandparents,” or worse, according to social observers, to fend for themselves. Quoting extensively from a female elementary school principal’s report on her school’s “war casualties,” Zucker argued that the excessive consumption of media had a deleterious effect upon a child’s unsupervised time:</p>
<blockquote><p>Edward, a bright child but extremely nervous, could not sit still or remain in his seat long enough to do his work. Both parents were working, both were extremely tired and nervous. . . . One Monday, things became so extremely bad in the classroom that the teacher asked Edward what he had done. Well, the mother had given him $2.00 to do what he wanted. He left home at ten o’clock, went to a movie at the Hippodrome, then one at the Palace, one at the Mall, then one at the neighborhood theater, arriving home at ten o’clock [pm], tired but feeling that he had had a most successful day. (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/zucker-henry-l/">Zucker 1944, 47</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Even before broadcast television became a staple of every middle-class home, and binge watching and #showholes (a recent ad campaign encouraging binge viewing through the Amazon Fire platform) entered popular parlance in the streaming era, Edward, the insatiable consumer of entertainment, proved how delinquency, truancy, and disrespect for institutions and authority are fostered by “the wrong” relationship to media.</p>
<p>Thus the queer viewer has always, already been something of a latchkey viewer. Our entry points to media are often askew, and require a certain overindulgence and excessiveness. The latchkey queer is the one who, like Jonathan Caouette in his homemade, indie feature <em>Tarnation </em>(2003), or performance artist Kalup Linzy in his sumptuous, if low-tech, fannish soap opera performance videos (2002–6), transposes isolate, sometimes lonely queer viewing practices of mainstream programming, from prime-time drama to daytime fare like <em>Guiding Light</em>, into the texture of another life, another story, another medium. Caouette turned his latchkey overconsumption of prime-time soaps, documented autoethnographically on video throughout his adolescence, into the content and texture for a feature film later he made as an adult using iMovie. Linzy does similar work with his performance videos, albeit through dramatic reenactments of his and other queers of color’s reception of soapy daytime fare. Like latchkey kids who had to fend for themselves and fight for their sustenance, these queer artists reheated what was processed and packaged and turned it into something nourishing. Latchkey queers are the dykes who, like the members of the 1990s punk band Team Dresch, accidentally happened upon Mariel Hemingway and Patrice Donnelly achieving their <em>Personal Best </em>(1982) on an endless cycle of regular cable repeats of the sporty film in the afternoon, opening pathways to becoming fantastical new beings à la “Fagetarian and Dyke” on their 1995 album <em>Personal Best</em>—an oblique musical homage to the film.</p>
<p>The objects may continue to change. Instead of glistening lady track stars perspiring in slow motion after their athletic exertions, we may now turn to butch lesbian-identified Top Chefs sporting all iterations of the faux hawk while thrusting their “hands up, and utensils down” upon Padma Lakshmi’s command. Instead of Harry Hamlin “making love” with both Michael Ontkean <em>and </em>Kate Jackson as he did as a confused bisexual man in the film <em>Making Love </em>from 1982, we may take a prurient queer pleasure in the overcooked heterodisaster-kink of a cable series like <em>The Affair </em>(2015–), or the slow-burning normporn of a show like NBC’s <em>Parenthood </em>(2010–15), or the adoptive parental homonormporn of <em>The Fosters </em>(2013–) (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/tongson-karen-se/">Tongson 2015</a>). Queer media have meant, and continue to mean to me, the sort of titillated, interpellated, yet ultimately ambivalent viewing practices, that re-enliven the reparative, and disidentificatory practices of queer fantasy—the kind of imagining that carries the potential for queer world making. To watch and listen queerly also mean to explore the ambivalent pleasures, and the attraction-repulsion queer viewers experience when watching even the most mainstream, ready-forprime-time network programming designed for families, modern or not. These moments of queer encounter with and <em>within </em>media, with or without actual queer bodies, created the conditions of possibility for—continue to create the possibility for—righteous and radiant queer operating systems, platforms, fantasies, or what we still dare to call “worlds,” from yesterday to today; for tomorrow, forever, or perhaps even never, IRL—in real life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Race is a legal, social, and cultural invention rather than given in nature, and the knowledge of race and its deployment are <em>exercises of power </em>expressed in the encounter among groups for control over resources. The social construction of race trains our focus on the practices of race, including the terms of its creation, deployment, and enforcement as a mode of group subordination and regulation. Race as a technique of power identifies arbitrary differences such as skin color, hair texture, nose and eye shapes, and thinness of lips as sites of knowledge (classification, hierarchy, and value) about variations in human intelligence, capacity, creativity, development, indeed what it means to be human (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/goldberg-david-t/">Goldberg 2009</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/wynter-sylvia/">Wynter 2003</a>). Constructionism provides an indispensable critical beginning (rather than endpoint) for thinking about the nature of racial knowledge taking shape today.</p>
<p>Nineteenth- and twentieth-century racial projects depended on social and cultural inventions as well as moral rationalizations that made racial difference the basis of classification, value, knowledge, and political practices that enforced racial distinctions by intimidation, violence, and terror. Nineteenth- and twentieth-century decolonial wars, movements for national liberation, and global struggles for civil and legal recognition by people of color around the world <em>ended </em>some of the most brutal, exploitative, and violent racial projects designed to exploit land and labor in order to shore up racial capitalism. By the mid- to late twentieth century, these critical movements produced new subjects of history and knowledge about those subjects produced by those subjects.</p>
<p>Twenty-first-century racial knowledge has taken refuge in the science of the human genome, in the proliferation of cultural diversity and digital technology, and in legal disputes over race-based public policies. Ascendant twenty-first-century truths of race align with different technologies of power, modes of authority, and cultural logics. Knowledge of race ranges across several fronts simultaneously. For example, in the media the truth of race works through the proliferation and hypervisibility of racial difference as multiculturalism while genomic science uses powerful statistical procedures to identify and group populations who share genetic information. Based on statistically identified genetic variations among different populations, genomic scientists of race draw conclusions about racial classification, geographic concentration, and shared ancestry. The changing nature of racial knowledge also includes the recognition of cultural diversity and the incorporation of ethnic studies, queer studies, and feminist studies into university curricula that have become essential components of twenty-first-century knowledge of race (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/ferguson-roderick/">Ferguson 2012</a>). These shifts in racial knowledge invite media, race, and cultural studies scholars to develop new critical analytics to identify, document, and assess the workings of race in the academy, science, law, and media.</p>
<p>I offer aspects of my research on racial projects as a modest illustration. This research traces the mutually constitutive role of media, racial science, and academic knowledge in the assembly of race in the twenty-first-century Global North. Arranged through various racializing practices like racial slavery, colonialism, Jim Crow segregation, and racial neoliberalism, the approach emphasizes the mutual role of representation, meaning, identity, and subjection in such projects. This mutuality stresses differential access by race to resources, forms of state-sanctioned domination (including violence and more benign forms of social terror), and attendant cultural forms and psychological stress for different populations. Racial projects are dynamic exercises of power that produce, organize, and distribute racial and ethnic groupings of populations according to socially valued attributes arranged hierarchically. One might say that race is an outcome, a production of a set of relations and material conditions that take charge of resources necessary for living. Racial projects produce, authorize, circulate, and enforce racial knowledge based on distinction, classification, value, and hierarchy that constitute the discursive truth of race within a given set of living arrangements.</p>
<p>In different historical periods and regions of the globe, racial knowledge designated and denigrated certain populations, targeting them for displacement, land seizure, and captivity for labor exploitation based on purportedly inferior racial attributes. The cultural assignment of value and significance and the social use of classification based on arbitrary racial differences together with scientific explanation and judicial legitimation make such arrangements into racial projects.</p>
<p>Racial projects arrange racial meaning discursively and social practices materially and work by circulating such meanings throughout our commonsense understandings and experiences of everyday life (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/perry-imani/">Perry 2011</a>). Racial projects operate through feelings, emotions, and the body, where we live and feel the truth of race at the most quotidian and commonplace levels. These affective practices focus attention not just on the representational but on the truth of race as intuition and sensation. Meanings and feelings are the locus of legible representation, authoritative knowledge, commonsense understandings, and affective investments in the truth of race.</p>
<p>Indeed, with <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/roberts-dorothy/">Dorothy Roberts (2011)</a>, we might say that race is the expression of the mutually constitutive effects of media, science, the state, and economic markets. The media—the press, commercial broadcast systems, digital platforms, and digital social networks—are scenes where social relations, representations, understandings, and feelings about racial differences among us circulate.</p>
<p>The social relations and the knowledge of race on which they depend vary widely across geographies, histories, and populations in different parts of the world (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/goldberg-david-t/">Goldberg 2009</a>). For instance, South Africa and Brazil, England and the United States culturally recognize racial and ethnic distinction, but differ by state formations, colonial histories, and population removal and displacement; the exploitation and exposure to vulnerability of different segments of the population depend on the assignment by states, elites, and scholars of human capacity based on race. On the basis of such purported capacities, different populations are confined to low-skill, low-wage work, targeted as high credit risks, naturalized as criminal, rendered unemployable, and disproportionately imprisoned.</p>
<p>To claim that we are on the terrain of digital genomic multicultural racial projects is to suggest that because of transformations in digital media, pubic policy, and diversity discourse as well as genomics, race and media have undergone conceptual and practical shifts that make this terrain somewhat distinct from its twentieth-century precursors. With the knowledge of new racial science and digital media capacities, access to gaining cultural representation, visibility, and meaning, in some social arenas, is less open to dispute in the politics of representation today than in the twentieth century, when access relied on the primacy of skin color, hair texture, or nose width as a site of knowledge and truth. Culturally, racial differences are actually celebrated in certain countries in the Global North while in others racial (and ethnic) groups are the targets of intense contestation, regulation, violence, and abjection. In the United States, to take one example, cultural practices in public and private institutions celebrate multiculturalism, while court rulings outlaw race as a basis for allocation of resources or claims to grievance in public life. In this new condition of race making, racial projects produce visibility <em>and </em>regulation, celebration <em>and </em>exploitation.</p>
<p>The post–civil rights conjuncture in the United States that produced the first black American president is not one where there is a paucity of images of racial difference or the cultural grammar to decipher the significance of race. In the Internet age, social media, streaming media services, broadcast, and cable are robust sites of racial engagement, representation, and belonging for all forms of racial and ethnic identifications, thanks in part to the digital technologies that make new media ecologies possible, the political struggles that make the conception of multiculturalism and diversity available, and the genomics research that makes the new science of race possible. Ironically, with the discourse of color blindness and multiculturalism, the United States may be described as one of racial excess (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/fleetwood-nicole-r/">Fleetwood 2011</a>).</p>
<p>As the truth of race moves to the level of the genomic, our cultural celebrations and social suspicions based on race are as visible as ever. In its deployment, circulation, and effect, race organizes, sorts, and informs social life even as claims in science, media, politics, and popular culture insist on the flagging salience of race. So racial projects produce racial knowledge and racial subjects within a condition of abundance and excess where, for example, in the search for one’s racial and ethnic ancestry, the production of race and search for evidence of its scientific truth have gone digital and genomic, where genomic accounts of population variations based on race (among other factors) confirm the importance of racial differences in the authentication of indigenous origins. The market logic of difference based on race (gender, age, and disposable income) arranges popular knowledge as the footing for identification and belonging and consumption on the basis of race as a lifestyle choice.</p>
<p>Over its resilient history in the United States, various iterations of racial science including eugenics, craniology, IQ testing, and genomics helped to install and authorize the intellectual, cultural, and social firmament necessary to produce race as a <em>purported </em>social fact. With appeals variously to religion, science, philology, and the state, racial science endeavored to show that like the world of nature, the social world of history and culture could be described and apprehended by classifying, ordering, assigning value, and searching for variation (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/robinson-cedric-j/">Robinson 2007</a>).</p>
<p>Considering the relationship among race, science, and media as dynamic and a technique of power (each part or component of the alignment moving independent and with different temporalities and logic) is a productive way to think about the connection among genomic racial science, digital media, and postracial discourses of diversity, multiculturalism, and color blindness. While similar relationships organized accounts of race from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the emphasis on the constitutive elements of new racial projects permits researchers to track race and the projects that produce them into new zones of knowledge, authority, and expression such as genomics, ancestry, new media technologies, and admixtures of racial diversity.</p>
<p>In the United States, the cultural visibility of race and the legal rejection of race-based policies by twenty-first-century practices of science, media, and postracial diversity provide powerful alibis to disavow race (certainly of the nineteenth- and twentieth-century sense) in the organization, distribution, and access to safety and security, and to recognize, even celebrate, multicultural identities and histories. Similarly, in the case of media platforms that include social media networks, gaming, entertainment, and streaming content, race is avowed in the form of multicultural lifestyle markets and disavowed based on consumer sovereignty and market neutrality, the cornerstone of which is economic capacity and resources, market variation, and consumer needs. Marketable distinctions, and most especially those organized around racial and ethnic differences (but marketed as cultural distinctions), drive access and representation in media. In the case of social media platforms, participation by racial groups is not precluded on racial grounds but operates on the basis of revised twentieth-century racial models of separate but equal media content, platforms, and representation (e.g., black social media networks or ethnic language media).</p>
<p>In genomic racial science, racial difference operates in the search for scientifically neutral and statistically significant genomic variation and genealogical clustering by populations. In other words, scientists attempt to identify and rigorously measure human variations according to (socially generated) group classification on the basis of statistical estimates of gene frequencies that differ among geographic populations. This form of racial knowledge allows for the proliferation of population variation and geographical distribution, the search for original and authentic bloodlines, and genealogical recuperation underwritten by scientific authority staked in rigorous quantitative techniques and complex computational methods and by a liberal humanism that recognizes and in some cases collaborates with members of diverse population groups. Despite this concern with rigor, scientific neutrality, and recognition of difference, racial science of genomics operates through the social and cultural optic of racial distinction. In the commitment to social diversity in social and economic affairs and recognition of multiculturalism, both of which disavow the salience of race, ironically race is produced on the basis of racial knowledge and social meaning tempered by science, media, and culture.</p>
<p>Making race by disavowing racial difference, I read as a bid to parse the truth of race as still a fundamental feature of the social order and not just seeing race as a matter of targeting a specific group, identity, or location. In this sense we could say that, with intensification of race making in genomics and digital technologies, race is an effect of projects that produce racial understandings and racial truths that are no less pernicious in their social, cultural, and political effects than their nineteenth- and twentieth-century predecessors.</p>
<p>Two main challenges therefore confront the next generation of media studies of race. The first challenge is to track down and connect the new racial projects, the social basis of knowledge and truth of race they produce and their role in organizing the social order they help to secure. In other words, what exactly is the “truth of race” that is being claimed and secured by genomic science and deployed in the new media ecology of difference that organizes access to vulnerability, risk, and insecurity based on the truth of race proffered by racial science? Moreover, where (and exactly how) are forms of race making produced?</p>
<p>The second challenge is to raise critical questions and search for alternate imaginations with which to build different accounts of human variation and their role in social worlds. These might include decolonialized (including indigenous) epistemologies as well as residual possibilities that lie dormant and the creative inventions that come with living in the ruins of capitalism (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/weheylie-alexander/">Weheylie 2014</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/wynter-sylvia/">Wynter 2003</a>). Examples include social initiatives by people of color displaced by the 2008 housing and financial crisis in places like Detroit seeking to reinhabit and sustainably develop urban living space long abandoned by capitalist elites, and the emerging global alliances and identification among black and Palestinian youth subjected to surveillance, violence, and containment by state authorities like the police and occupying armies. Of course, as they have in social movements like the Arab Spring, Black Lives Matter, and Occupy, new media and related social networking platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram play roles in social projects challenging and building different conceptions of belonging and practices of sociality.</p>
<p>In the end, the story that I have been telling is about the changing nature of race, the truth of which is a product of the alliance of racial science, mediated technologies, cultural recognition of multiculturalism, and political disavowal of racial differences. The deployment of race takes on different forms, mobilizes different discursive and material resources, and produces different effects across time and space. Race continues to work through multiple and dispersed forms of subjection to the effects of its truth as freedom from and subjection to regulation, vulnerability, risk, and security.</p>
<p>With every new instantiation of this very old story, we have yet another opportunity to make race and the social worlds that it aims to build matter less to manage, regulate, and exploit populations. While we may elect to make race matter more or less in other ways, we need not proceed on this terrain uncritically and without the critical insights learned from fictions of nineteenth-, twentieth-, and now twenty-first-century racial knowledge that claim for themselves racial truth. We are once again in the position to decide how to make race matter less in shaping human history, what the truth of race is, and how it is deployed in the service of human sociality. That is to say, with the questions we ask and the truths we seek from our science and our politics, we are once again in the position to decide what difference race makes for our understanding of human potential and social relations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Space means “denoting time or duration” and “area or extension” (<em>Oxford</em><em> English Dictionary</em>). Media are often credited with the annihilation of space in both of these senses through their collapse of time/duration and compression of distance (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/harvey-david/">Harvey 1989</a>). Yet, media also constitute and produce space, symbolically and materially. Media are fundamentally disorienting and orienting—dislodging us, helping us navigate, and producing space simultaneously.</p>
<p>The possibility to transcend time/space was an early promise of mass media. Newspapers emerged amid the desire to bridge distances to bring news from colonies to ensure the success of the imperial mission (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/warner-michael/">Warner 1990</a>). Television too promised a “window to the world,” providing increasingly suburbanized audiences what <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/williams-raymond/">Raymond Williams (1974)</a> called “mobile privatization,” or the ability to both travel and stay put. Today, we are enjoined to view the Internet, mobile phones, and social media as creating a global world of interconnectedness, where our place-based affiliations matter little compared to our capacity to bridge distances and differences through interconnectivity.</p>
<p>This sensibility of media as space collapsing echoes Walter Benjamin’s influential <em>The </em><em>Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction </em>(<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/benjamin-walter-se/">1936/2008</a>). Benjamin contends that mass reproduction divorces art from its situatedness in a particular space and time, losing its “aura,” or uniqueness and permanence. In contrast to his Frankfurt School counterparts who were more skeptical of mass culture, Benjamin saw the loss of aura as a democratizing possibility. Mechanical reproduction would enable art to travel, change, and be politicized and freed from elitist traditions of ownership tied to spaces of origin.</p>
<p>Benjamin, unfortunately, did not foresee the role that copyright law would play in regulating this travel and how media’s space-collapsing mobilities bump up against territorializations that reinscribe place and time to establish ownership. For instance, Aaron Swartz— who used digital media’s space-compressing capabilities to share scholarly research beyond the hallowed walls of academia—might have been heralded by Benjamin for unhinging art from its elitist institutions, since access to academic research requires institutional privileges that most individuals cannot afford. Despite the medium’s capability for peer-to-peer sharing, Swartz faced up to fifty years in prison and a million-dollar million fine for these actions (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/gould-rebecca/">Gould 2014</a>).</p>
<p>Swartz’s case demonstrates how ownership laws are utilized to reinstate hierarchies of bodies and spaces through governing information access and distribution. Media culture thus does not so much collapse space as it reorganizes it, producing new sensibilities of space by creating new geographies, mobilities, and identities (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/appadurai-arjun-se/">Appadurai 1990</a>). But the capacity for media to reshape geography and mobility is not the result of inherent technical properties of the medium. Instead, these capacities are the result of culturally and historically specific motivations. Television, for example, emerged within a conjuncture marked by the production of social needs that constructed space compression as socially expedient. Within the contours of liberal capitalism and suburbanization, broadcasting served the interests of new institutions of capital, lending, and consumption centered on the home and the subsequent rise of new forms of social organization (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/williams-raymond/">Williams 1974</a>).</p>
<p>Although television served the interests of postwar liberalism and consumer capitalism, its space-compressing possibilities also facilitated collective unrest and resistance. For example, broadcast images of police brutality against black citizens are credited with helping fuel whites’ investments in the civil rights movement in the 1960s, as many visually witnessed the plight of the black body in America for the first time. Likewise, today, space compression serves the interests of global capital, as digital media help to connect global transnational corporations and facilitate the flow of capital across borders, as well as new social movements that utilize digital and social media to facilitate collective social unrest and to agitate against oppressive forces, including those of global capital.</p>
<p>But media are also bound up with the production of space in a materialist sense. Suburbanization, the isolation of the urban core through the highway system, and the electrical infrastructures that made broadcasting possible are central to understanding the rise of television. And the production of new material infrastructures, such as railways, arcades, and department stores, give way to new media forms, as <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/friedberg-anne/">Anne Friedberg (1993)</a> argued with regard to how new experiences in city space at the turn of the century gave way to early conceptions of film.</p>
<p>The study of media space, however, has been largely concerned with media’s representation of space, or more aptly, place. Place is defined by its relationship to a local articulation, marked by its history and specificity in a moment in time (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/massey-doreen/">Massey 1994</a>). Constituting a cultural encounter (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/morley-david-and-kevin-robins/">Morley and Robins 1995</a>), media create new geographies through the travel of images that bring new sensibilities, identities, and ideas from distant places. But representations are also mediated by our situatedness in the places we consume, use, and produce media images. Spaces of media consumption take on a new texture in an era of digital and social media, convergence, and interactivity in which media consumption appears ubiquitous and mobile, where individuals are invited to produce fluid and cosmopolitan senses of identity not bound to a particular place. Even industries of media production, often theorized within a political economic framework that assumes their centralization in place (e.g., Hollywood), are no longer clearly locatable. From the proliferation of media capitals (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/curtin-michael/">Curtin 2003</a>) to the ubiquity of producer/consumer (or produser) spaces and the ever presence of location-based media (media that track or invite you to identify your location), contemporary media production practices reorganize spaces and places of everyday life into potential sites of mediation (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/morgan-parmett-helen/">Morgan Parmett 2014</a>).</p>
<p>Considering media and space as co-constitutive highlights how media are put to work by a variety of social forces to govern everyday spaces in historically and culturally specific ways that can both reinforce and challenge gendered, raced, classed, and sexualized norms. For example, highlighting the significance of early film in instructing audiences on how to adjust to changing gender norms during industrialization and urbanization, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/rabinovitz-lauren/">Lauren Rabinovitz (1998)</a> demonstrates how film spaces were as important as film content in defining new sensibilities of public and private space that hinged on the production of new gendered norms and identities. Likewise, feminist television scholars <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/spigel-lynn/">Lynn Spigel (1992)</a> and <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/mccarthy-anna/">Anna McCarthy (2001)</a> show that television governs uses of domestic and public space, again not just through content, but also through its use in a particular space and context that constitutes and directs the flow and movement of gendered, raced, and classed bodies. Whereas Spigel considers the spatialization of television in domestic spheres to argue that television was a site for working out struggles and anxieties over postwar gender norms in the suburban home, McCarthy considers television in the public sphere, like the pub or airport, where the television’s placement governs social practices in site-specific ways. In these senses, media work as a technology for governing through the production, organizing, and disciplining of space. Cameras and screens, for example, guide the appropriate uses of a particular place, biopolitically producing bodies and behaviors or disciplining and excluding those that contradict “appropriate” uses. Likewise, we are encouraged to use media technologies to reorganize our bodily space in terms of calorie counts or steps per minute to produce our bodies as “healthy” and “fit.”</p>
<p>These examples suggest that theorizing media space pushes critical media studies in a non-media-centric direction (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/media-studies/works_cited/moores-shaun/">Moores 2012</a>), focused on practices rather than objects. Media are more than technologies, systems of production, texts, or audiences, and are instead part of a broader matrix and set of contextual relations. It is in understanding social, political, cultural, and economic life in this broader sense that media space research offers the most promise for critical media studies.</p>
