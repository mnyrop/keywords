				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Access” is usually understood to refer to the opportunity, ability, or right to gain entry to a space or possession of a thing. One of the most common formulations is <em>to have access to </em>a given object, action, or context. Discussions of <em>media access </em>have followed this usage, in terms of gaining access to the means of production, granting access to positive or realistic representations, enabling access to telecommunications networks and mass media content. Typically, media access is prioritized in matters related to news, politics, and economics, while it is less commonly made relevant to discussions of entertainment or social media.</p>
<p>“Access” has a positive and positivist bent; each of the examples above presupposes that it is beneficial for people to have access, and that access is a discrete state that can be identified and achieved. Given these tendencies, it is unsurprising that the use of “access” in media policies and within media studies has routinely conveyed some combination of media availability, affordability, or consumer choice. The limitations of such a discourse of access are evident when we consider US media policies in relation to access and then in relation to disability.</p>
<p>From the Communications Act of 1934, which established broadcasting as a commercial service operating in the public interest, access to mass media has referred to the ability of individuals to act as consumers, making choices from available media technologies and content. “Access” as availability and (limited) choice figured the public largely as receivers of media, rather than as producers. Access to the airwaves was limited by licensing, which ostensibly ensured the public interest and certainly reduced the diversity of producers and enabled the development of broadcast networks and later media conglomerates.</p>
<p>Telecommunications law, by contrast, initially established access in relation to availability and affordability through concepts of universal service and common carriage. Under these provisions, common carriers (such as telephone companies) were protected from liability for the content carried by their networks. This was justified through a mandate for universal service, whereby these carriers would extend access to and use of the network to all, making telephony a public utility managed by private interests.</p>
<p>Yet, availability, affordability, and consumer choice were insufficient tools with which to include people with disabilities in the mediated public sphere. For example, without specialized hardware, the availability and affordability of telecommunications were irrelevant to d/Deaf Americans. Similarly, without closed captions or audio description on television, the public interest of d/Deaf or blind viewers was not met. Routinely, laws, technologies, and studies of media have played catchup, assuming an able-bodied media user and only later considering how people with disabilities might require different conditions in order to access media (Goggin and Newell 2003).</p>
<p>Disability reveals some of the limitations of dominant discourses of “access,” and these limitations extend to any conception of <em>having access to </em>media technologies, affordances, and content. This understanding of “access” leaves out the infinitely variable material and experiential dimensions of access. Media access may take many forms; unorthodox means of accessing media may produce new articulations of bodies, technologies, policies, and culture. The volunteer captioning, informal distribution, and group viewing of films by d/Deaf audiences during the mid-twentieth century represented an intervention into cultures of filmgoing, the practices of Hollywood, and ultimately federal policy, as the nonprofit Captioned Films for the Deaf was brought under the aegis of the federal Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1958 (Schuchman 1988). Conceiving of media access as an object or state of being to be possessed hides such histories and fosters a unitary and potentially exclusionary vision of what access entails and how to promote it. For instance, although graphical user interfaces increased access to personal computing for many people, they created a barrier for blind users; then, in combating the digital divide, programs promoted access to computers that used these systems, reinforcing a singular vision of “access” and further ostracizing those for whom such access was insufficient. The legacy of such histories is that Americans with disabilities remain significantly less likely to have access to, or use, digital media.</p>
<p>Media studies needs to move beyond the noun form of “access” to consider it as a verb. “Accessing” should be seen as a variable moment or process by which one may enter a literal or figurative space, acquiring desired items, activities, or outcomes. If, instead of <em>having access to </em>something—possessing access—we were to think in terms of <em>accessing </em>that thing, more versions of access and subsequent media engagement can be observed, studied, and made the basis of theory. With this perspective, “watching television” ceases to be a taken-forgranted activity and becomes a variable assemblage of screens, remote controls, captions and audio descriptions, tablet computers and mobile phones, domestic and public spaces, individual and group practices. Furthermore, “accessing” must take on a subject; any statement about access must consider <em>who </em>is accessing, forcing considerations of diversity and marginalized perspectives by refusing the normativity of an unnamed subject. In doing this, analyses of media access can make increasingly meaningful interventions in the democratic roles of media content, technologies, and policies. Like formulations of access as availability, affordability, and choice, the framing of access as an object can go only so far. “Accessing” enables deeper, more nuanced, and more inclusive studies of and interventions in the ways in which people and media are brought together.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most common meaning of “aesthetics” today associates it with beauty. We use this term to refer to principles and techniques to make something beautiful, and to our experiences of that beauty. It comes from the ancient Greek <em>aisthetikos</em>, which meant “esthetic, sensitive, sentient, pertaining to sense perception”; that word was derived from <em>aisthanesthai</em>, meaning “I perceive, feel, sense.”</p>
<p>Many human cultures developed explicit principles and rules to be used in order to achieve beauty. Such principles may concern proportion, symmetry, harmony, composition, use of colors, narrative organization, and so on. In between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries in the West, many philosophers developed theories of aesthetic experience, while art academies were teaching artists the practical principles to make beautiful artworks. In the twentieth century, such prescriptive aesthetic systems became less important, but some principles remain widely used (such as Euclid’s golden ratio). Modernist photographers, artists, and architects such as Le Corbusier continued to use the golden ratio as fundamental to their works.</p>
<p>The concept of “aesthetics” has a unique relation to media studies. I can’t think of another concept that is so central to the modern culture industries and yet also to the creation of media by individuals—such as the tens of millions of people worldwide today who use digital tools to make aesthetically refined photos for posting on Instagram, or the hundreds of millions who have the means to purchase beautiful designer clothes and home décor items. The Pinterest social network, which reached a hundred million users in 2015, is dominated by images of beautiful clothes, home décor, crafts, fashion, party ideas, and so on. The photos that we see around us every day have been refined in Photoshop to achieve visual perfection, and cinematography similarly uses digital tools to control precisely the aesthetics of every shot and frame.</p>
<p>In fact, digital tools and software workflows that industry gradually adopted in the 1990s have led to an “aesthetic revolution.” Until that time, many forms of modern media such as television, cinema, and newspapers had limited ways to control their aesthetics. These media did not always use color, or did not have technologies to control its nuances. Digital editing tools and the web as a distribution platform changed this. Now every pixel, line, frame, face, and body can be edited to achieve the desired aesthetic effect. Never before have we been surrounded by so much “engineered” beauty and perfection, especially in the visual sphere.</p>
<p>At the same time, the concepts of beauty and aesthetic pleasure have been almost completely neglected in theories of media. One finds little to no analysis of media aesthetics in media studies textbooks, or in the works of major media theorists after the middle of the twentieth century. Scholars in recent decades in English-speaking countries have focused on the content of media and their social and political effects, and often ignored the forms of media artifacts. Thus, for example, Jill Nelmes’s (2011) <em>Introduction to Film Studies </em>(564 pages) does not even have “aesthetics” or “beauty” in the index, while a search of Campbell, Martin, and Fabos’s (2011) <em>Media and Culture: An Introduction to Mass </em><em>Communication </em>(616 pages) returned 5 pages where the word appeared, with no single sections or chapters devoted to it. I certainly don’t want to critique these and many other excellent textbooks in media studies. Their authors represent the topics, theories, and historical and contemporary academic media analyses that are most influential today, so their omissions of references to aesthetics and beauty are only because these concepts and corresponding industry practices are not widely studied in media and communication theory and history today. This exclusion is unfortunate. Form and the relations between form and content are what make art (including modern mass media and user-generated content) a unique type of human communication and experience. Concern with form and beauty has been fundamental in all human cultures for many thousands of years. Rhythm, composition, patterns or repetitions, expectation and variation, systematic use of color, ornament, grids, and other methodical ways of organizing elements of any cultural artifact in space and time are found in every human culture. Today, all students taking studio courses in art, media and graphic design, film, television, fashion, and other creative fields are taught how to use form effectively, and how to achieve desired aesthetics. And while prescriptive aesthetic concepts and rules of beauty are no longer enforced today as they were in the art academies of previous centuries, particular aesthetic choices and systems (such as minimalism in design or pleasing background blur in photography and cinematography) dominate professional fields.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we are interested in historical or contemporary media culture and media arts, we need to study not only the content of artifacts but also their form. However, if you focus too much on “form” in media studies, you may be labeled a “formalist.” I assume that many people who use the label “formalist” assume that media (and the study of media) are about content (or “representations”), that progressive media artists should be creating particular representations to advance some social or moral cause, and that the job of scholars is to analyze cultural representations either to show how they excluded or misrepresented some groups in the past, or to support progressive artists today who want to use representations to make society more fair.</p>
<p>These are certainly legitimate ideals. However, labeling others who are interested in media aesthetics as “formalist” is very dangerous. While today media and art critics may associate formalism with a certain tradition in Western art criticism of the twentieth century (such as the works of Clement Greenberg), this label was also utilized in communist countries to imprison and kill artists who did not want to create correct representations. After Russia’s 1917 October Revolution, the new Soviet state was first tolerant of some experiments in art, as long as they did not contain anything that could be taken as “counterrevolutionary.” (The literature that could not be published included Dada-like movement in Russian poetry, for example.) But already in the 1920s, the term “formalism” was used in the Soviet Union to criticize in print and in public debates all those who were interested in anything other than ideologically “correct” subjects (including the representations of workers, building of socialism, etc.), and who did not use traditional (nineteenth-century) realist language.</p>
<p>Between 1930 and 1953, many thousands of leading Russian artists were sent to work camps or prisons or were killed based on such criticism. Often an article declaring that this or that artist was a “formalist” or had some “formalist tendencies” was published first in a major newspaper, and after that this artist was stripped of his or her positions, could not find work, and often was arrested. The term “formalism” continued to be used in a very negative sense by Soviet media and art critics until the end of 1980s. Most communist countries followed the examples of the Soviet Union and used the same practices.</p>
<p>But this attack on artistic form and use of the term “formalism” to destroy many artists did not mean that a communist society rejected all forms of aesthetics. On the contrary, once Stalin decided it was time to put arts, culture, and media to work helping to construct a new society—and, at the same time, to offer hardworking citizens pleasurable experience—concerns with form and aesthetics became important. In 1930, the Soviet government dissolved all independent artistic organizations that united Russian modernist artists, and started promoting “classical” and “realist” aesthetic norms in arts. Soviet architects began to build monumental buildings that used rich decorations and followed classical architectural aesthetics (such as the golden ratio). In cinema, rapid disorienting montage and usual points of view were gradually replaced by classical Hollywood film language, and by the focus on beautiful stars adored by millions. The Moscow Metro, constructed in the 1930s, offered citizens of the capital and visitors an unprecedented aesthetic experience—dozens of stations featured marble, mosaics, sculptures, and other decorative elements created by the best Russian artists of the time. Clearly, the future communist state would ideally have many places like this metro, with every building and interior designed to offer the best aesthetic experience. If communist leaders had had Photoshop, Final Cut, Flame, Autodesk, and other contemporary media software, they would have been required tools for all artists to refine the aesthetics and beauty of their creations, from paintings to films, photographs, and print.</p>
<p>One can only hope that the field of media studies will stop conceiving of terms like “formalism” negatively, and begin to study and teach media in ways that better reflect global media production, environments, and experiences today. If aesthetics and beauty are so central for media producers and audiences—including not only professionals but also millions of people who produce aesthetically refined content and share it online—media studies needs to pay equal attention to these dimensions.</p>
<p>How can we add considerations of aesthetics to media studies curriculum and textbooks? Given the centrality of aesthetics to the contemporary media industry and user experiences, this topic should be given sufficient space. Its presentation should not treat aesthetics in isolation, but instead show its roles in the history of media, structures of media industry, social relations, and other topics.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The concept of affect has opened up the study of media practices and technologies as carriers and mechanisms that articulate, direct, intensify, and orient feeling within context-specific social and political configurations. Affect theory provides a way into these configurations, by rethinking and privileging the <em>felt </em>aspects of everyday life, social change, and durable structures of power, in their (in some cases) nonrepresentational aspects. In studying affect, scholars aim to analyze what is not typically accounted for in media studies: how things feel, for whom, and with what potential. As Terri Senft (forthcoming) puts it, the concerns of affect theory exceed what can easily be located in the traditional study of meaning, representation, symbols, and signs.</p>
<p>In <em>The Affect Theory Reader</em>, Melissa Gregg and Greg Seigworth define affect as “what arises in the midst of <em>inbetweenness</em>, in the capacities to act and be acted upon.” It is the term given “to those forces—visceral forces beneath, alongside, or generally <em>other than </em>conscious knowing” that “drive us toward movement . . . thought and extension,” but can also overwhelm, arrest, and frustrate. Simply put, affects are “forces of encounter” and “gradients of bodily capacity” (2010, 1–2; see also Ahmed 2004). They are not necessarily <em>strong </em>in their intensity, but different qualities of intensity register the different work affect does and is doing. For Zizi Papacharissi, affect “is the active ingredient that infuses structures of feeling with different measures of intensity” (2014, 117).</p>
<p>Much of the emphasis in media scholarship on affect is on what affect enables and does rather than what it might mean or represent. Affect theory offers new ways of conceptualizing and studying social collectivities and their structures of affective transmission. It approaches the experiential qualities of embodiment through the capacity to feel, move, and be moved and provides a different set of perspectives on what connects collective social bodies, their modes of relating, and their affiliative, felt structures of togetherness. Affect theory recenters the body <em>as media </em>in media studies analysis (see Gregg and Seigworth 2010) in its phenomenological and dispositional relations to technologies and communication infrastructures (see Lisa Parks, “Infrastructure,” chapter 32).</p>
<p>To study affect requires an ability to interpret the signs and traces of affect’s communicability, its transmissibility (Brennan 2004). Affect tends to be studied via the processes through which it registers and becomes communicable: as ritualized, as means of transmission, and as forces for making experiences audible, visible, and felt. This requires externalized signs and markings of affect’s work and structuring presence, its structures of feeling. Typical research questions ask what affect enables, what it moves or makes movable, what it intensifies, and what it links or articulates. Media practices and communication technologies are central to these movements and articulations of affect, for as Anna Gibbs notes, “media and bodies appear as vectors, and affect itself as the primary communicational medium for the circulation of ideas, attitudes and prescriptions for action among them” (2002, 339).</p>
<p>In film studies and media studies alike, affect theory’s approach to the body as medium interprets bodily gestures, faces, and modes of bodily comportment for nonverbal markings of affective states of being, a physiognomic practice of reading the body, and particularly the face. Some studies interpret exterior surfaces of bodies and their proxies for capacities to feel together. As Beth Coleman (2011) argues in relation to her study of avatars, in “putting a face to things” through emoticons and avatars, networked communities create powerful feelings of copresence that, without facialized interfaces, are difficult to sustain. Some scholars also draw on the physiognomic ideal that one can interpret the exterior of bodies, buildings, and other surfaces in order to access other inaccessible qualities of affective and emotional states of being. Such physiognomic tools of reading are used as a means to interpret collective modes of feeling and bodily response in groups, such as in photographs that capture similar facial expressions made by on-thescene witnesses to terrorist attacks (Sliwinski 2011). Physical movements and bodily gestures might suggest how affective states of being are occupied, carried, and lived, but there is also a risk that media makers, analysts, and viewers might essentialize the body as a machine of affective inscription, a surface of appearances that reveals the truth of shared embodied feeling states.</p>
<p>Affect is also studied through the lens of emotional labor and media work, in recognition that affect is both something that is worked on and something that constitutes a <em>kind </em>of work. One way scholars study how affect structures media making and communicative labor is through the structures of expression that accompany this labor and its surrounding public cultures and sites of meaning making—in training texts, public discourse, management documentation, interviews, and other research materials. These texts leave affective marks and traces, both in what they say through language, image, and sound, but also through how they move, are shared, and are used. Affective labor gives shape to activist communities and networks that take rhetorical and generic form in Twitter scripts, emoticons, tagging, avatar overlays, button clicks that message “I’ve got your back!” and other modes of expressing feeling, care, anger, rage, disappointment, and other shared, and potentially collectivizing, emotions via social media (Gregg 2011; Losh 2014; Papacharissi 2014; Rentschler 2014). Affective labor has increasingly featured in studies of media production cultures, industry studies, and the unand underpaid labor of social media content creators, participants, and commentators—work often described as “labors of love” (which they can sometimes be, but ought not be a reason for undercompensation). Increasingly, work in this area attends to the seemingly banal and unremarkable functions of emerging platforms and apps, what Morris and Elkins (2015) call “mundane software.” Apps and other software tools themselves do forms of affective labor, as commodity experiences of comforting sounds, touch-based pulsating color screen responses, verbalized affirmations, and mechanisms of routine, order, and quantifiable care.</p>
<p>The attention to affective labor in media studies, while long a topic of study for feminist researchers, provides one of the more compelling approaches to affect as something labored on and through, and produced by laboring bodies. Media studies scholars studying activist and cultural labor in affective terms, and the role of affect in social mobilization, concretely locate the stuff and work of affect in what it does, and what people do with it. Through these means, scholars study affect as it becomes communicable—audible, visible, and otherwise palpably felt.</p>
<p>Finally, affect theory provides essential tools and frameworks for robustly analyzing the work that feeling and emotions do in bringing people together, and shaping and moving social collectives, in the process of popular organizing and movement mobilization. Scholars such as Lawrence Grossberg (1992) and Linda Kintz (1995) examine the cultural resonances that media practices tap into, politically—from youth culture and popular music to Christian right book series and intimacy videos—to analyze the links between politicization and the capacity to move people (see Ryan 1991). These links are made, and revealed, in concrete organizing strategies that leave documentary and other mediatic trails, in movement texts, training documents, and marketing plans for Christian publishing houses, among other kinds of materials. Jennifer Petersen refers to these materials as “the discursive side of feelings,” those “under-examined parts of political communication and the role of media in politics” that are largely affective in nature (2011, 14). Networked affective publics also leave digital trails, through hashtags and other devices of aggregation and tonal expression (Mottahedeh 2015; Papacharissi 2014; Rambukkana 2015). To understand this requires that we get behind, analytically, the forms of activist and cultural labor that summon, gather, train, and direct affective experiences around collectivized political movements, often in conditions that are not expressly political. It also suggests that media connectivity is, of itself, an insufficient condition for collective action.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When everyday people talk about appropriation, they use words such as “theft” and “rape”—often speaking about how their favorite artist was pirated. These same terms are used to describe the dilemma of intellectual property—downloading and hook snatching reminiscent of a time not so long ago, when those who paid homage (the Beatles) and those who didn’t (Elvis Presley and Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones) were endemic to how entertainment industries operated. Scandals such as payola in radio, voice-overs in film, black music video exclusion in cable, and reality television in general link to greed but also tie directly to the undergirding notion that if you do not have the means or foresight to copyright your work, or an audience valued by advertisers to protest, your work becomes an unintended category of fair use. Moreover, even when the work is protected, some lives, cultural producers, and cultures appear to matter less than others.</p>
<p>One of the central debates around appropriation is capital: Who gets recognized and remunerated for their cultural labor? Whose songs, style, and innovation become the raw materials for the next million-dollar advertisement for a major corporation like Nike or Pepsi? What dominant (read: white) rapper (Iggy Azalea), producer (Mark Ronson), or filmmaker (Quentin Tarantino) will next capitalize on the cultural work of black and brown creative output? Posing these questions should make it clear that appropriation has material consequences.</p>
<p>Consumers, audiences, and scholars have argued for sampling as a defense against the charge of appropriation. Sampling as an artistic function drives both the rap and the hip-hop industries. The difference, however, is twofold. First, artists typically sample from the same ethnic and cultural mix as those who produced the original track. In other words, sampling and race exist together in respect for the culture. Appropriation, on the other hand, is the distillation and recuperation   of imagery, ideology, beats, style, and sometimes lyrics of not only another artist but, more often than not, of a culture different from the taker’s own. For example, Justin Timberlake’s dance (as Madonna’s did decades prior) and Miley Cyrus’s twerk borrow heavily from black and brown men and women—creative and otherwise.</p>
<p>Many contend that the most egregious examples of appropriation happen in the wearing of a costume. Whether the costumes are donned by college students hosting pimps and hoes parties (code: black), or folks at a Laverne Cox party (code: trans and black), or plain cowboys and Indians play (code: racist from way back), parody becomes the de facto defense of appropriating culture read as non-normative and/or foreign. The material consequences of this play are real. In other words, questions of origin and belonging such as “where are you really from” (code: Asian or Latino) are tied to the ease with which identity can be performed. Such injury as a result of appropriation leads to perceived incompetence, denied opportunity, and heightened rationales for fear.</p>
<p>Appropriation is to the twenty-first century what the 1980s culture wars were to the originators of hip-hop—a fight for recognition and respect and a reflection on origins. To this end, some culture war discourse still lingers in contemporary debates on appropriation, particularly the boundaries around parody and pastiche. Michael Giardina and Cameron McCarthy contend, “increasing processes of electronic mediation have now seemingly separated culture altogether from place; difference has become an abstract value that can be taken from specific groups and settings and combined and recombined in ways that allow . . . magnates . . . to appropriate elements of hip hop culture and sell these elements back into the inner city itself while . . . simultaneously marketed, with overwhelming success, to a White consumer audience” (2005, 148).</p>
<p>Over the past several years, a number of controversies over appropriation have raged in the popular press. The idea that the righteous anger around appropriation and oppression should be checked by the same dominant culture doing it furthers the damage appropriation does. Media studies needs to question what is at stake when media “represent” ethnic culture. What do the continuing changes and shifts in technology transnationally mean for understanding and appreciating divergent cultures? What do filmic homages to black and brown movements, histories, and people couched in white savior motifs mean for day-to-day interactions? Media studies scholars have understudied appropriation. Addressing some of the conundrums that appropriation poses may help enrich and broaden other areas of the discipline.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Assemblage” is the common English translation of the French term <em>agencement</em>, used by philosopher Gilles Deleuze and radical psychoanalyst Félix Guattari to theorize the arrangement and organization of a variety of heterogeneous elements (1975/1986, 1980/1987). The concept of assemblage has proved generative in media studies in its articulation of both the discursive and material aspects of media, and in its consideration of media as arrangements of humans and nonhumans.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Deleuze and Guattari’s approach to philosophy is one that emphasizes immanence over transcendence, multiplicity over individuality, and becoming over being. Assemblages are not static structures but events and multiplicities; they do not reproduce or represent particular forms but rather forms are expressed and each expression is the emergence of something creative and new.</p>
<p>Assemblages have four dimensions. Along one axis the assemblage stratifies or articulates what Deleuze and Guattari (1980/1987) call collective assemblages of enunciation with machinic assemblages of bodies. Collective assemblages of enunciation consist of a regime of signs, of “acts and statements, of incorporeal transformations” (88). Machinic assemblages are assemblages of bodies, actions, and passions, “an intermingling of bodies reacting to one another” (88). When thinking about media from this perspective, we need to take into account a series of processes with both human and nonhuman components. We need to draw the lines between a myriad of devices and bodies, note their affects, intensities, and speeds, and consider how these material arrangements of bodies are stratified with codes, apps, conversations, tweets, and more as a collective assemblage of enunciation.</p>
<p>Along the second axis of the assemblage are relations of territorialization and deterritorialization, that is, on the one hand, the ways the assemblage is being organized and stabilized and, on the other hand, the ways that it is coming apart, its elements being carried away. Territory becomes especially important in understanding both the contingent and infrastructural aspects of mobile media assemblages.</p>
<p>The idea of assemblage has been important for the “material turn” in media studies (Packer and Wiley 2012; Parikka 2010). Rather than studying the meaning of a text (a tweet or online video), this scholarship looks at its arrangement and circulation among other messages and codes through particular contexts of production and reception as well as networks, software, and hardware, the affordances of which contribute to and shape what the message can do. Materialist media studies understands both humans and nonhumans (such as codes, routers, and mobile screens) as having agency in this assemblage. This uptake of assemblage has utility in recent work theorizing mobile media, new forms of television, media and social movements, and surveillance.</p>
<p>Three final points with regard to the concept of assemblage: First, it is not enough to dissect or map an assemblage’s elements. We must consider its capacities: what an assemblage can do, “what its affects are, how they can or cannot enter into composition with other affects” (Deleuze and Guattari 1980/1987, 257). Second, assemblages are not accidental or just contingent but purposeful. “It is not simply a happenstance collocation of people, materials, and actions, but the deliberate realization of a distinctive plan (abstract machine)” (Buchanan 2015, 385; see also Wise 2011). And, third, to think with the concept of assemblage it is not sufficient to simply add up or combine the elements that media studies usually considers (texts, technologies, individuals) and leave it at that. N. Katherine Hayles reminds us the concept of assemblage is a critique of the idea that a unified subjectivity preexists events: subjectivity is produced by the assemblage and not assumed in its construction (2012, 24).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Kate Lacey has observed, there is “an inescapable collectivity suggested by the word ‘audience’” (2013, 13–14). Indeed, Raymond Williams’s <em>Keywords</em>, despite not including the term, analyzes what might be meant by the audience within an entry on “masses,” conveying the cultural and political ambivalences that have historically surrounded the mass audience. The “masses,” we are told, can be “a term of contempt in much conservative thought, but a positive term in much socialist thought” (Williams 1976/1983, 192). Where the former has often viewed mass audiences as lacking in good taste, rationality, and expertise, the latter has instead thought of the mass as standing in for “the people” and the “popular,” that is, acting as a force for democracy. Sonia Livingstone argues that “in audience research, both meanings of audience retain some purchase” (2005, 23)—sometimes audiences represent a problem to be criticized, and sometimes they are a force to be celebrated. In <em>New Keywords</em>, David Morley holds on to the importance of audience as collectivity, contrasting physically copresent audiences with “the mass audience for contemporary forms of broadcasting, which perhaps today supplies us with our primary sense of what an audience is” (2005, 8). However, Morley indicates that the mass audience can no longer be assumed to unify media consumers in space and time. Instead, “cross-border forms of broadcasting often now bring together audiences of people who may be geographically dispersed across great distances, to constitute diasporic communities of various sorts” (2005, 9).</p>
<p>Thinking about media audiences, then, seems to involve evaluating the cultural-political character of these groupings. At the same time, audiences have been said to fall into different categories on the basis of whether they are copresent in space and time (the physical audience), copresent in time but dispersed across different spaces (the mass audience), or scattered across different temporalities and sites (the fragmented or individualized audience). A tripartite taxonomy of audiences has thus become common (Sullivan 2013, 2), with one of the most influential versions of this to be found in Nicholas Abercrombie and Brian Longhurst’s <em>Audiences </em>(1998). Abercrombie and Longhurst analyze “the simple, the mass and the diffused” audience (159). While the “simple” audience means that which is copresent at events, and the mass remains emblematic of large-scale TV audiences watching at the same time according to “linear” scheduling models, the “diffused” audience represents something more than simply fragmentation in line with “nonlinear” video-on-demand or time shifting. Rather, Abercrombie and Longhurst are interested in how being an audience member has escaped the spatiotemporal boundaries of the moments in which we consume media. We are now audiences more of the time, whether this involves reading news about TV shows or film franchises we follow via social media, tweeting and blogging about our favored media consumption and fan objects, watching trailers via YouTube, or so on. In a pervasive media culture, audience identities are not simply enacted in the spaces and times in which we encounter specific media texts—they have become performances of identity that stretch out long before and after such encounters, and hence the term “diffused” audience.</p>
<p>Such audiences become altered kinds of producers of meaning in addition to being consumers, and so hybrid terms such as “produsage,” blending “production” and “usage,” have sprung up to account for new ways of audiencing (Bruns 2008, 215), along with a focus on the “paratexts” that audiences create (Gray 2010). These can include online reviews (Frey 2015) or comments (Reagle 2015), as well as fan fiction, fan vids, or GIFs (Booth 2015). However, we need to avoid exaggerating a sense of media transformation, as if “simple” and “mass” audiences have been displaced by “diffused” audiences incessantly busy shaping user-generated content via Web 2.0. And we should avoid implying that “linear” media have been entirely supplanted by “on-demand cultures” of audience activity linked to the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime. Some of the time we may choose to “binge watch” or “media marathon” TV shows (Glebatis Perks 2015, ix), but we may combine this with attending live events such as gigs, going out to the cinema, or collectively watching “event” TV when it is initially broadcast, such as a <em>Dancing with the Stars/Strictly Come Dancing </em>final. Rather than viewing audience types as a rigid taxonomy or a reductive narrative of media “eras,” we need a far more empirical, nuanced, and theorized sense of how and when these modes interact. As Abercrombie and Longhurst caution, it is important to address the processes that connect simple, mass, and diffused audiences.</p>
<p>With the mainstreaming of social media/Web 2.0, we can argue that such interactions between simple, mass, and diffused audiences have become more intense. Take the UK television premiere of BBC TV’s flagship drama <em>Sherlock </em>and its special episode “The Abominable Bride,” which aired on New Year’s Day 2016. Audiences could watch this as part of a mass audience, or they could catch up with the show via the BBC iPlayer, forming part of a diffused audience. The episode attracted ratings of over eleven million people, making it the most-watched TV program in the United Kingdom across the festive period. But fans also had the option to shift from a mass audience position and enter “simple” audiences by choosing to view “The Abominable Bride” at cinemas.</p>
<p>By choosing to share <em>Sherlock </em>in-person with an anticipated audience of like-minded viewers—as well as treating its cinema release as an elevation and validation of the show’s brand—fans could move between “mass” and “simple” audiences, with this consumer-oriented choice effectively acting as a badge of fan distinction, and separating fans out from the mass of <em>Sherlock</em>’s viewers. But as well as shifting between “mass” and “simple” audiences as a way of performing their dedication to <em>Sherlock</em>—the cinema that I attended included a number of cosplaying fans dressed up in Victorian costumes—audiences could also migrate from a “diffused” to a “mass” audience position. This movement was possible via the sharing of online reviews and tweets within a “zone of liveness” (Crisell 2012, 45, 93) following transmission.</p>
<p>Such a “massification” of <em>Sherlock</em>’s fragmented audience is not strictly unified in time, however, as these viewers can watch the episode at different and individualized points after initial broadcast. Yet UK TV ratings now factor in this partial erosion of the “linear” schedule by counting viewers who watch time-shifted recordings up to a week after transmission; this results in a “consolidated” Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board (BARB) rating as opposed to the initial “overnight” count of those who watched at the time of broadcast (the US Nielsen ratings system likewise includes “live plus 7” figures). These quantifications of the “mass” audience therefore stretch the concept to include those encountering a media text within seven days, assuming a weekly schedule or cutoff of TV viewing that rolls on to following episodes.</p>
<p>Audiences can also use social media to migrate from “simple” audience modes to those with “mass” or “diffused” currency, for example tweeting photographs taken at a red-carpet film premiere or a preview screening. In some cases, audience tweets can be picked up by the mass media and recirculated within entertainment news stories (this happened in media responses to awkward representations of feminism in “The Abominable Bride”); in other cases, tweets and videos can circulate as “spreadable media” within the “networked audience” (Jenkins, Ford, and Green 2013; Marwick 2013, 213).</p>
<p>But if so-called simple, mass, and diffused audiences have increasingly become modes that audience members can move across by using social media or making specific consumption decisions, then Web 2.0’s diffused audience—where viewers continue to perform their audience identities over time—has also made audiences increasingly visible to one another. Media studies typically conceptualizes audiences as collectivities for particular texts, such as studying <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>audiences (Barker and Mathijs 2008) or reality TV audiences (Skeggs and Wood 2012). But there is a notable paradigm shift associated with the rise of social media and “diffused” audiences: audience communities can (and do) now encounter and confront one another far more readily.</p>
<p>I am no longer simply an audience for media texts; I also consume other audience members’ consumption of other media, and as part of fan communities I engage with other fan communities: reading reviews, blogs, Facebook groups, and forums, for example. It is striking, then, that although media studies has deployed a concept of intertextuality for many years as part of its understanding of media culture, there has been little development of any comparable sense of interaudiences whereby audiences are analyzed as relating to other audiences. It is commonplace to consider texts in dialogue with other texts (adaptation, genre, satire), yet still seems unusual to analyze audiences not only in relation to texts but also transversally, if you like.</p>
<p>Scholarship has begun to focus on “anti-fandom” (Gray 2003), where diffused audiences—sometimes known as “haters”—perform their visceral dislike of particular media texts online via hate sites or commentaries. Such dislike often spills over into an othering of the audience for the disliked text, which is assumed to lack taste, knowledge, or even rationality: young women’s culture from <em>Twilight </em>to One Direction has been patriarchally and problematically dismissed in this fashion. And work has also considered “inter-fandom” (Hills 2012), where fans of one media text denigrate fans of another, such as older, male <em>Doctor Who </em>fans being dismayed by the allegedly hysterical “squeeing” of younger female <em>Sherlock </em>fans. But despite such developments in audience studies, there has yet to be a systematic theorization of interaudiences and viewers’ meaning-making relationships to other (imagined and mediated) audiences, across media and even across national boundaries.</p>
<p>Audiences should no longer be defined only in relation to the media texts they read, but should also be approached as a matter of interaudience interactions, coalitions, and otherings. This is one crucial lesson of the tripartite division into simple, mass, and diffused audiences—the more we carry particular audience identities with us through mediatized culture and via user-generated content, the more we engage with other people’s audiencing alongside “official” media content. As a result of this everyday textualization of other people’s views, we find ourselves watching “in common” more routinely than ever before, attending “to television’s intersubjective viewing practices . . . [and] watch[ing] in conversation—direct and variously mediated—with other viewers” (Shimpach 2010, 58). Media audiences are not silos of interpretation cut apart from one another, emerging around isolated media texts. However, reading many prior audience studies, one might be forgiven for thinking that was the case. But studying interaudiences “distances us . . . from the normal media studies assumption that what audiences do . . . is already a distinctive set of media-focused practices rather than an artificially chosen ‘slice’ through daily life that cuts across how people actually understand the practices in which they are engaged” (Couldry 2014, 217).</p>
<p>At the same time, we need to be aware that many claims are made on behalf of and in relation to audiences; ratings and box office figures are presented as evidence of brand value or popularity. And some interaudience interactions can mean projecting what other viewer groups are like in order to dismiss them, for example assuming that soap audiences think the actors are the characters, or presuming that horror audiences straightforwardly enjoy representations of gore and immorality. Audiences may seem ever more visible to us within the world of social media, but this visibility masks the fact that “no representation of ‘television [or other media] audience,’ empirical or otherwise, gives us direct access to any actual audience. Instead, it evokes ‘fictive’ pictures of ‘audience,’ fictive not in the sense of false or untrue, but of fabricated, both made and made up” (Ang 1991, 34–35). We can never gain access—either as scholars or social media users—to the entirety of an audience. It isn’t even clear what this would mean: what boundaries or parameters would we have to posit to contain this “full audience”? Instead, audiences are always a kind of fiction or construct, as Ien Ang (1991, 35) has argued.</p>
<p>But this does not mean that the study of audiences is futile. Quite the reverse, it means precisely that we need to analyze and challenge how representations of audiences are used by media industries, as well as how audience discourses are deployed in interaudience interactions, or by authorities and pundits. How are audiences characterized or gendered; how are their behaviors culturally valued or denigrated? Theorizing the audience thus means, among other things, critiquing forms of cultural power that can seek to naturalize constructed images of specific audiences.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By some measures, media studies has not had a strong tradition of foregrounding authorship, in comparison to literary and film studies’ robust and even contentious traditions. At times, those traditions have influenced media scholarship. But in analyses of television, video games, social media, transmedia, and other forms, some media scholars have set aside the preoccupation with singular authors that is commonplace throughout literary and film studies. In doing so, we have regularly instead made visible the interplay of corporate imprimatur, creative and technical personnel, and active audiences. And yet other media scholars have engaged with author theories in a limited manner, adapting them to television’s mode of production, and focusing on a small set of individual <em>auteurs</em>. Why is the author so categorically emphasized in regard to some media texts and products—and not others? That is, <em>why is an author</em>? Why has media studies taken approaches that differ from those of our apparent disciplinary cousin, film studies, or what has been at stake in our limited engagements with those approaches? What is gained, and what may be lost, in each approach? The answers to each of these questions are quite entangled.</p>
<p>In the postwar period, French film critics embraced both the resurgence of European filmmaking and an influx of Hollywood films that had been in short supply during World War II. In the magazine <em>Cahiers du Cinéma</em>, Francois Truffaut and other critics championed new generations of directors who often doubled as screenwriters, and whose works displayed persistent expressive styles and themes: among them, Max Ophuls, Jean Renoir, and Robert Bresson (Truffaut 1954/1976, 16). British film scholars including Peter Wollen (1972) allowed for oppositions and ruptures within an oeuvre, among other complications. Still, film studies—taking its cue not only from these influential scholars but from the film industry itself, which develops authorship as a kind of branding strategy—fundamentally recognizes the director as the primary authorial agent.</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary media and communication studies, with roots in sociology, psychology, and social theory, long privileged other approaches. A dominant tradition within communication studies has focused on media effects and the role of the audience—not the author—in making media. Striking out in another direction, Theodor Adorno identified the “culture industry” as an authorial agent—one that is profit-seeking and routinized rather than expressive, and mechanistically marked by “an eternal sameness” (1967/1975, 14). If Adorno excised, to a fault, human subjects at the site of production, he also laid groundwork influencing generations of scholars concerned with how industrial conditions shape mass culture.</p>
<p>Later, other influential theorists sought to decenter the biographical author, reminding us that the role is historical, ideological, and not inevitable (Barthes 1967; Foucault 1969/1984). Subsequently, media studies continued to explore diffuse and layered modes of authoring. Following a spate of corporate mergers in the 1980s and 1990s, many scholars intensified scrutiny of the exercise of corporate power in the film and media industries. For example, Jerome Christensen’s notion of the “corporate studio” as a nonperson author (2012, 13) draws on Thomas Schatz’s work on the Hollywood studio system, which identified studio executives—producers, such as Irving Thalberg at MGM—as authors responsible for “house style” (1988). Others explore collaborative and collective modes of authorship typical throughout media production but often obscured by the practice of designating individual authors commensurate with corporate branding strategies, copyright regimes, and institutionalized creative hierarchies. As Jonathan Gray states unequivocally, “Nothing has a single author” (2013, 93). This direction has proven enormously rich, developing as production studies (see Caldwell 2008; Mayer, Banks, and Caldwell 2009b), and accounting, often ethnographically, for the authoring roles of both above- and below-the-line labor. Yet another direction for the study of media authorship reframes the audience as an authoring partner. Stuart Hall offered a model in which, at the point of “encoding,” authorial creativity is practiced within “routines of production, historically defined technical skills, professional ideologies, institutional knowledge, definitions and assumptions, assumptions about the audience and so on” (2001, 167). At the point of “decoding,” the viewer (or reader, or listener) makes meaning shaped by available linguistic and cultural referents, social position, and other factors (Hall 2001, 168–69).</p>
<p>Following Hall, scholars have found the authoring roles of the viewer/player/user particularly conspicuous in interactive and narratively open-ended forms such as video games and those dependent on user-generated content. In the former, the player makes narrativetwisting choices within a defined universe. In the latter case of so-called social media, the user appends content to a corporate platform. Some scholars—such as Axel Bruns, who recognizes each social media user as a producer—champion “participatory culture” as democratizing (2008, 256). Others persuasively argue that digital media corporations readily exploit users’ immaterial and largely unpaid labor (Andrejevic 2013a). After all, “the new Web is made of the big players, but also of new ways to make the audience work”—by occupying the role of author (Terranova 2000, 52).</p>
<p>Even as scholars create new models accounting for authorship in interactive and social media, others borrow directly and indirectly from <em>auteurism</em>. In television, for example, all but a few innovative producers, such as Norman Lear and Aaron Spelling, long remained largely obscure in both popular and scholarly discourses. Many have argued that television has, in recent decades, displayed tremendous aesthetic and narrative complexity (Mittell 2015), and both popular and scholarly critics laud some of its producers, now known as “showrunners.” But the medium is not solely composed of the likes of Matthew Weiner’s <em>Mad Men </em>and David Chase’s <em>The Sopranos</em>, the products of some of the most acclaimed men working in the medium; I choose the gendered examples purposefully, given their status in a still relatively exclusionary canon.</p>
<p>The notion of a canon brings us back to one of the questions that motivated this inquiry: <em>why </em>is an author? Inarguably, the category of author—in the form of director, writer, showrunner, or game designer—is useful: useful to media industry marketing machines, and useful to scholars analyzing bodies of work. But it is only one of many possible approaches to studying media. If critics and scholars <em>over-</em>valorize a few individuals’ bodies of work, we may reproduce hierarchies of taste and power, and underestimate the diversity and vastness of any particular medium. Alternatively applied, as Patricia White argues, the authorship framework may allow for “act[s] of historical retrieval”—even, the designation of new <em>auteurs</em>—where “women’s access to the means of production has been historically restricted” (2015, 2–3). Of course, it is not only female authors but an array of marginalized creative subjects who may be excluded from critical canons. It takes other methods</p>
<p>to recognize the social structures that shore up such restrictions. Inevitably, authors do not stand alone—and cannot be understood in isolation from the conditions of production, tactics of collaboration, and audience response that shape their work in any medium.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The brand is typically understood as the cultural and emotional domain of a commercial product, or the cultural expression of a company or corporation (and increasingly of traditionally noncommercial entities, such as religious and nonprofit organizations). The brand is the recognizable, regularized, and standardized “message” of a company, the result of a complex “branding strategy” (often called marketing). The success of a brand often depends on its stability, and ability to maintain over time a coherent narrative and recognizable expression. In more economic terms, the brand is a way for a company or corporation to distinguish itself from the competition, a way of standing out in a clutter of advertising, marketing, and products. In the contemporary cultural context, branding is not limited to products, but ideologies, feelings, and the self are also branded (Banet-Weiser 2012).</p>
<p>While the brand is often associated with the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of mass production and mass consumption, branding was an important part of earlier forms of commerce and exchange (Moor 2007). Before the brand signified a particular signature of a company, it was seen to denote ownership of property. In the United States of the eighteenth century, branding was the process of creating and distributing a brand name that was protected by a trademark. This was signified most overtly by the branding of cattle so that ranchers could differentiate their own herds. Yet cattle were not the only species branded to signify ownership. People have also been branded as property; slaves in the United States and elsewhere were branded not only to mark ownership for slave owners, but also, and perhaps more importantly, to signify that African slaves were considered property, nonhuman objects to exchange and profit from in an economic market.</p>
<p>Industrialization—the emergence of mass production in the nineteenth century alongside changes in technologies (including printing and design), transportation, and labor practices—ushered in a new era of branding, when commodities began to take on cultural “value” because of the way in which they were imaged, packaged, and distributed in an increasingly competitive commercial landscape (Arvidsson 2006; Lury 2004; Moor 2007). Mass production allowed for more goods to be produced in a cost-effective way, so companies saw a need to distinguish their products as quality goods; branding was the mechanism to achieve this. Importantly, branding in the era of mass production expanded the consumer base for all kinds of products, and thus helped establish the contours of a mass market. Branding became a shorthand, a way of recognizing products and companies through a repeated and regularized logo or trademark.</p>
<p>The brand depends on communication and media technologies. A convergence of modern factors—such as the invention of photography and typewriters, a rising literacy rate, the rise of mass media, the increase in railways, the emergence of the telephone, and more efficient postal systems—all greatly facilitated the success of brands.</p>
<p>In the mid-twentieth century, companies recognized the importance of the brand as having cultural as well as economic value, and leveraged branding as a way to market to a mass culture, one that took shape in a context framed by immigration, social and cultural conflict, and world wars (Moor 2007). Brands took on a role that extended beyond mere economics; during a time of cultural and political upheaval, brands became functional in emotional as well as economic ways. Following World War II, federal housing policies that privileged white middle-class families, suburban development and the subsequent marginalization of racial and ethnic communities to urban spaces, the ideological solidification of the nuclear family, the role that white middle-class women played in the wartime workforce, and the new and increasingly normative presence of the television in the privatized American home all played significant roles in the shifting public and private terrain of consumer culture and were important in establishing the brand as a normative expression not just of consumer products, but also of emotional and cultural identity (Coontz 1992; Lipsitz 1998; Weems 1998). Market-driven networks of communication, such as mass magazines, broadcast television, Hollywood films, and advertising, facilitated relationships between political and social identities and consumption behavior, a practice that only increased as new markets—for women, African Americans, and families—were created and then capitalized upon (Cohen 2003; Cross 2002; de Grazia and Furlough 1996). During this time, major companies like Procter &amp; Gamble, General Foods, and Unilever developed more sophisticated brand strategies and management, as the competition among similar products intensified.</p>
<p>In the later twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, branding began to fulfill an even greater role in the United States (and Europe), in part because the election of conservative governments in the Britain and the United States ushered in an era of privatization and deregulation. This shift meant, among other things, that corporations were considered in a similar way as individuals in a “free market,” so there were fewer regulatory constraints on how corporations could brand and advertise to consumers. As Naomi Klein (2000) has argued, during this time, corporations and businesses began to concentrate less on manufacturing and more on the marketing of goods, labor began to be outsourced from the United States in significant numbers, and branding began to take on a heightened economic significance and cultural value. The cultural economy of advanced capitalism, ever more rapid innovations in technologies and user interactivity, and more sophisticated marketing provides an environment that among other things enables brand strategies in its production of goods, services, and resources. These cultural dynamics create a context in which not only are commodities branded, but identities, difference, and diversity are managed, contained, and even designed as brands. Brand cultures facilitate “relationships” between consumers and branders, and encourage an affective connection based on “authenticity” and sincerity. That is, rather than being targeted as buyers in a purely economic sense, consumers within brand culture are urged to establish a relationship and experience with brands that is personal and intimate, an essential element of their everyday lives.</p>
<p>In the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries, it became clear that advertising and brand managers were developing new strategies to capture the attention of ever more savvy consumers by appealing to affect, emotion, and social responsibility. In fact, the definition of the contemporary “consumer” points not simply to what kinds of purchases one might make; more than that, the “consumer” is a political category or kind of citizenship (Banet-Weiser 2007; Cohen 2003). And, consumption itself is part of what one <em>is</em>, part of the complex framework that constitutes identity. In the contemporary terrain of global, national, and narrow-scale marketing, brands have begun to assume increasingly complex sets of political and activist functions (Arvidsson 2006; Lury 2004). Within the multidimensional contexts of branding, marketers are increasingly turning to campaigns that encourage consumers toward highly cathected, deeply emotional, and personal relationships to brands, so that products bear what is called in market speak “love marks” (Roberts 2005).</p>
<p>Brands are not merely part of economic strategies, but cultural spaces that are often difficult to predict and characterize precisely. Brands, as “love marks,” mean to invoke the experience associated with a company or product, a story they tell to the consumer, and perhaps even a kind of love for oneself. But the story surpasses any tangible product, and becomes one that is familiar, intimate, personal: a story with a unique history. Brands become the setting around which individuals weave their own stories, where individuals position themselves as the central character in the narrative of the brand: “I’m an iPhone,” or “I drink Coke.” While brands are materially visible and often audible through symbols, logos, jingles, sound, smell, and design, the definition of a brand exceeds its materiality. In many ways, commodities have always been bound up in social life. But the contemporary brand is different. The brand is also a cultural outlook, a way of understanding and shaping the world that surrounds us.</p>
<p>A brand is the perception, the series of images, themes, morals, values, feelings, the essence of what will be experienced, a promise. Together, these characteristics consolidate to project a version of authenticity. Because a brand’s value extends beyond a tangible product, the process of branding is different from commodification. The process of branding impacts the way we understand who we are, how we organize ourselves in the world, what stories we tell ourselves about ourselves—and importantly, it is increasingly through our relationship with brands that we feel authentic and “real,” such as when Dove soap tells women to “empower themselves” or Special K cereal implores women to “own it.”</p>
<p>The brand is different from a commodity. While ever more sophisticated in advanced capitalism, commodification remains a relatively static process (though its results may be dynamic). To commodify something means to turn it into, or treat it as, a commodity; it means to make commercial something that wasn’t previously thought of as a product, such as music or racial identity. Commodification is a marketing strategy, a monetization of spheres of life, a transformation of social and cultural life into exchange value. The process of branding, however, is more complex and dynamic than commodification. Branding is clearly inextricable from commodification, but it is also not merely its extension, and is more expansive than turning something into a commodity.</p>
<p>As Viviana Zelizer (2011) reminds us, economic exchange is organized in and by cultural meanings. But contemporary brand culture also comes at this dynamic from the opposite direction: <em>cultural meanings are organized by economic exchange</em>. The process of branding is created and validated in these interrelated dynamics: developing a brand entails the making and selling of immaterial things—feelings and affects, personalities and values—rather than actual goods. It engages the labor of consumers, so that there is not a clear demarcation between marketer and consumer, between seller and buyer. It is the extension of marketing to arenas of life thought to be outside, and sometimes even oppositional to, the market (such as branded social activism). Significant to media studies, the process of branding also involves the mediation of human action through technology, where within digital spaces boundaries of power are blurred, potentially engendering new relationships that take shape within branding logic and language. In a contemporary moment dominated by social media and micro celebrity, branding is intimately connected to media spaces. These entangled discourses are all part of the process of branding.</p>
<p>Celia Lury notes that one of the key stages in late twentieth-century branding practices “is linked to a changed view of the producer-consumer relationship: no longer viewed in terms of stimulus-response, the relation was increasingly conceived of as an exchange” (2004, 24). This changed relationship requires labor on the part of both consumers and marketers, and cannot be explained as commodification, or as the incorporation of cultural spheres of life by advanced capitalism. As Tiziana Terranova (2000) has pointed out, explaining the labor of consumers as commodification or corporate appropriation usually presumes the co-optation of an “authentic” element of a consumer’s life by a marketer: the use of songs of revolution to sell cars on television commercials, for instance, or manufacturing T-shirts emblazoned with “This is What a Feminist Looks Like,” which are then sold at chain retail stores. The brand here also functions as part of one’s political identity, expanding its reach beyond consumption of products.</p>
<p>Understanding the brand in twenty-first-century Western culture requires a complex frame of analysis, where incorporation is, in Lury’s words, “not about capital descending on authentic culture but a more immanent process of channeling collective labor (even as cultural labor) into monetary flows and its structuration within capitalist business practices” (2004, 38–39). This channeling of labor into capitalist business practices is precisely what mobilizes the building of brand cultures by individual consumers.</p>
<p>Alongside the increasing emotional components of the brand, twenty-first-century consumer culture focuses on the individual entrepreneur, “free” to be an activist, a consumer, or both. The brand is increasingly important to this newly imagined subject, defined not in the traditional sense of being a business owner or investor, but as an entrepreneur of the <em>self</em>, a category that has exclusive hints to it but also gains traction as something that ostensibly can apply to anyone (Rose 1999). At the same time, digital technologies and other media have also facilitated the emergence of “networked publics,” where networks between individuals help form collective communities, such as those revolving around feminist, gay, or environmental issues, to name but a few (boyd 2008).</p>
<p>The collapse between business brand strategy and personal identity construction has logic in an economic context where the individual is privileged as a commodity, and where cultural and social life is increasingly organized and experienced through the terms and conditions of business models. Within this context, we witness the development of an increasingly normative brand of the self, or self-branding. As the brand becomes seemingly more diffuse, permeable, and therefore wider-reaching, there is also a continuing blurring of distinctions between and within “products” and “services” so that the dynamic of commercial exchange is increasingly understood within a framework of affective relationships, engagement, and sociality.</p>
<p>This is evidenced in a common marketing slippage between people and brands, where brand managers insist that “brands are like people” and “people are like brands.” This dynamic emerges in force within the variegated practices and policies of neoliberal capitalism. The marketization of social life and the individual indicates that economic practices have been retooled in efforts to reach individuals in ways previously levied by the state or culture, involving key strategies of emotional engagement, authenticity, and creativity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By the time Caitlyn Jenner’s reality program, <em>I Am Cait</em>, premiered in the summer of 2015 featuring the athlete-cum-reality show star, she had already helped to instigate a national conversation about transgender lives. The celebrity phenomenon surrounding Jenner, which arguably mainstreamed the issue of transgender rights in ways that had not been done before, testifies to the cataclysmic reach of the celebrity platform, the increasingly convergent nature of media celebrity, and the imperative to grapple with how a proliferation of “no-holds-barred” access to stars has transformed the notion of twenty-first-century celebrity from earlier models.</p>
<p>The study of stardom and celebrity maintains a distinct but not fully integrated position in media studies, despite the centrality of fame to the production, distribution, and consumption of all media forms. Though scholarly accounts of stardom emerged almost as early as the discipline of film studies, the first scholarly journal devoted to the subject (<em>Celebrity Studies</em>) did not appear until about twenty-five years later, in 2010. The foundational work on stardom adheres closely to mid-twentieth-century developmental paradigms in which film studios carefully groomed and trained stars as properties over long periods of time. Twenty-first-century celebrity, by contrast, often appears more disposable, less dignified, and rooted in flimsier and more superficial modes of identity (Collins 2008). The Internet and the proliferation of reality television have provided impetus for celebrity discourse as well as the financialization of public knowledge about celebrities and new relations between celebrity, neoliberal subjectivity, and entrepreneurial self-branding.</p>
<p>Many of the modes and mechanisms of contemporary celebrity originate in the prehistory of film, television, and digital media. Celebrity, Brenda Weber points out, is “commonly theorized as the by-product of a twentieth- and twenty-first-century media culture that inundates us with indiscriminate images of stars, thus allowing for consumer fetishization through fanzines, web sites, entertainment programming, celebrity talk shows, inside editions, etc.” Yet, she contends that “in the centuries before our own celebrity was experienced with no lesser intensity” (2012, 15). In fact, the advent of print cultures, vaudeville theater, and human interest journalism, which burgeoned in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, centralized and democratized the concept of celebrity. Whereas prior to this period fame was anchored by the perception that celebrities were special, different, and distinguished by achievement or birthright, according to historian Charles Ponce de Leon (2002), a twentieth-century turn rendered fame widely available to anyone in the public eye, and highlighted personality as a structuring principle.</p>
<p>As this history suggests, the consistently shifting boundary between “exceptionalism” and “ordinariness” constitutes a central tenet of the field. Stars’ commonplace qualities counterbalance their ability to serve as aspirational figures, and their position with respect to this dichotomy often indexes their commercial value. Silent film star Mary Pickford, for instance, offered up a “girl-next-door” image in her life and in films like <em>Poor Little Rich Girl </em>(1917), a presentation deftly anchored by her wholesome femininity and whiteness, according to Sean Redmond (2007). What this representation belied, however, was “Little Mary’s” (as she was often termed) position as a savvy businesswoman who well understood her commodity value to Paramount Studios, and who ultimately helped to found United Artists, an independent studio that challenged the distribution dominance of her former employer.</p>
<p>Scholars of stardom and celebrity have grappled to determine the extent to which stars’ images are produced by their works, their lives, or, crucially, the overlaps and interactions between them. Typically, stars’ personae worked in conjunction with their casting, though there is reason to believe that lives tend to trump specific acting roles. According to Richard deCordova (2001, 99) “with the star, the actor became the character in a narrative quite separable from his or her work in any film.” Stars remain at once inside and outside their mediatized roles as “characters,” and Richard Dyer’s landmark contribution to the field has been to emphasize the paratextual aspects that make the “star-as-person” indistinguishable from the “star-asperformer” (1998). Dyer coined the term “star image” to explain this concept, and pointed out the need to study ancillary texts associated with stars, which include “everything that is publicly available” about them, such as “the promotion of those films and of the star through pin-ups, public appearances, studio hand-outs and so on, as well as interviews, biographies and coverage in the press of the star’s doings and ‘private’ life” (2004, 2). A central insight arising from the early “wave” of intellectual inquiry into the cultural functions of stardom is that star personae are “always intertextual and syncretic” (in deCordova’s phrasing) sustaining a “coherent continuousness” over and above individual roles and appearances (2001).</p>
<p>Stars’ meanings within the larger cultural milieu are also anchored by their privileged status and ability to serve as aspirational figures. Speaking about the early twentieth century, Sumiko Higashi (2010, 265) observes that “consumption, as signified by stars, became the most visible mark of success for the striving ‘new’ middle class and involved not only acquiring goods but transforming selves.” Stars ground ancillary consumption of material goods, stage lifestyling scenarios, and generally foster regimes of capitalist desire. In an early and influential account, Charles Eckert (1991, 39) goes so far as to suggest that early Hollywood, “drawing upon the resources of literature, art and music, did as much or more than any other force in capitalist culture to smooth the operation of the production-consumption cycle by fetishising products and putting the libido in libidinally invested advertising.” Examples of the ways that stars exerted such influence can be found in Charlotte Herzog and Jane Gaines’s (1991) investigation into the craze for knock-off dresses of the kind worn by Joan Crawford in <em>Letty Lynton </em>(1932); Simon Dixon’s (2003, 96) contention that star homes be read as “ambiguous ecologies” customarily conceptualized and presented in magazine layouts as showcases for the preferred meanings of the star; and, finally, Rebecca L. Epstein’s (2000) argument for a repositioning of the star as a fallible consumer whose fashion choices are to be raked over by a public whose fundamentally critical role displaces the more adulatory relations of the past. It is evident that the contemporary social field is characterized by strengthening links between a range of lifestyle concerns and celebrity authority.</p>
<p>In assessing the trajectory of this discipline, it bears mention that most early theories of celebrity were developed in relation to film stardom, with television typically placed in a subordinate cultural position. “The dominant tendency in star studies has been to denigrate the stature of television stardom, to argue that television does not actually produce stars of the complexity, depth, and cultural value that film does, largely because of the medium’s lesser cultural status and its essential familiarity and intimacy,” maintains Christine Becker (2005, 9). Yet, during the medium’s earliest eras, a television star’s ordinariness was in fact a calculated strategy: positioning stars as natural and authentic helped to court viewers and to ensure that star pitches for various products were seen as genuine (Murray 2005). The notion that celebrity is not only tied to but ameliorated by familiarity and ordinariness has, if anything, gotten only more pronounced in the current era, readily evident in the conceptualization and caption phraseology of entertainment magazine <em>Us Weekly</em>’s “Stars: They’re Just Like Us.” Those stars designated as “ordinary” hence typically enjoy a greater sense of connection with their publics, an effect film critic Richard Schickel (2000) calls “the illusion of intimacy.”</p>
<p>Ground zero for such developments is, of course, reality television, thanks to its emphasis on transparency and accessibility: as Joshua Gamson has argued, “For reality TV, ordinariness becomes a credential for stardom, not its antithesis” (2011, 1065). Indeed, the advent of reality television, and particularly its valorization of self-commodification and self-branding, is crucial for understanding the functioning of stardom and celebrity in the twenty-first century. In such realms, selling oneself replaces being “discovered,” talent is no longer conceptually fixed, and qualities such as scrappiness and determination inexorably come to the fore. Such shifts have implicitly gendered subtexts, particularly given the intensified appetite for female celebrity misfortune and scandal and the gendering of “overexposure” in a fame environment that regularly contrasts the low status of reality celebrity with the artistry and craft attributed to the stars of “quality TV” (Holmes and Negra 2011). Reality regimes witness how infotainment and celebrity gossip edge out conventional news, and serve the synergistic promotional needs of major entertainment organizations. They exemplify new norms of unapologetic and incessant self-promotion and evidence the fact that a public persona increasingly serves as a multiply leveraged commercial asset in a fame economy in which promotional zeal outweighs talent.</p>
<p>In addition to the necessity of appearing ordinary, current stars must negotiate the requirements of new media, which not only allow but often demand stars’ own self reporting (via Twitter, for example), and signal a heightened responsibility to responsiveness. Elizabeth Ellcessor notes that “Internet celebrity is founded even more firmly on illusions of intimacy, expressed not so much in terms of television’s regularity as through perceived access to private, backstage behavior” (2012, 51). Similarly, Alice Marwick has explored how “the mindset and practices of micro-celebrity are made possible by social media technologies, which enable average people to gain the audiences of traditional celebrities” (2013, 115). A recurring element across recent celebrity incarnations has thus been a commitment to transparency in the context of lifestyling discourses that celebrate myriad forms of self-knowledge, and the requirement that stars self-disclose in this way has become de rigueur.</p>
<p>Recently, celebrity use of social media may be seen to up the (techno-consumerist) ante on fantasies of affiliation, engagement, and communication between celebrities and their publics as social media forms facilitate the creation of what Ellcessor (2012) deems “star texts of connection.” As Rachel Hall suggests, new expectations/imperatives for celebrity disclosure should be contextualized within a field of social discourse that denotes transparency as an important credential of security state citizenship (2015, 109–10). We contend that the contemporary convergent environment largely intensifies the predispositions of earlier cycles of celebrity production. Whereas access to film stars was desired by publics but often denied by studios that exerted tight control, acts of self-disclosure and self-branding are now a cornerstone of star labor. We note, then, a transition to a “post-talent” fame ethos where a celebrity’s promotional work is his or her most important (or only) work, and where even the most banal forms of celebrity are zealously multi-platformed to maximize their commercial value.</p>
<p>Despite this emphasis on ordinariness, a gap arguably exists in theorizing the multiple modes of celebrity in play in the highly stratified contemporary field. Fame remains facilitated and arbitrated—a contemporary set of gatekeepers including Simon Cowell, Perez Hilton, Ryan Seacrest, and Kris Jenner are inheritors to some extent of the roles once played by Hollywood gossip columnists and agents. Other developments include the lowered social value of privacy, the widely shared view that fame-seeking celebrities invite constant scrutiny, and the value of disclosure in a tabloid culture (often around the makeover as a device for “authentic” self-disclosure).</p>
<p>While customarily disregarded as trivial and ephemeral, celebrity discourse in the early twenty-first century continues to powerfully model and adjudicate changing social norms, as the example of Olympic athlete Bruce Jenner’s transformation into Caitlyn attests. In recent scholarly work Rachel E. Dubrofsky and Megan M. Wood sound a cautionary note in regard to the assumption that Twitter offers a route to authentic celebrity discourse in ways that challenge or even undo long-standing entertainment industry objectification of women. They find that “tabloid stories about women celebrities use Twitter activity to verify and authenticate them as willing sexual objects, while in stories about male celebrities, Twitter serves as no more than a professional tool” (2015, 106). As such accounts suggest, gendered double standards persist in the realm of celebrity discourse, even as delivery methods have been transfigured. Micro celebrity, self-branding, and the promotional terrain of forms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, and Twitter facilitate fantasies of proximity and affinity with entertainment celebrities, yet testify to the corporatization of sociality. As it stands the premiere function of the focus on minutiae of celebrity activity may be as a substitute and compensatory form of public sphere activity; it fills the space that should be taken up by the deliberations of democratic citizenship and the functions of a watchdog press. Celebrity watchfulness, that is, serves a politics of distraction— while we’re looking one way, powerful and increasingly inaccessible and unaccountable figures in political and economic life are going another.</p>

At their strongest, such controls have constituted censorship, defined as the restriction, suppression, or prohibition of forms of speech and media content deemed to be contrary to the common good. The word comes from the Latin <em>censor</em>, which referred to the officials in the Roman Empire who took the public census, and whose role was also to supervise public behavior and morals. While governments are not the only institutions that can engage in censorship, it has generally been connected to the government of social conduct and the security and protection of the state (M. Dean 2010).</p>
<p>The development of the printing press in the fifteenth century enabled the dissemination of printed works on a large scale. As this challenged the monopoly of the Roman Catholic Church over the production and circulation of religious texts, what followed was a struggle, over more than three centuries, for the right to publish. The long struggle for freedom of the press in seventeenthand eighteenth-century Europe was connected to the ideas of the Enlightenment and political liberalism. Liberal philosophers proposed that society was founded upon the inalienable rights of sovereign individuals, who should freely and collectively determine how they are governed. This required that the powers of the state should be codified in law through some form of constitution, as well as separation of powers between the executive, legislature, and the judiciary. In order to enable a functioning liberal democracy, there needed to be freedom of the press (the “Fourth Estate”) in order to ensure that individuals could freely access all relevant information and opinion relevant to their conduct as citizens in public life. A free press was an integral part of what Habermas (1974) would refer to as a public sphere.</p>
<p>In the spirit of these Enlightenment ideals, the First Amendment to the US Constitution, passed in 1791, proclaims, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” In the wake of the French Revolution of 1789, Article 11 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen also stated, “The free communication of thoughts and of opinions is one of the most precious rights of man: any citizen thus may speak, write, print freely, except to respond to the abuse of this liberty, in the cases determined by the law.” Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, proclaimed in 1948, states, “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.” An influential philosophical statement of opposition to censorship was that of John Stuart Mill, in his 1859 essay <em>On Liberty </em>(Mill 1859/2011). Mill proposed that “the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others” (Mill 1859/2011, 68). In practice, however, there have long been restrictions on the freedom to communicate in both liberal democratic and authoritarian societies. The freedom to communicate has always been subject to general civil and criminal laws, including defamation (communication of a false statement of fact that harms the reputation of another party), breach of copyright, contempt of court, <em>sub judice</em>, vilification, obscenity, blasphemy, and sedition. In addition, there are laws, policies, and regulations that have been specific to the media, including program standards that relate to depictions of sex, nudity, or violence, restrictions on some forms of commercial advertising, and requirements relating to “fairness” and “balance” in news programs.</p>
<p>There have also been “emergency” measures that have been put in place during times of war, but have remained in peacetime. In the United States, the Espionage Act of 1917 was passed shortly after the country’s entry into World War I, and was intended to prohibit interference with military operations or recruitment, to prevent insubordination in the military, and to prevent the support of US enemies during wartime. It has since been extensively used against political dissidents and whistle-blowers, including Daniel Ellsberg when he released the Pentagon Papers in 1971. More recently, the Espionage Act was used to convict Private Chelsea (formerly Bradley) Manning for transmitting classified military documents to WikiLeaks, and to charge Edward Snowden for releasing documents exposing the National Security Agency’s PRISM mass surveillance program.</p>
<p>Among the more contentious areas have been pornography, or the depiction of sexually explicit acts through the media, and depictions of violence in the media. Prior to the 1960s, the definition of a particular work as being likely to “deprave or corrupt” was made largely at the discretion of censors themselves. In the landmark case surrounding the publication of the D. H. Lawrence novel <em>Lady Chatterley’s Lover </em>in Britain in 1960, the courts found that such decisions would need to account for the context in which any individual act is placed within an overall work, the artistic or other forms of merit of the work in question, and the question of whether such material would give offence to a “reasonable person” in light of contemporary “community standards.”</p>
<p>From the 1960s onward, censorship increasingly gave way to classification, and to distinctions being made as to whether a work was deemed to have artistic merit or not, where the work was made available (in a film festival or at an art gallery, for example), whether it was to be made accessible to children or only to adults, and what community attitudes in general were to such material. The introduction of film ratings by the Motion Picture Association of America in 1966, with classifications such as “R” (restricted) and “NC-17” (no one under the age of seventeen admitted), as well as “X” for clearly pornographic films, enabled a much wider range of films to be produced than was the case under the previous Motion Picture Production Code (the so-called Hays Code), whereby film censors could directly intervene in creative production processes.</p>
<p>The Internet has radically transformed debates surrounding the classification of media content. Whereas media content has traditionally relied upon various distribution gatekeepers (publishing editors, broadcast networks, film distributors, etc.), and has been predominantly nationally based, Internet content is potentially global in its reach, platforms are open to huge volumes of user-created media content, the distinctions between public and private media consumption are far less clear, and age-based access restrictions are inherently difficult to apply. An early attempt in the United States to restrict access to “indecent” content on the Internet, the Communications Decency Act of 1996, was struck down by the US courts as unconstitutional in the <em>Reno v. ACLU </em>case. In his judgment, Judge Stewart Dalzell concluded that “the Internet has achieved, and continues to achieve, the most participatory marketplace of mass speech that this country—and indeed the world—has seen” (Godwin 1998).</p>
<p>But debates about censorship on the Internet remain ongoing. The OpenNet Initiative found that, in 2013, forty-three of the seventy-five countries it surveyed engaged in some form of Internet filtering, for political, social, religious, or cultural reasons (OpenNet Initiative 2014). The nation with the world’s largest Internet-using population, the People’s Republic of China, is known for extensive blocking of Internet sites and state monitoring of online content. Even among countries that do not engage in such practices, government agencies often restrict content or issue takedown notices where material is illegal or contravenes social norms: child sexual abuse material, “extreme” pornography, and material that advocates violence against others or terrorism is blocked in multiple jurisdictions (Edwards 2009).</p>
<p>The sheer volume of content on the Internet, and the impossibility of state agencies being able to monitor it, has meant that Internet-based companies themselves increasingly undertake such filtering tasks on their websites. Online platform providers have terms of service associated with user access that provide them with considerable discretion in their ability to take down content they deem to be objectionable. The role played by social media platform/service provides such as Google/YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and others in routinely taking down content on the basis of criteria that may range from obscenity to vilification to breach of copyright has opened up issues about the forms of accountability and transparency that accompany such de facto censorship. The issues raised range from the lack of external scrutiny that can be applied to such decisions to the application of different rules in different jurisdictions (e.g., geoblocking content that may offend religious or political sensitivities in some countries), the relationship this has to wider questions of algorithmic governance, or the growing importance of technological algorithms as a means of regulation in the digital realm (Gillespie 2014).</p>
