				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What should we call what happened in and around the Capitol building on Wednesday, January 6? A coup or an attempted coup? An insurrection? A white supremacist riot? Vigilante antidemocratic paramilitary violence? Did those who tried to overturn the election results commit acts of sedition? Treason?</p>
<p>There are solid arguments for any of these terms. The reason any or all of them can seem right is not a sign of intellectual sloppiness or lack of specificity, even as media commentators go to great lengths to come up with specific definitions of the terms they’re arguing for and against in order to make their cases. But no amount of defining can resolve the debate, because other thinkers and writers  can come along and define their terms in ways that make their argument plausible.  Language is social, not indexical.</p>
<p>That the definitions of these terms are contested across time and space means that they are what the scholar Raymond Williams called “keywords.” That means more than that they are rich and complex and important. It also means that the stakes of contestation over their meaning can advance our understanding of our culture and our society. The different ways we talk about the events of January 6 connect to the ways we think  the United States is or is not “united.”</p>
<p>In this dossier, you will find short responses to these events written by authors of some relevant keywords:  “conservative,” “fascism,” “intersectionality,” “populism,” and “whiteness.”  In soliciting these responses, we used these prompts to ask the authors to elaborate on what they had written prior to January 6:</p>
<ul>
<li>As you re-read your keyword essay in the context of recent events in Washington DC, which arguments about the usage of the term still seem most important and relevant? Which, if any, seem less germane?</li>
<li>Are there ways in which the current moment is likely to shift usage of the term? Are there new meanings or usages that have emerged?</li>
<li>Looking forward, what do you think we can/should learn about the current moment through reflection on this keyword?</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps those essays will lead you to read the full essays (also linked here) and then to look for other essays in <em>Keywords for American Cultural Studies</em>. Because—as the cover image on the book indicates—keywords books and essays are meant to be tools. They can be tools for academic analysis; they can also be tools for political understanding and organizing. These brief posts are tools in both of these ways. We hope that you and your students use them well.</p>

<p>Those members of the radical and racist right who led the Jan 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol building, vandalizing the Senate chambers and threatening members of Congress and the police force sworn to protect them, have altered the terms of public debates and collective understanding including, perhaps, our understanding of conservatism.</p>
<p>As I argue in my keyword essay, since the dawn of the 19th century there have been two overarching strands of American conservatism. The first sees itself as a philosophical bulwark against disorder, viewing hierarchies and natural forms of inequality as positive goods for healthy societies. In its Burkean pretensions it views sudden change as inherently dangerous and supports, instead, reforms that are gradual and even evolutionary in nature. In this strand, conservatives are the guardians of liberty and the defenders of our constitutional <em>Republic </em>who have histories of keeping the unruly aspects of full-fledged democracy at bay.</p>
<p>The second strand is more sinister, chaotic, and reactionary. This is the conservatism of “dark money” political machinations of those who fund and fuel the Radical Right. It is a vision of conservatism embroiled in a “deep history” of “stealth planning” to alter the rules of democratic governance. It traffics in conspiracy and disinformation often operating under the guise of grassroots political movements.</p>
<p>Both strands are united in what they understand to be an epic struggle against the forces of the Left. One the one hand, this cynically convenient marriage has not always been a happy one with each side striving to keep their distance from the other. On the other hand, in the last days of the Trump Administration, the feasibility of drawing distinctions between a conservative and a reactionary is growing more dubious by the hour in the last days of the Trump Administration.</p>
<p>In their effort to stop the certification of the 2020 Electoral College for the fraudulently contested presidential race, Republicans linked arms with Far Right forces in ways that pushed the latter from the margins to the center of conservative politics. The sporting of Confederate flags, the display of antisemitic symbols, and the noose erected on the Hill remind us of the degree to which conservatism is historically structured by race, racisms and white supremacy. The startling violence of the mob reminds us too of the lengths to which so-called defenders of the Republic are (still) willing to go to preserve the prerogatives of a white Christian nation, “under God,” when they feel threatened by liberals, leftists and nonwhite activism mobilized in the name of justice, equity and inclusion.</p>
<p>This is not the full story and meaning of conservatism. But as the Republican Party and the American Right continue to navigate the influence of Trump and Trumpism, to many present-day observers the reactionary violence is just more of what conservatism has always been but rarely admitted.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/fascism/">For a limited time, read the full keyword essay on “Fascism”</a></p>
<p>In the days following the right-wing attack on the certification of the electoral college votes in the U.S. Capitol, the debate still churns on among scholars and political commentators: “is this fascism?” As the commentary populates our social media feeds and podcast queues, it is worth considering why determining whether or not “fascism” is the accurate term for what is currently happening has become so important to so many people. Opposition to something called “fascism” represents one of the very few points of unity on both sides of the Cold War; and “fascism” has replaced “monarchy” as the “other” against which democracy is defined.  For this reason, defining something as fascism means to oppose it. The definition comes with the moral imperative: never again!</p>
<p>That moral imperative is what makes the argument over the “f-word” heated. For some leftist scholars, the argument that Trump is<em> not </em>a fascist is accompanied by arguments that neither he nor the movement around him represent a serious threat. Informed by the history of Cold War liberal anti-totalitarianism that lumped fascism and communism together as equal dangers to democracy, this group cautions against the use of the word “Fascism” to explain Trump and Trumpism. For them, the use of the word “fascism” to describe Trump is <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2020/05/19/the-trouble-with-comparisons/)">a hyperbolic or melodramatic representation</a> of the threat posed by <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/corey-robin-on-the-historovox-what-we-missed-about-trump.htm">a “weak” president</a> that places “constant pressure” on the socialist left to “deemphasize our own program” and<a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/01/trump-capitol-riot-fascist-coup-attempt"> form a coalition with neoliberals</a>.</p>
<p>In response, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-neo-fascism-takes-americas-racism-to-the-next-level">another group of leftist scholars</a> has argued that this analysis repeats the very errors of the contemporary observers of the German Nazi party. Those observers allowed fascism to grow because they saw it as weak and ridiculous, while something else – liberalism, communism, or social democracy &#8211; constituted the more serious threat. In response to arguments that Trump’s weakness means he is not a fascist, these scholars <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03071022.2016.1256592">argue</a> that fascists can fail <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-01-16/donald-trump-insurrection-capitol-beer-hall-putsch">citing as an example</a> the Munich “Beer Hall Putsch.”  What is at stake in this debate is less the definition of “fascism” than identifying the biggest political danger to be fought in the present.</p>
<p>While this argument continues, highly regarded historians of fascism continue to disagree about whether Trump is or is not a fascist based on their own long standing definitions. Such academic debates about the meaning of fascism often rest on identifying differences between different forms of authoritarian rule or ultranationalist mobilization, for while historians may agree that all fascisms are authoritarian and nationalist, few claim that all forms of authoritarianism and nationalism are fascist. Robert Paxton, leading scholar of comparative fascism who had long resisted describing Trump as a fascist, despite seeing “resemblances&#8221; <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/robert-paxton-trump-fascist-1560652">recently changed his position</a> because of the use of mass violence against the state on January 6th.</p>
<p>In contrast, Richard Evans, a leading English-language historian of Nazi Germany, <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2021/01/why-trump-isnt-fascist">argue</a><a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2021/01/why-trump-isnt-fascist">d</a> that despite the insurrection, Trump is still <em>not</em> a fascist, because for Evans the core of fascism as a quest for a fully militarized, regimented society, while Trump has publicly disrespected the military and his movement follows a “warped vision of personal freedom: a society in which people aren’t subject to government regulation or supervision, where anarchy and confusion reign.” Despite a disagreement about the core of fascism itself, both Paxton and Evans argue that Trump and Trumpism have already damaged U.S. democracy.</p>
<p>While these historians argue about the relationship of fascist movements to the state, much U.S. commentary on Trumpism as fascism points to the self-proclaimed organized white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and white nationalists who have been among Trump’s most vocal supporters from the beginning. Highly visible on January 6th, waving Confederate Flags, and wearing t-shirts bearing slogans such as “Camp Auschwitz” and “6MWE” (6 million wasn’t enough) they appear to many observers as the primary evidence that “it can happen here.” This mix of symbols and messages also indicates the extent to which the U.S. far right today blends the legacy of slavery, the Confederacy and mythology of the “Lost Cause” with later developments in far-right ideology. In this way, fascists in the United States are no different from fascists in other countries, who also draw from older national mythologies in building their narratives of great national rebirth. In my own view, Trump’s presidency has brought this American fascism closer to the center of national political power than at any time since the 1960s, whether we see Trump himself as a fascist or not.</p>
<p>Recent arguments about whether we should understand Trumpism as “native” to the U.S. or similar to a particularly “European” fascism erase the historically transnational nature of both fascism and anti-fascism. Alberto Toscano <a href="http://bostonreview.net/race-politics/alberto-toscano-long-shadow-racial-fascism">has helpfully surveyed</a> a history of what Cedric Robinson describes as the “Black construction of fascism.”  Fascism, despite being ultra-nationalist, has never been bound by national borders. Hitler modeled the Nuremberg laws on U.S Jim Crow. The U.S. advocates of ”law and order” praised Mussolini. U.S. intelligence agents supporting “White Russians” after WWI helped circulate anti-Semitic, anti-Bolshevik propaganda. The international circulation of fascist ideology has accelerated, but did not originate with the internet.</p>
<p>As we live through a global far-right resurgence whose end we cannot know, we are all discovering that knowing history &#8211; or knowing the “right” definition of a word &#8211; provides no guarantee that we will be able to understand the present with the kind of clarity we wish for. Yet, the debate about the word itself indicates the importance of historiographical argument in  contemporary political decision-making. We may not be condemned to repeat past mistakes, so much as to make new mistakes based on our incomplete understanding of a much-studied past that still remains beyond our reach.</p>

<p>Tens of millions of Americans believe that they were victims of a left-wing coup. For many of them the storming of the Capitol was a democratic act. They watched as people like themselves acted together to disrupt that supposed coup, and defend popular sovereignty. Right-wing insurgency is endlessly nourished by populist narratives that pit the &#8220;the common people&#8221; against elites, which includes both the storming of the Capitol and the pleasures of excess once inside—from feet on the desks of legislators to the wrecking of historical artifacts.</p>
<p>The bipartisan condemnations of Trump and those who besieged the Capitol have been accompanied by calls for a return to &#8220;normal,&#8221; in which the adults in the room would safeguard civility and reason and restore the authority of U.S. economic and democratic institutions from the populist mob.</p>
<p>Yet these responses play right into the hands of the very elites who rob us of the shared resources (both social and material) needed to build alternatives to Trumpism. Many sectors of the American economy where wealth is most concentrated—finance, tech, real estate, energy, military contracting—have realized enormous profits amidst Trump&#8217;s ascent. Hedge fund leaders and oil barons may object to the unseemly sight of the mob rummaging through the Capitol, but they have been materially doing much the same work for years—pillorying public resources and bending the government to serve its interests.</p>
<p>These forces do not express the crudeness and violence of those who stormed the Capitol. But a future predicated on a deference to their authority is no less dystopian, characterized as it will be by rampant wealth hoarding, growing &#8220;deaths of despair,&#8221; and cynicism towards many forms of public action and trust.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s defeat in November surely was a necessary precondition to realize new alternatives. But deferring to the economic and political elites that have set the stage for this carnage will only embolden the far right to continue to provide a kind of reactionary framing to the feelings of abandonment, isolation and betrayal, channeling those energies into ever more dangerous and violent conflicts.</p>
<p>Right-wing populism has always figured the virtuous, manly producer against some combination of those deemed parasitic or threatening, including state or economic elites, people of color, non-white immigrants, women, and gender-nonconforming people.</p>
<p>Understanding the content of right-wing populism in any given context requires an intersectional analysis of the operations of race, class, gender, and sexuality in its expression.</p>

<p>Whiteness is a useful keyword and analytical frame for understanding Trumpism, the false claims of massive voter fraud and a stolen election in 2020, and the Capitol Insurrection of January 6, 2021. As I noted in my original essay on whiteness, a discourse of “white victimhood” has long been in existence, and it has become a culturally dominant force since the 1970s. The rise of Trumpism has stoked and weaponized the grievance politics of “white victimhood.” Trump contended that Mexicans were rapists, Muslims were terrorists, and Black people were destroying cities and the suburbs would be next. Through these claims, Trump and his supporters rendered “Americans” as constant victims of an unfair and racially changing world, and because “white” is a normed and unmarked category, “American” functions as a race-neutral stand-in for “white.”</p>

<p>Whiteness is a useful keyword and analytical frame for understanding Trumpism, the false claims of massive voter fraud and a stolen election in 2020, and the Capitol Insurrection of January 6, 2021. As I noted in my original essay on whiteness, a discourse of “white victimhood” has long been in existence, and it has become a culturally dominant force since the 1970s. The rise of Trumpism has stoked and weaponized the grievance politics of “white victimhood.” Trump contended that Mexicans were rapists, Muslims were terrorists, and Black people were destroying cities and the suburbs would be next. Through these claims, Trump and his supporters rendered “Americans” as constant victims of an unfair and racially changing world, and because “white” is a normed and unmarked category, “American” functions as a race-neutral stand-in for “white.”</p>
<p>I also find Cristina Beltrán’s formulation of “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/01/15/understand-trumps-support-we-must-think-terms-multiracial-whiteness/">multiracial whiteness</a>” helpful in understanding the current conjuncture, Trump’s appeal to select voters of color, and how some people of color have aligned themselves with white supremacy. Beltrán argues that the whiteness of this moment is not a homogenous “racial whiteness” but an ideological “multiracial whiteness.” Beltrán deploys the concept of “multiracial whiteness” to explain how people of color like Ali Alexander, who contributed to the Stop the Steal movement, and Enrique Tarrio, a leader of the Proud Boys, could align themselves with white nationalists.  For Beltrán, “Multiracial whiteness reflects an understanding of whiteness as a political color and not simply a racial identity &#8211; a discriminatory worldview in which feelings of freedom and belonging are produced through the persecution and dehumanization of others.”</p>
<p>The origins of whiteness and its relationship may also offer insights into the recent insurrection. To many the rioting and violence of hundreds of Trump supporters in the U.S. Capitol appeared to be a desecration of democracy and violation of its norms. Yet, if one considers how white supremacy was central to shaping the contours of U.S. citizenship, the rioting at the Capitol is a continuation of an American tradition. Here, I find Joel Olson’s <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-abolition-of-white-democracy">historicization of whiteness and citizenship</a> particularly useful. Like Beltrán, Olson frames whiteness not as a racial category but as a political one. Drawing upon Edmund Morgan, Joel Olson illustrates how voting and rioting were twin elements of an antebellum citizenship rooted in whiteness. Like Trump’s Capitol insurrectionists, early American rioters “took themselves to be protectors of republican institutions. Mob leaders presented themselves as patriots—several claimed to have ancestors who came over on the Mayflower—while mobs christened themselves with names like the Sons of Liberty and the Minutemen” (32).</p>
<p>If we keep in mind these origins of what Olson terms “white citizenship,” then Trumpism, the Capitol Insurrection, and its potential aftershocks will not look like aberrations of U.S. history. “Multiracial whiteness” may appear confounding and novel at first glance, but it is truly a new version of the old story of  “white citizenship.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Abolition” is a word we use when we want to activate scholarship with a sense of urgency, relevance, or potential for the future. W. E. B. Du Bois deployed it in this manner when he coined the term “abolition-democracy” (<a title="DuBois, W.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/du-bois-w-se/">1935/1999, 184</a>) to summarize the grand, unrealized potential of social and economic change initiated during the Reconstruction era. Looking back on the progressive labor politics, liberal economic policies, and civil rights efforts of the late nineteenth century, Du Bois left little doubt that he intended abolition to be a critical modifier for democracy in his own time, providing a corrective to an imperialist, global capitalism bent on exploiting the “basic majority of workers who are yellow, brown and black” (<a title="DuBois, W.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/du-bois-w-se/">16</a>). “Abolition” continues to play this pivotal role in the vocabulary of American studies and cultural studies, interjecting the history of radical social justice movements into conversations about injustices that have not been abolished and charging U.S. history with unmet political needs and ambitions that render it neither finished nor secure.</p>
<p>“Abolition” entered the vocabulary of eighteenth-century Anglo-European liberalism with more specific ambitions. Modifying earlier usages that referenced the disestablishment of religion, the term emerged as a demand and mandate for the termination of the transatlantic slave trade. Laying bare a chain of atrocities that began on the coasts of West Africa, reformers in Britain, France, and colonial America defined this trade as the worst link of a corrupt, monopolistic, state-run international economy that converted Africans into articles of commerce, conveyed them through the horrors of the Middle Passage, and condemned them to punishing, coerced labor on American plantations. Joining a transatlantic consensus of liberal political economists, philosophers, religious figures, and politicians against the slave trade were formerly enslaved authors such as Ottobah Cugoano, Phyllis Wheatley, and Olaudah Equiano, giving abolition the repute of a cosmopolitan, universal ideal (<a title="Gould, Philip." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/gould-philip/">Gould 2003;</a> <a title="Nwankwo, Ifeoma Kiddoe." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/nwankwo-ifeoma-kiddoe/">Nwankwo 2005</a>). Abolition, in this context, linked the end of the slave trade to the claim that Anglo-Europeans and British Americans could halt the degeneration of their own nature, evinced by their barbaric mistreatment of enslaved Africans, and bring their management of the colonial economy and international capitalism under the ethical principles of a “humanitarian sensibility” that recognized all people’s interests and suffering (<a title="Davis, David Brion." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/davis-david-brion/">D. Davis 1975;</a> <a title="Bender, Thomas, ed." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/bender-thomas-ed/">Bender 1992</a>). Because it promised to end the slave trade while upholding whites’ economic and political dominance, this usage of abolition ascribed an inhuman, reactive, and tragic violence to all acts of African and Afro-creole self-liberation, including those that led to the Haitian Revolution in 1795, positioning those more radical acts of abolition as threats to white capitalist rule in North America’s plantation-based societies (<a title="Blackburn, Robin." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/blackburn-robin/">Blackburn 1988;</a> <a title="Fischer, Sibylle." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/fischer-sibylle/">Fischer 2003;</a> <a title="Trouillot, Michel-Rolph." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/trouillot-michel-rolph/">Trouillot 1995;</a> <a title="James, C." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/james-c/">James 1938/1989;</a> <a title="Williams, Eric." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/williams-eric/">E. Williams 1944/1994</a>).</p>
<p>When the U.S. Congress officially ended the importation of slaves into the United States in 1807, it linked this specific usage of the term to the project of nation formation by making the abolition of the international slave trade—but not the domestic slave trade—the ethical cornerstone of a nation whose freedom from colonialism was supposed to have revealed a universal human capacity for liberty. By the 1820s, this abolitionist decree had inspired a new generation of white national leaders to advocate eradicating the degrading colonial legacy of slavery in the United States once and for all, producing a movement that was committed to ending slaveholding and to removing African Americans from the nation’s borders (<a title="Goodman, Paul." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/goodman-paul/">P. Goodman 1998;</a> <a title="Jordan, Winthrop." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/jordan-winthrop/">Jordan 1969</a>). The nineteenth-century “colonization movement,” which enjoyed the broad support of religious and political elites and financed the emigration of freed slaves and free African Americans to Liberia, was an abolition movement in the eighteenth-century sense of the word, to the extent that it identified both slavery and enslaved Africans as obstacles to the moral and national development of whites in the United States.</p>
<p>Just a decade later, a broad coalition of former temperance reformers, free black community leaders, emergent feminists, labor activists, and Protestant evangelicals wrested “abolition” from its past usage and gave it lasting meaning as a synonym for radical social equality and integration. William Lloyd Garrison, a veteran white newspaper editor, affirmed northern African Americans’ participation in the struggle against southern slavery, extending the resources of a robust free black anticolonization movement and employing former slaves such as Frederick Douglass as spokespersons of a national abolition movement (<a title="Stauffer, John." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/stauffer-john/">Stauffer 2004;</a> <a title="Levine, Robert." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/levine-robert/">R. Levine 1997;</a> <a title="Fanuzzi, Robert." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/fanuzzi-robert/">Fanuzzi 2003</a>). Garrison took further advantage of the crisis-oriented moral vocabulary that was flourishing within women’s Christian evangelical movements in pairing “abolition” with the modifier “immediate.” Linked to almost every socially insurgent, publicly visible movement of the antebellum era, abolition made the end of slavery the beginning of a state of racial and gender equality that more moderate opponents of slavery called “ultraism.”</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1960s and ’70s, American studies scholars made ample use of this nineteenth-century history, both to trace the origins of modern feminist and African American civil rights movements and to create an alternative narrative of national progress. Scholars in the emerging fields of African American studies and women’s studies turned the rich archive of nineteenth-century abolition newspapers, propaganda, and literature into the wellspring for a new kind of politics that accommodated categories of gender, race, and embodiment, as well as aesthetic modes of feeling, sentimentality, and interiority. Karen Sánchez-Eppler’s new coinage—“feminist-abolitionist” (<a title="Sanchez-Eppler, Karen." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/snchez-eppler-karen/">1993, 16</a>)—reflected an emerging consensus that abolition was, as Du Bois had suggested, not a fixed historical milestone but an open-ended category for imagining political formations that lay within the domains of literature and culture, outside the legal definition of U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>Labor historians and cultural studies scholars of the 1980s and ’90s also followed Du Bois’s lead and placed the discussion of the abolition of slavery within ongoing capitalist, institutional, governmental, and cultural forces that were responsible for new and intractable forms of racial inequality. Scholars such as <a title="Roediger, David R." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/roediger-david-r/">David Roediger (1994)</a>, <a title="Davis, Angela." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/davis-angela/">Angela Davis (2003)</a>, and <a title="Gilmore, Ruth Wilson.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/gilmore-ruth-wilson-se/">Ruth Wilson Gilmore (2007)</a> worked from the assumption that the end of slavery in 1865 was a necessary but insufficient step in the process of eradicating a structurally racist capitalist system and that the full meaning and realization of abolition would require a succession of modifiers and new mandates, including the “abolition of whiteness” and “prison abolition,” in order to bring scholarship that much closer to understanding the roots of racial injustice, both historical and contemporary. Their accretions remind us that “abolition,” the byword for finality, is at bottom the symbol for urgent democratic social and political change that has not yet occurred.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At once universal and specific, transcendent as well as deeply historical, the property of individual feeling but also affecting the mass subject, “aesthetics” has been notoriously difficult to define. This imprecision explains why aesthetics have often been invoked as a progressive force that opens new conceptual horizons and just as often derided as a tired elitist dodge that preserves the status quo. The unevenness of the ground on which matters of beauty, perception, taste, and the sublime stand results from elemental fissures between art and politics. Such fissures may be more fantasy than actuality, however. When aesthetics are considered in terms of social practice, philosophy, and cultural criticism, they appear as profoundly material engagements with embodiment, collectivity, and social life.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Aesthetics are in their narrowest sense purely about the discernment of formal criteria such as unity, proportion, and balance within the domain of art. If we trace the term’s origins back to the German Romantic tradition of Immanuel Kant and Friedrich von Schiller, aesthetics seem a philosophical topic rather than a cultural conjuncture. Yet even this narrow sense resounds with expansive political and social possibilities. Schiller ([1794] 1954, 25) correlates aesthetic education with “true political freedom,” and Kant ([1790] 1952) orients aesthetic judgment around a shared sensibility that would hold true for all individuals, engendering feelings of the universal. This utopian potential found practical application in the reformist energies of the City Beautiful movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which attempted to unify, uplift, and, perhaps most crucially, “Americanize” the heterogeneous populations of urban immigrants. Theoretically, this emphasis on universality and transformation found its expression in the work of John Dewey ([1934] 1980), who construed aesthetic experience as a vital encounter that challenged the fixity of custom and precedent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These historical and theoretical currents merged in the efforts of pragmatists such as Jane Addams who, like Dewey, sought to make beauty and art a common feature of the modern social landscape. By linking magic lantern shows, art exhibitions, drama clubs, poetry readings, and lectures on art to the cultivation of social ethics, reformers hoped that aesthetics could play a generative role in the democratization of culture. By the start of the twentieth century, this repertoire expanded to include moving pictures, which were often heralded as the first truly mass art form. A central question for the political and cultural projects of both American studies and cultural studies is whether aesthetics can continue to play that role.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The narrow sense of aesthetics as a discourse on art thus leads almost inevitably to broader usages that understand the term to denote the entire “corporeal sensorium,” including affect and emotion, pain and pleasure, feeling and sensibility (Buck-Morss 1992, 5). This emphasis on broad human reactions and responses suggests the potential force of commonality as a universal feeling that collides with and energizes political positions. One way of understanding this emergence of the political within the aesthetic is to say that Kant’s idea of </span><span class="s2"><i>sensus communis</i></span><span class="s1"> ([1790] 1952), a common standard of aesthetic judgment in which individual perception tallies with general taste, recalls Thomas Paine’s notion of “common sense” ([1776] 1953), which marshals public sentiment for the purposes of revolution. Structured by familiar responses and shared stimuli, aesthetics represent the possibility of mass mobilization. Emanations of aesthetic politics—including worker rallies, carnivals, street theater, and mass demonstrations—challenge notions of the public sphere as a zone of rational debate and suggest the importance of performance and play to progressive social movements (Tucker 2010). But such actions echo with political ambivalence; even as collective feeling resounds with democratic energy, the hum of a mass unified—and manipulated—by emotion also carries more ominous overtones of totalitarian control, as Walter Benjamin ([1936] 1968) predicted in his famous essay on mechanical reproduction in the context of the rise of National Socialism in Germany. Since this dire prediction about a fascist future, scholars of the United States’ past along with critics of aesthetics have reflected on the conflicted intersections among art, beauty, and democracy (Castronovo 2007; Greiman 2010; Rancière 2010; Scarry 2001).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the nineteenth-century United States, the potentially transformative effects of aesthetic feeling in galvanizing political opinion appeared in literary sentimentalism. Animating a host of reforms from temperance to women’s rights, sentimentalism figured prominently in the antislavery crusade, culminating in Harriet Beecher Stowe’s directive that individuals confronted with the awesome task of defeating the monster of slavery begin by making sure that “they feel right” ([1852] 1981, 624). Individual by individual, citizens could build a </span><span class="s2"><i>sensus communis</i></span><span class="s1"> that would change the world. The problem, of course, was that individual feeling could remain individualized, forever private, and never connected to shared action or thought. Indeed, Ralph Waldo Emerson, in the poem that introduces his essay “Art,” seemed to imply that when art touches us, it reconciles and adjusts the individual to the social world as it is instead of reshaping the world in accordance with a common regard for justice or fairness. The duty of art, according to Emerson’s couplet, is “Man in Earth to acclimate, / And bend the exile to his fate” (1983, 429). Here, the politics that aesthetics produce come in the mode of resignation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Identifying Emerson with this one-dimensional position ignores his belief that beauty could reinvent ordinary forms of social life. But it was a belief that took hold in the twentieth century among the New Critics, who stressed aesthetics as a formal mechanism of order and stability. “Aesthetic forms are a technique of restraint,” announced John Crowe Ransom (1965, 31), advancing the position that the human rush to action, overflow of emotion, and unpredictable stir of social life could all be reined in by beauty and our responses to it. Cast in this fashion, beauty and art become the conservative guarantors of the social world as it is and not sources for how it might be reimagined and reformed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These lingering effects of social governance and political containment are what motivate some American studies and cultural studies scholars to critique aesthetics as a conservative strategy of retrenchment that justifies art’s putative evasion of political matters, mystifies class privilege as disinterestedness, and uses ideas of harmony and unity to excuse the status quo. As Sacvan Bercovitch and Myra Jehlen framed the issue in their landmark collection </span><span class="s2"><i>Ideology and Classic American Literature</i></span><span class="s1"> (1986), the concentration on artistic qualities and literary effects among previous generations of critics diminished both the social impetus and the radical potential of literature. If we attend to the historicity of beauty and form, as this case against aesthetics goes, the scales of appreciation will drop from our eyes to reveal aesthetics as an evasion of culture. While this assessment is dead-on, it finds its target only by aiming at notions of aesthetics that are themselves culturally thin, cut off from larger—and potentially alternative—histories of form, emotion, and representation. In short, the cultural critique of aesthetics risks overlooking varied strategies of interpretation, expression, and collaboration enabled by the aesthetic project itself. As a central term for American studies and cultural studies, “aesthetics” enables a questioning of the forms by which we organize domains of politics and art in the first place.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Affect” names a conceptual problem as much as a tangible thing. As such, it is best understood as an umbrella term that includes related, and more familiar, words such as “feeling” and “emotion,” as well as efforts to make distinctions among them. The <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> (<em>OED</em>) traces the history of the term to the seventeenth century, aligning it with “desire” or “passion” and opposing it to “reason.” Further specifying that “affect” is both a “mental” and a “bodily” disposition, the <em>OED</em> sets in place a persistent ambiguity that challenges distinctions between mind and body. More technical uses of the term emerge from mid-twentieth-century scientific psychology, where “affect” designates sensory processes or experiences prior to cognition and distinguishes such sensations from the cognitive processes that produce emotions (Damasio 1994). Because affect, emotions, and feelings stand at the intersection of mind and body, cognition and sensation, and conscious and unconscious or autonomic processes, it is not easy to identify the material basis for their social and historical construction, which includes parts of the body (nerves, brains, or guts) as well as environments and transpersonal relations.</p>
<p>As the recent declaration of an “affective turn” in American studies and cultural studies suggests (Clough and Halley 2007; Gregg and Seigworth 2010), the current prominence of “affect” as a keyword represents the convergence of many strands of thinking. Foundational for both fields are French theorist Michel Foucault’s histories of the social construction of categories such as body, gender, and sex that seem like natural phenomena. These categories form the basis for modern notions of subjectivity and power that conceive of the self as possessing a depth or interiority evident in the supposed natural truth of feelings (Foucault 1976/1990). Following this line of research, the affective turn takes up debates about the construction of binary oppositions between reason and emotion and the reversal of hierarchies that subordinate emotion to reason as part of a mind/body split often associated with the seventeenth-century philosopher René Descartes. In the Cartesian worldview, passions, instincts, and feelings are unruly and uncontrollable, requiring subordination to the rational control of reason and the mind—a hierarchical ordering that has sometimes led to a romantic embrace of their subversive power. In response to such reversals, Foucault’s critique of the idea that freedom of expression and resistance to repression constitutes political liberation has inspired cautionary accounts of the politics of affect. Efforts to historicize subjectivity and to conceive of the self in non-Cartesian terms have required new conceptions of affect, emotion, and feeling. Indeed, the use of the term “affect” rather than “feeling” or “emotion” arguably stems from the desire to find a more neutral word, given the strong vernacular associations of “feeling” and “emotion” with irrationality.</p>
<p>Within cultural studies, the project of accounting for social life and political economy through everyday and sensory experiences, including feelings, has an extensive history. Affect, emotion, and feeling have been central to long-standing efforts to combine Marxism and psychoanalysis and to theorize the relations between the psychic and the social, the private and the public. Psychoanalysis has used “affect” and related categories as part of a vocabulary for drives, unconscious processes, and the psychic energies created by both internal and external stimuli. The term “affect” is also present in social and cultural theories that seek alternatives to psychoanalytic models, such as Eve Sedgwick’s use of Sylvan Tompkins, who describes nine affects that link outward behavior with mental and physical states (Sedgwick and Frank 1995; Sedgwick 2003). Whether drawing on psychoanalysis or on its alternatives, accounts of psychic life and felt experience have been important to cultural studies in its efforts to explain the social and political uses of feeling (including the divide between reason and emotion) and to negotiate differences of scale between the local and the global, the intimate and the collective. Raymond Williams’s elusively suggestive term “structure of feeling” (1977/1997, 128–35) is a good example of the use of the vocabulary of feeling to describe how social conditions are manifest in everyday life and how felt experience can be the foundation for emergent social formations. Rather than being attached to one theoretical school or discipline, “affect” has named multiple projects and agendas, including broad inquiry into the public life of feelings. Following Williams, the vernacular term “feeling” remains a useful way to signify these projects, which extend beyond the question of specifying what affects are.</p>
<p>Though the affective turn has conceptual roots in Marxism and psychoanalysis, it has also been significantly catalyzed by feminist critiques of the gendering of dichotomies between reason and emotion, which made their way into the academy from popular culture and political movements. The 1970s feminist cultures of consciousness raising reversed the disparaging association of femininity with feeling and, in a version of the discourse of sexual revolution, celebrated emotional expression as a source of feminine power associated with social and political liberation (Sarachild 1978; Lorde 1984b). Subsequent generations of scholarship in feminist cultural studies have been more skeptical about an easy reversal of the reason/emotion binary, the often essentializing assumption that women are more emotional or nurturing than men, and claims for affective expression’s liberatory possibilities. Instead, this scholarship has provided rich and nuanced histories of the centrality of feeling to the relations between private and public spheres and especially of how the intimate life of romance, the family, and the domestic sphere serves as the foundation for social relations of power (Davidson and Hatcher 2002). In the field of American studies, scholarship on categories such as sentimentality, sensationalism, sympathy, melodrama, and the gothic has shown how cultural genres, especially fiction, produce social effects through mobilizing feeling (Tompkins 1985; S. Samuels 1992; Cvetkovich 1992; Halberstam 1995). Attention to affect is the culmination of several decades of feminist scholarship on clusters of related terms such as “domesticity,” “family,” and “marriage,” as well as on the historical continuities that link women’s popular genres, such as domestic and sentimental novels, theatrical melodrama, and women’s film (L. Williams 2002; Berlant 2008).</p>
<p>The far-reaching impact of feminist approaches to feeling and politics, including their relevance to histories of racism and colonialism, is exemplified by scholarship on the sentimental politics of abolition in texts such as Harriet Beecher Stowe’s <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> (1852/1981), nineteenth-century slave narratives, and contemporary neo-slave narratives. Stowe uses representations of slave mothers separated from their children and innocent slaves being beaten to generate appeals to universal feeling as the marker of the humanity of slaves and as the inherent result of witnessing the evils of slavery. Scenes of sexual intimacy between master and slave prove more affectively complex, however, in <em>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</em> (1861/2001), in which Harriet Jacobs grapples with how to represent her sexual relations with white men without losing the reader’s sympathy. Toni Morrison’s historical novel <em>Beloved</em> (1987) further challenges the tradition of the sympathetic slave mother by telling the story of a woman who tries to kill her three children in order to protect them from slavery, aiming for a more complex representation of the affective life of slavery than stark scenes of innocence and guilt. The powerful fusion of secular forms of religious feeling and maternal sentiment in abolitionist discourses provides a model for the representation of social suffering that has had a lasting impact on U.S. cultural politics in both popular entertainment and the news media. What Lauren Berlant (2008) has called the “unfinished business of sentimentality” persists not just in popular genres produced for women but also in realist and documentary forms of representation, including human rights discourses, in which spectacles of suffering are used to mobilize public action. Affectively charged representation is part of everyday life across the political spectrum, and images of political prisoners at Abu Ghraib, children of war, and unborn babies prompt ongoing debate about the politics of sensation, sentiment, and sympathy (Berlant 2004; Staiger, Cvetkovich, and Reynolds 2010).</p>
<p>Another important area of scholarship in which feeling and affect are central are discussions of trauma and cultural memory that have emerged in American studies as it reckons with the legacies of slavery, genocide, and colonialism. Although the urgencies of Holocaust memory have inspired the creation of public memorials and testimony as forums for emotional expression in Europe and elsewhere, slavery and genocide provide a specifically U.S. genealogy for trauma studies and cultural memory. In seeking to address traumatic histories, public cultures of memory raise questions about what emotional responses constitute a reparative relation to the past and whether it is ever possible to complete the work of mourning, particularly while social suffering is ongoing. Drawing on psychoanalytic categories of mourning and melancholy, critical race theory and queer studies (especially work on AIDS) have produced new theories of melancholy or unfinished mourning as productive rather than pathological. These fields depart from psychoanalytic categories of affect and trauma in favor of vernacular vocabularies of affect in indigenous, diasporic, and queer cultures (Crimp 2002; Eng and Kazanjian 2002; Cvetkovich 2003). Queer studies has also made important contributions to embracing ostensibly negative emotions such as shame and melancholy, as well as theorizing queer temporalities that favor affectively meaningful representations of the past rather than accurate or realist documentation (Love 2007; E. Freeman 2010).</p>
<p>While these critical histories of affect as a cultural and social construct have been extremely generative in American studies, a second important line of research has returned to theories of embodiment and sensation to ask new questions about the material basis for affect, emotions, and feelings. The use of the term “affect” by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari to describe the impersonal intensities, forces, and movements that cause bodies and objects to affect and be affected by one another has been especially influential in recent scholarship (Deleuze and Guattari 1987; Massumi 2002b; Stewart 2007; Puar 2007). Deleuze’s work usefully displaces psychoanalysis and decenters the individuated subject of cognition, locating unconscious bodily processes and sensory life at the center of social life. Deleuze has also been a major catalyst for new materialist notions of affect that distinguish more sharply between “affect” and “emotion,” preserving “affect” for noncognitive processes and using “emotion” to describe socially constructed behavior.</p>
<p>Clearly, the multidisciplinary question of what it means to be a sensory being cannot be confined to one theoretical school, and American studies and cultural studies have been invigorated by proliferating forms of affect studies. Phenomenology and cultural geography have provided resources for materialist histories of sensory experience as well as new accounts of the relations between bodies, objects, and environments and of terms such as “mood” and “atmosphere” (Ahmed 2006; Thrift 2008). Neurobiology and cognitive science have been embraced by scholars in the humanities interested in the interface between brain and body in constituting sensory experience, including reading and other forms of aesthetic and cultural reception (E. Wilson 2004; Zunshine 2006). Animal studies and ecocriticism contribute to a posthumanist concept of humans as integrated with animals, things, and nature and to understandings of affective experience as bodily sensation and vital force (Haraway 2008; Grosz 2011; J. Bennett 2010). With the project of overturning old hierarchies between mind and body, cognition and feeling, reason and emotion largely accomplished, affect studies is now promoting new interdisciplinary inquiry across science and humanities. In so doing, it offers answers to the long-standing problem in social theory of how to think the relation between the psychic and the social worlds and provides resources for building new cultures of public feeling.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The keyword “African” has been and remains a touchstone for African-descended peoples’ struggle for identity and inclusion, encompassing extremes of racial denigration and vindication in a nation founded on the enslavement of Africans. Both the African presence throughout the Americas and its significance for constructions of national culture in the United States have remained fraught with racialized and exclusionary power relations. In a nation that has traditionally imagined its culture and legislated its polity as “white,” “African” has often provided for African Americans a default basis for identity in direct proportion to their exclusion from national citizenship.</p>
<p>As scholars ranging from Winthrop Jordan (1969) to Jennifer L. Morgan (2004) have noted, there was nothing natural or inevitable about the development of racial slavery in the Americas. Nor was the emergence of the racialized category of the African as permanent slave foreordained. European travelers who recorded their initial encounters with Africans did not perceive them as slaves. But their ethnocentric self-regard informed their descriptions of Africans as extremely different from themselves in appearance, religious beliefs, and behavior. European constructions of the bodily difference, heathenism, and beastliness of Africans mitigated occasional observations of their morality and humanity. As European nations experimented with systems of forced labor in the Americas, initially enlisting indigenous peoples and European indentured servants as well as Africans, ideologies of African inferiority facilitated the permanent enslavement of Africans as an expedient labor practice. With the legal codification of lifetime African slavery, European settlers completed the racial degradation of African men and women, a process anticipated in Enlightenment conceptions of difference and hierarchy. In keeping with the contingency of its origins, the idea of the African in America was subject to change and contestation. An awareness on the part of travelers and slave owners of ethnic and regional distinctions among peoples from Africa yielded to the homogenizing idea of <em>the</em> African. Throughout the eighteenth century, slave owners in the Caribbean and North America attributed rebellions to “wild and savage” Africans, leading, on occasion, to restrictions on the importation of African slaves.</p>
<p>During the nineteenth century, free African Americans held an ambivalent attitude toward all things African. It could hardly have been otherwise, given the existential burdens of chattel slavery and the exclusion of Africa and its peoples from Enlightenment ideas of historical agency, modernity, and civilization. Prominent African Americans such as the shipping merchant Paul Cuffee championed emigration to West Africa. Despite his personal success, Cuffee despaired at the prospects for African-descended people to achieve equality in the United States. Inspired by the global antislavery movement, as well as the establishment of the British colony of Sierra Leone as an asylum for Africans rescued from the slave trade, Cuffee believed that emigration would allow Africans and African Americans to realize their full potential. But Cuffee led only one voyage of settlers to West Africa, leaving his entrepreneurial and evangelical objectives unfulfilled. African American enthusiasm for emigration was further dampened by the rise in the early nineteenth century of an explicitly racist colonization movement. The impetus for this movement, which sought the removal of free blacks and emancipated slaves to Africa, came from powerful whites, including slave owners and members of Congress.</p>
<p>Free blacks resented the proslavery motives of colonizationists and increasingly rejected an identification with Africa largely as a matter of self-defense. While the initial wave of schools, churches, mutual-aid societies, and other institutions established by northern free blacks in the late eighteenth century often bore the name “African,” this nomenclature was largely abandoned by the mid-nineteenth century. The reasons for this shift were complex, including demands for U.S. citizenship, black abolitionists’ opposition to the colonization movement, the dwindling population of African-born blacks, and an acknowledgment, at some level, of a multihued African American community resulting from the systemic rape of enslaved black women by white male slave owners. Above all, the term epitomized the stark conditions of exile faced by African Americans, excluded from U.S. citizenship and society and deprived of an affirming connection to an ancestral homeland. Even for leaders of the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, founded in Philadelphia in 1816 when white Methodists refused to worship alongside blacks, wariness toward Africa and a deep suspicion toward its indigenous cultures informed their efforts to evangelize the continent (J. Campbell 1995).</p>
<p>While emigration and colonization movements resulted in the resettlement of relatively few African Americans, the violent exclusion of African Americans from southern politics after emancipation renewed the appeal of Africa as a foundation of African American identity. As Africa came under the sway of European missions and colonialism, the involvement of AME Church missions in Africa and the scholarship of Edward W. Blyden (1887/1967) helped promote among some African Americans a general interest in the welfare of Africans and a greater tolerance for indigenous African cultures. Blyden’s work was part of a long-standing African American intellectual tradition seeking to vindicate Africa by documenting its contributions to Western civilization (Moses 1998). Such scholarship, combined with the worldwide impact of Marcus Garvey’s post–World War I mass movement, helped sow the seeds of African nationalism and anticolonialism. The Garvey movement, which ﬂourished amid a national wave of urban race riots and antiblack violence, built on popular emigrationism and inspired African-descended peoples all over the world with its secular gospel of economic cooperation toward African redemption, even as some African American intellectuals dismissed it as a quixotic “back to Africa” movement. Such controversy may well have informed subsequent debates among black studies scholars over whether it was valid to speak of African cultural retentions, or “survivals,” among the descendants of enslaved Africans in the Americas. The sociologist E. Franklin Frazier and the social anthropologist Melville Herskovits represent the opposing positions in the debate (Raboteau 1978). Frazier believed that the traumas of enslavement and the rigors of urbanization had extinguished all cultural ties to Africa. Herskovits based his support for the idea of African cultural retentions on his research on Caribbean societies and cultural practices. If recent scholarship in history, anthropology, linguistics, religion, literary and cultural studies, historical archaeology, and population genetics is any indication, Herskovits’s position that some African cultural practices persisted in the Americas appears to have prevailed.</p>
<p>As African national independence movements capitalized on the decline of European colonialism after World War II, the idea of the African underwent yet another profound revision in the minds of many African Americans, from intellectual and popular stereotypes of African savagery to images of black power and modernity. The emergence of newly independent African nations beginning in the late 1950s became a source of pride for many people of African descent. Even as blacks believed that the new African presence in world affairs signaled the continent’s full participation in, if not redefinition of, the modern world, members of the U.S. and European political establishment opposed African demands for freedom and true self-determination, trafficking, more or less discreetly, in racist attitudes. In 1960, widely touted as “the year of Africa,” more than thirty African states gained national independence; that year also witnessed the bloody repression of demands for freedom in apartheid South Africa and the Congo. For many northern urban African Americans a generation removed from the violence of the Jim Crow South and facing marginalization in such cities as New York, Chicago, and Detroit, new African states and their leaders, including Ghana’s Kwame Nkrumah and the Congo’s Patrice Lumumba, rivaled the southern civil rights movement in importance. When Lumumba was assassinated during the civil disorder in the Congo fomented by Belgium, African Americans in Harlem and Chicago angrily demonstrated against the complicity of Western governments and the United Nations in the murder. In doing so, they joined members of the black left and working-class black nationalists in a nascent political formation that envisioned their U.S. citizenship in solidarity with African peoples, uniting their own demands for freedom and democracy in the United States with those of peoples of African descent the world over (Singh 2004; Gaines 2006).</p>
<p>Within this context of decolonization, the term “African” became a battleground. To the architects of U.S. foreign policy, African American solidarity with African peoples and their struggles exceeded the ideological boundaries of U.S. citizenship. African American criticism of U.S. foreign policy and advocacy on behalf of African peoples transgressed the limits imposed by a liberalism whose expressed support for civil rights and decolonization was qualified by Cold War national security concerns (and opposed outright by segregationist elements). As some African governments joined U.S. blacks in denouncing violent white resistance to demands for equality, U.S. officials’ assertions of the American Negro’s fundamental Americanness became a staple of liberal discourse. Their view was echoed in press accounts asserting that Africans and American Negroes were fundamentally estranged from one another. No doubt many African Americans still looked on Africans with ambivalence. However, this normative, liberal, and assimilationist notion of African American identity and citizenship provided a context for subsequent debates among African Americans during the Black Power era of the late 1960s and beyond over the terms of an authentic black identity. Contested claims about authentic blackness, particularly when inflected with issues of gender and sexual orientation, can and have had a divisive and self-destructive impact among African Americans (E. Johnson 2003).</p>
<p>As a Janus-faced U.S. nationalism trumpeted its civil rights reforms—seemingly in exchange for consent to its political and military repression of African and, in the 1960s, Vietnamese nationalists—mainstream civil rights leaders endeavored, without success, to formalize an African American position on U.S. foreign policy. It was Malcolm X, among African American spokespersons, who most effectively articulated a growing frustration with the federal government’s domestic and foreign policies toward black and African peoples (Gaines 2006). Along with such post–World War II figures as Paul Robeson, St. Clair Drake, and Lorraine Hansberry, Malcolm X reanimated W. E. B. Du Bois’s decades-old assertion that African Americans sought no less than full U.S citizenship without sacrificing their “Negro” identity and heritage, helping African Americans to embrace rather than shun the designation “African” (Plummer 1996; Von Eschen 1997; Meriwether 2002).</p>
<p>During the 1980s, African American leadership, including many elected officials, waged an effective civil disobedience campaign against the apartheid regime in South Africa and the Reagan administration’s support for it. The rapid acceptance of the term “African American,” championed by Jesse Jackson and others and used in the context of the antiapartheid struggle, represents a profound reversal of decades of shame and ambivalence. Yet it is unclear what relationship the general (though by no means universal) acceptance of “African” as a marker of U.S. black identity today bears to the black transnational consciousness that developed during the 1960s and that ﬂourished during the Free South Africa movement. A major legacy of these social movements for black equality and African liberation has been the legitimation of scholarly investigations of the African foundations of African American history and culture, including studies of the African diaspora and what Paul Gilroy (1993) has termed the “Black Atlantic.”</p>
<p>At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the term “African” remains highly contested in politics and popular culture. On the one hand, crises of poverty, famine, disease (including the AIDS epidemic), and armed conﬂict reinforce an Afro-pessimism in the Western imagination not far removed from the colonial idea of the “Dark Continent,” a place untouched by civility and modernity. While the human toll of such crises is undeniable, the U.S. media generally devote far less attention to democratically elected civilian governments, some of which have supplanted brutal and corrupt military dictatorships supported by the West during the Cold War. These representations continue to view Africans and African Americans through alternately romanticizing and demeaning prisms of race.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the term “African” has come full circle within a society capable of sustaining wildly contradictory views of race. Apart from the usual Afro-pessimism, the African has been incorporated in some accounts into the quintessential U.S. immigrant success narrative, as the upward mobility of highly educated African immigrants is portrayed as an implicit reproach to underachieving native-born African American descendants of slaves. The idea of the otherness of African immigrants in relation to the native-born U.S. black community was widely debated during the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama. Some African American pundits asserted that Obama’s African parentage made him less authentically black than U.S.-born African Americans descended from slaves and, arguably, less entitled to the black vote than his rival in the Democratic primary in 2008, Hillary Rodham Clinton. This view was discredited as Obama’s candidacy gained momentum and as African Americans equated Obama’s run for the presidency with African Americans’ historical struggles for equality. Obama’s election was celebrated internationally, including throughout Africa and in the Kenyan village of his father’s family. As the first African American president, Obama has faced an unusual level of attacks to his person and the dignity of his office, often of a blatantly racist nature. Right-wing pundits and politicians routinely portray Obama’s African heritage as a threat to the republic; Newt Gingrich, during his 2012 run for the presidency, claimed that Obama’s “Kenyan, anti-colonial” worldview was proof of his disloyalty and subversive influence (Costa 2010).</p>
<p>Whatever their origin or occasion, media and political narratives emphasizing tensions between African Americans and African immigrants are the present-day equivalent of Tarzan movies, whose effect is to erase the history and modernity of transnational black subjectivities. While recent scholarship in American studies has called for a rethinking of the black-white color line in U.S. race relations, the tensions expressed by the question of who is an “African” and who is an “African American” are symptomatic of the nation’s continued struggle over the significance of the African presence, past and present, real and symbolic. Of course, the contested meaning and legacy of the African presence is not peculiar to the United States, as many Latino immigrants to the United States bring with them histories and identities shaped by the vexed legacy of racial slavery in their countries of origin. The foundations of Latin American societies, with their diverse populations of Africans, indigenous peoples, Europeans, and Asians, suggests that the expansion of the Hispanic population in the United States does not render the black-white color line obsolete but rather makes it all the more salient as a benchmark for social affiliation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“We hold these truths to be self-evident,” begins the main body of the Declaration of Independence, and the definition of “America” may likewise seem utterly self-evident: the short form of the nation’s official name. Yet the meaning of this well-worn term becomes more elusive the closer we scrutinize it. Since “America” names the entire hemisphere from the Yukon to Patagonia, its common use as a synonym for the United States of America is technically a misnomer, as Latin Americans and Canadians continually (if resignedly) point out. Given the nearly universal intelligibility of this usage, their objection may seem a small question of geographical semantics. But “America” carries multiple connotations that go far beyond the literal referent of the nation-state. In the statement “As Americans, we prize freedom,” “American” may at first seem to refer simply to U.S. citizens, but the context of the sentence strongly implies a consensual understanding of shared values, not just shared passports; the literal and figurative meanings tend to collapse into each other. The self-evidence of “America” is thus troubled from the start by multiple ambiguities about the extent of the territory it delineates, as well as about its deeper connotations.</p>
<p>Seeking out the meaning of America might be said to be a national characteristic, if that proposition were not in itself tautological. The question prompts responses representing every conceivable point of view, from the documentary series packaged as <em>Ken Burns’s America</em> (1996) to prize-winning essays by schoolchildren invited to tackle this hoary topic. Foodways, cultural practices, and even consumer products are readily made to symbolize the nation’s essence (“baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, and Chevrolet,” as a highly effective advertising campaign put it in the 1970s). Such metonyms gesture, in turn, at more abstract notions: Freedom, Liberty, Democracy. Whether implicit or explicit, responses to the enigma of Americanness tend to obscure the conditions under which they were formulated. Who gets to define what “America” means? What institutions help enforce or undermine a particular definition? Under what historical conditions does one group’s definition have more or less power than another’s? Without looking critically at these questions of nomenclature, “American” studies cannot claim self-awareness about its premises or its practices.</p>
<p>Because the meaning of “America” and its corollaries—“American,” “Americanization,” “Americanism,” and “Americanness”—seems so self-evident but is in fact so imprecise, using the term in conversation or debate tends to reinforce certain ways of thinking while repressing others. In the slyly comic <em>Devil’s Dictionary</em> (1911), pundit Ambrose Bierce includes the term only in the form of its opposite: “un-American, adj. Wicked, intolerable, heathenish.” If using the adjective “un-American” shuts down genuine argument by impugning your opponent’s values, as Bierce implies, then the power to define what does count as “American” is a considerable one.</p>
<p>By the time Bierce penned this undefinition, the use of “America” as a synonym for “the United States” was a habit already deeply ingrained, thanks in part to nationalistic writers of the nineteenth century, such as Walt Whitman. Whitman’s original preface to <em>Leaves of Grass</em> tries to get at the essence of the nation by using both terms in rapid-fire succession: “The genius of the United States is not best or most in its executives or legislatures, nor in its ambassadors or authors or colleges or churches or parlors, . . . but always most in the common people.” “America is the race of races,” he continues. “The Americans of all nations at any time upon the earth have probably the fullest poetical nature. The United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem” (1855/1999, 4–5). Whitman’s vision of America / the United States celebrates “the common people,” the heterogeneous mixing of immigrants into a “race of races,” and everyday, vernacular speech as the stuff of poetry. Yet Whitman also includes scenes from Mexico, Canada, and the Caribbean in his panoramic vision of America, revealing not only the expansionist beliefs Whitman held at the time but the extraordinary persistence of this older sense of America as the name for the whole of the New World (another misnomer sanctified by the passage of time, since millions of indigenous inhabitants neither saw it as new nor imagined it on the abstract scale of the Europeans).</p>
<p>Against Columbus’s insistence that the landmass he had “discovered” was Asia, the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci first dubbed it a “New World” in his treatise by that name. It was not Vespucci himself but a contemporary mapmaker, Martin Waldseemuller, who then christened the region “America,” originally referring only to the southern continent. Later cartographers broadened the designation to include the lesser-known north—a further irony of history. To this day, alternative theories of the naming of the hemisphere ﬂourish, finding new devotees on the Internet. Solid evidence links a British merchant named Richard Ameryk to John Cabot’s voyages along the North Atlantic coast, leading to speculation that Cabot named “America” for his patron a decade or so before Waldseemuller’s map. Others have argued that the name comes from Vikings who called their Newfoundland settlement “Mark” or “Maruk”—“Land of Darkness.” Still others have claimed, more circumstantially, that the root word derives from Phoenician, Hebrew, or Hindu terms, suggesting that one of these groups encountered America before Europeans did. Similar etymological evidence has been interpreted to show that the term ultimately stems from a word for Moors or Africans, so that “America” really means “land of the blacks.” “America” is thus a product of the same misunderstanding that gave us the term “Indian.” Given this similarity, one final theory about the term’s origins is particularly provocative. An indigenous group in Nicaragua had referred to one gold-rich district in their territory as “Amerrique” since before the Conquest, and Mayan languages of tribes further north use a similar-sounding word (Jonathan Cohen 2004). These discoveries have led to the radical proposition that the name “America” comes from within the New World rather than being imposed on it. The continuing life of this debate suggests that what is really at stake is not some ultimate etymological truth but a narrative of shared origins; each claim grants primacy and symbolic (if not literal) ancestry of the Americas to a different group.</p>
<p>The fact that only one of these fables of the origin of the word “America” involves an indigenous name is revealing. Throughout the colonies, settlers tended not to refer to themselves as “Americans,” since the term then conveyed an indigenous ancestry—or at least the associated taint of barbarism and backwardness—that they were (with certain romanticizing exceptions) eager to avoid. Instead, they nostalgically called their home spaces “New-England,” “Nieuw-Amsterdam,” and “Nueva España,” reﬂecting the fact that, for most people, local identities took precedence over larger, abstract ones: a problem that the architects of nationhood eventually had to solve. There were some exceptions, however. The sixteenth-century Dominican priest Bartolomé de las Casas initiated an argument that raged across both Americas over whether Vespucci had usurped an honor rightly due Columbus; he proposed rechristening the region “Columba,” and many place-names in Latin America pay homage accordingly. Las Casas gained a considerable following in the English-speaking world, and two of the most powerful writers of the later Puritan period, Samuel Sewall and Cotton Mather, recorded their wish to evangelize the whole of the New World so that it would “deserve the significant name of <em>Columbina</em>” (Sewall 1697/1997, 59). Mather even went so far as to describe himself as an “American” in the introduction to his historical chronicle <em>Magnalia Christi Americana</em> in 1702, well before the national sense of the term was even imaginable. Until the beginning of the nineteenth century, then, “America” and its analogs in Spanish, French, and other European languages designated the whole of the New World. Of the many figurative meanings that the American hemisphere has acquired over time, most involve notions of novelty, new beginnings, and utopian promise.</p>
<p>The Mexican historian Edmundo O’Gorman (1961) inﬂuentially wrote that America was “invented” before it was “discovered,” demonstrating that Europeans had long imagined a mythical land of marvels and riches that they then projected onto the unfamiliar terrain. After Columbus, earlier Christian models of a three-continent globe were amended to include America as the fourth. To create two-dimensional representations of a world now known to be round, Renaissance mapmakers split the globe visually into distinct hemispheres—Europe, Africa, and Asia as the Eastern, and the Americas isolated into the Western. This geographical convenience has become so naturalized that it remains difficult for us to envision, for instance, the interlinked world of the Pacific Rim or the proximity of the points on the transatlantic triangle trade of slaves, sugar, and rum. Similarly, the idea of “Latin America”—comprising not just the continent of South America but a hefty portion of North America as well—is a product of cultural practices rather than any innate geophysical reality: in the nineteenth century, Spanish-speaking elites began using the term to defend and distinguish Franco-Iberian Catholic values from Anglo-Saxon Protestant ones. As Walter Mignolo writes, “Once America was named as such in the sixteenth century and Latin America named as such in the nineteenth, it appeared as if they had been there forever” (2005, 2).</p>
<p>The associations that Europeans projected onto this “new” hemisphere were not always positive, even though the wealth of the American colonies was absolutely vital to the historical shifts we associate with modernization. The common representation of a “virgin land” waiting to be explored, dominated, and domesticated relegates the natural world to the passive, inferior position then associated with the feminine. The French naturalist George Louis Leclerc de Buffon even argued in 1789 that since the region was geologically newer, its very ﬂora and fauna were less developed than Europe’s—a claim Thomas Jefferson (1787/1984) took pains to refute, using examples from South as well as North America. Nonetheless, the notion of the novelty of the Americas persisted, extending to the supposedly immature culture of its inhabitants as well.</p>
<p>Early debates over literature and fine arts in the English, Spanish, and French Americas all focused on the question of whether the residents of a land without history could cultivate a genuine or original aesthetic. Some Romantic writers tried on Indian themes, while others spun this “historylessness” in America’s favor. The philosopher G. W. F. Hegel delivered an inﬂuential address in 1830 that claimed, “America is therefore the land of the future, where, in all the ages that lie before us, the burden of the World’s History shall reveal itself—perhaps in a contest between North and South America. It is a land of desire for all those who are weary of the historical lumber-room of old Europe” (1837/1956, 86). (Note that Hegel still uses “America” to indicate the whole region, not just the United States.) Claims about the New World’s salvational role in global history, then, gestated from without as well as from within. Sewall and Mather’s wish to elevate Columbus over Vespucci was revived after the Revolutionary War in the iconographic figure of the goddess Columbia. In the hands of artists and poets, this imaginary female figure lent a tinge of classical refinement to the nation-building project; the African American Phillis Wheatley (1775/2001) penned one of the very first poems to deploy this image. The figure of Columbia was quite popular during the century that followed, prompting patriotic musings on “the Columbian ideal” as well as events such as the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, calculated to draw international attention to a nation that increasingly celebrated modernity and progress. Voluptuous Columbia continued to appear on coins into the early twentieth century, but there is no contemporary visual icon that corresponds allegorically to the name “America.”</p>
<p>It was perhaps inevitable that the hazy ideas projected so persistently onto the name of the hemisphere and, subsequently, the U.S. nation would spawn other coinages to describe dynamic social processes. “Americanism” and “Americanization” had entered common usage by the beginning of the nineteenth century, referring at first to evolving linguistic differences from the English spoken in Great Britain but expanding their connotations into the general realm of culture. “Americanization” became an everyday word at the turn of the twentieth century, a period of surging immigration, signifying the degree to which those immigrants altered their customs and values in accordance with the dominant view of Americanness at the time. It remains to be seen whether the “Americanization” of immigrants can absorb new meanings beyond this model of one-way assimilation.</p>
<p>Given the long-standing tendency to define America in mythic terms, we must be skeptical of the common boast that the United States is the only modern nation founded on an idea—democratic equality—rather than on a shared tribal or racial ancestry. Such a claim to exceptionalism has been particularly appealing to intellectuals, who traffic in ideas. In the early years of American studies as an academic discipline in the 1950s, the field’s foundational texts located the essential meaning of “America” variously in the history of westward movement, in philosophical and economic individualism, or in the privileging of the future oriented and the new. As the discipline has evolved, it has increasingly attempted to show how such mythic definitions arise in response to historically specific needs and conditions. When we go in search of what is most profoundly American, scholars now insist, we blinker our sights to the ways in which the actual history of U.S. actions and policies may have diverged from those expectations. Moreover, any single response to the prompt to define “America” (meaning the nation-state, not the continent) tends to imply that this larger idea or ideal has remained essentially unchanged over time, transcending ethnic and racial differences. From the nineteenth century forward, “America” and its derivations have generally been used to consolidate, homogenize, and unify, rather than to invite recognition of difference, dissonance, and plurality.</p>
<p>Since the 1990s, interdisciplinary work in American studies has mainly focused on illustrating the ways in which “American national identity is . . . constructed in and through relations of difference,” as one former president of the American Studies Association put it (Radway 2002, 54). She went so far as to suggest that the organization rename itself in response to challenges raised around the time of Columbus’s quincentenary by proponents of an “Americas” or “New World” studies. Such a transnational approach would revive the hemispheric scale of America and consider U.S. cultural productions and social formations in relation to those of Latin America, the Caribbean, and Canada. Rather than Alexis de Tocqueville and Michel Crèvecoeur, its canon of commentators on the meaning of “America” highlights lesser-known figures such as the Cuban José Martí—who in an 1891 speech famously distinguished between “Nuestra” (Our) America, with its mestizo or mixed-race origins, and the racist, profit-driven culture he saw dominating the United States. Martí, like the later activist-writers of African origin W. E. B. Du Bois and C. L. R. James, was critical of the growing interventionist tendencies of the United States in the Western Hemisphere and sought to shift the connotations of the term in provocative ways. In addition to recovering such underappreciated thinkers, comparative Americanist work often locates its inquiry in spaces once relegated to the periphery of scholarly attention, such as the Spanish-speaking borderlands that were formerly part of Mexico. As contact zones between North and South, Anglo and Latino, such areas produce hybrid cultural formations that inﬂect mainstream U.S. culture with that of the “other” America.</p>
<p>Undoing what most Latin Americans see as an imperial arrogation of the name of the hemisphere by the most powerful nation in it has been central to the project of a pluralized, relational Americas studies. Bell Gale Chevigny and Gari Laguardia, in the preface to their landmark essay collection <em>Reinventing the Americas</em>, write that “by dismantling the U.S. appropriation of the name ‘America,’ we will better see what the United States is and what it is not” (1986, viii). The work of divorcing the names that Whitman (and others) wedded together so powerfully has stumbled a bit on the lack of a ready adjectival form in English. A few writers, such as the late Chicano scholar Juan Bruce-Novoa (2004), have recalled into service the neologism that Frank Lloyd Wright coined in the 1930s to describe his nonderivative, middle-class house designs: “Usonian.” Others, including Chevigny and Laguardia, simply substitute “U.S.” or “United Statesian” for “American,” arguing that the very awkwardness of such terms has a certain heuristic value, recalling us to a historical moment before the pressure toward consensus and national unity became as pervasive as it is today.</p>
<p>Perhaps such consciousness raising about the power of “self-evident” terms could indeed begin the slow work of altering social relationships and structures of political power. Yet the plural form of “Americas” and the seemingly more inclusive geography of North America have found their way into some political formations that reinforce, rather than challenge, U.S. hegemony in the hemisphere—such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the U.S. Army School of the Americas, a military training center for Latin Americans whose graduates were implicated in multiple cases of human rights violations in the 1980s and 1990s (and which was subsequently renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation). In these examples, the seemingly more inclusive term works opportunistically rather than critically, suggesting that in the future, the usage of “Americas” may require the same kind of scrutiny that we have just brought to “America.”</p>
