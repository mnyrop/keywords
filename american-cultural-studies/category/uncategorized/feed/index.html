				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Abolition” is a word we use when we want to activate scholarship with a sense of urgency, relevance, or potential for the future. W. E. B. Du Bois deployed it in this manner when he coined the term “abolition-democracy” (<a title="DuBois, W.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/du-bois-w-se/">1935/1999, 184</a>) to summarize the grand, unrealized potential of social and economic change initiated during the Reconstruction era. Looking back on the progressive labor politics, liberal economic policies, and civil rights efforts of the late nineteenth century, Du Bois left little doubt that he intended abolition to be a critical modifier for democracy in his own time, providing a corrective to an imperialist, global capitalism bent on exploiting the “basic majority of workers who are yellow, brown and black” (<a title="DuBois, W.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/du-bois-w-se/">16</a>). “Abolition” continues to play this pivotal role in the vocabulary of American studies and cultural studies, interjecting the history of radical social justice movements into conversations about injustices that have not been abolished and charging U.S. history with unmet political needs and ambitions that render it neither finished nor secure.</p>
<p>“Abolition” entered the vocabulary of eighteenth-century Anglo-European liberalism with more specific ambitions. Modifying earlier usages that referenced the disestablishment of religion, the term emerged as a demand and mandate for the termination of the transatlantic slave trade. Laying bare a chain of atrocities that began on the coasts of West Africa, reformers in Britain, France, and colonial America defined this trade as the worst link of a corrupt, monopolistic, state-run international economy that converted Africans into articles of commerce, conveyed them through the horrors of the Middle Passage, and condemned them to punishing, coerced labor on American plantations. Joining a transatlantic consensus of liberal political economists, philosophers, religious figures, and politicians against the slave trade were formerly enslaved authors such as Ottobah Cugoano, Phyllis Wheatley, and Olaudah Equiano, giving abolition the repute of a cosmopolitan, universal ideal (<a title="Gould, Philip." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/gould-philip/">Gould 2003;</a> <a title="Nwankwo, Ifeoma Kiddoe." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/nwankwo-ifeoma-kiddoe/">Nwankwo 2005</a>). Abolition, in this context, linked the end of the slave trade to the claim that Anglo-Europeans and British Americans could halt the degeneration of their own nature, evinced by their barbaric mistreatment of enslaved Africans, and bring their management of the colonial economy and international capitalism under the ethical principles of a “humanitarian sensibility” that recognized all people’s interests and suffering (<a title="Davis, David Brion." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/davis-david-brion/">D. Davis 1975;</a> <a title="Bender, Thomas, ed." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/bender-thomas-ed/">Bender 1992</a>). Because it promised to end the slave trade while upholding whites’ economic and political dominance, this usage of abolition ascribed an inhuman, reactive, and tragic violence to all acts of African and Afro-creole self-liberation, including those that led to the Haitian Revolution in 1795, positioning those more radical acts of abolition as threats to white capitalist rule in North America’s plantation-based societies (<a title="Blackburn, Robin." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/blackburn-robin/">Blackburn 1988;</a> <a title="Fischer, Sibylle." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/fischer-sibylle/">Fischer 2003;</a> <a title="Trouillot, Michel-Rolph." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/trouillot-michel-rolph/">Trouillot 1995;</a> <a title="James, C." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/james-c/">James 1938/1989;</a> <a title="Williams, Eric." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/williams-eric/">E. Williams 1944/1994</a>).</p>
<p>When the U.S. Congress officially ended the importation of slaves into the United States in 1807, it linked this specific usage of the term to the project of nation formation by making the abolition of the international slave trade—but not the domestic slave trade—the ethical cornerstone of a nation whose freedom from colonialism was supposed to have revealed a universal human capacity for liberty. By the 1820s, this abolitionist decree had inspired a new generation of white national leaders to advocate eradicating the degrading colonial legacy of slavery in the United States once and for all, producing a movement that was committed to ending slaveholding and to removing African Americans from the nation’s borders (<a title="Goodman, Paul." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/goodman-paul/">P. Goodman 1998;</a> <a title="Jordan, Winthrop." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/jordan-winthrop/">Jordan 1969</a>). The nineteenth-century “colonization movement,” which enjoyed the broad support of religious and political elites and financed the emigration of freed slaves and free African Americans to Liberia, was an abolition movement in the eighteenth-century sense of the word, to the extent that it identified both slavery and enslaved Africans as obstacles to the moral and national development of whites in the United States.</p>
<p>Just a decade later, a broad coalition of former temperance reformers, free black community leaders, emergent feminists, labor activists, and Protestant evangelicals wrested “abolition” from its past usage and gave it lasting meaning as a synonym for radical social equality and integration. William Lloyd Garrison, a veteran white newspaper editor, affirmed northern African Americans’ participation in the struggle against southern slavery, extending the resources of a robust free black anticolonization movement and employing former slaves such as Frederick Douglass as spokespersons of a national abolition movement (<a title="Stauffer, John." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/stauffer-john/">Stauffer 2004;</a> <a title="Levine, Robert." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/levine-robert/">R. Levine 1997;</a> <a title="Fanuzzi, Robert." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/fanuzzi-robert/">Fanuzzi 2003</a>). Garrison took further advantage of the crisis-oriented moral vocabulary that was flourishing within women’s Christian evangelical movements in pairing “abolition” with the modifier “immediate.” Linked to almost every socially insurgent, publicly visible movement of the antebellum era, abolition made the end of slavery the beginning of a state of racial and gender equality that more moderate opponents of slavery called “ultraism.”</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1960s and ’70s, American studies scholars made ample use of this nineteenth-century history, both to trace the origins of modern feminist and African American civil rights movements and to create an alternative narrative of national progress. Scholars in the emerging fields of African American studies and women’s studies turned the rich archive of nineteenth-century abolition newspapers, propaganda, and literature into the wellspring for a new kind of politics that accommodated categories of gender, race, and embodiment, as well as aesthetic modes of feeling, sentimentality, and interiority. Karen Sánchez-Eppler’s new coinage—“feminist-abolitionist” (<a title="Sanchez-Eppler, Karen." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/snchez-eppler-karen/">1993, 16</a>)—reflected an emerging consensus that abolition was, as Du Bois had suggested, not a fixed historical milestone but an open-ended category for imagining political formations that lay within the domains of literature and culture, outside the legal definition of U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>Labor historians and cultural studies scholars of the 1980s and ’90s also followed Du Bois’s lead and placed the discussion of the abolition of slavery within ongoing capitalist, institutional, governmental, and cultural forces that were responsible for new and intractable forms of racial inequality. Scholars such as <a title="Roediger, David R." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/roediger-david-r/">David Roediger (1994)</a>, <a title="Davis, Angela." href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/davis-angela/">Angela Davis (2003)</a>, and <a title="Gilmore, Ruth Wilson.SE" href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/works_cited/gilmore-ruth-wilson-se/">Ruth Wilson Gilmore (2007)</a> worked from the assumption that the end of slavery in 1865 was a necessary but insufficient step in the process of eradicating a structurally racist capitalist system and that the full meaning and realization of abolition would require a succession of modifiers and new mandates, including the “abolition of whiteness” and “prison abolition,” in order to bring scholarship that much closer to understanding the roots of racial injustice, both historical and contemporary. Their accretions remind us that “abolition,” the byword for finality, is at bottom the symbol for urgent democratic social and political change that has not yet occurred.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Affect” names a conceptual problem as much as a tangible thing. As such, it is best understood as an umbrella term that includes related, and more familiar, words such as “feeling” and “emotion,” as well as efforts to make distinctions among them. The <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> (<em>OED</em>) traces the history of the term to the seventeenth century, aligning it with “desire” or “passion” and opposing it to “reason.” Further specifying that “affect” is both a “mental” and a “bodily” disposition, the <em>OED</em> sets in place a persistent ambiguity that challenges distinctions between mind and body. More technical uses of the term emerge from mid-twentieth-century scientific psychology, where “affect” designates sensory processes or experiences prior to cognition and distinguishes such sensations from the cognitive processes that produce emotions (Damasio 1994). Because affect, emotions, and feelings stand at the intersection of mind and body, cognition and sensation, and conscious and unconscious or autonomic processes, it is not easy to identify the material basis for their social and historical construction, which includes parts of the body (nerves, brains, or guts) as well as environments and transpersonal relations.</p>
<p>As the recent declaration of an “affective turn” in American studies and cultural studies suggests (Clough and Halley 2007; Gregg and Seigworth 2010), the current prominence of “affect” as a keyword represents the convergence of many strands of thinking. Foundational for both fields are French theorist Michel Foucault’s histories of the social construction of categories such as body, gender, and sex that seem like natural phenomena. These categories form the basis for modern notions of subjectivity and power that conceive of the self as possessing a depth or interiority evident in the supposed natural truth of feelings (Foucault 1976/1990). Following this line of research, the affective turn takes up debates about the construction of binary oppositions between reason and emotion and the reversal of hierarchies that subordinate emotion to reason as part of a mind/body split often associated with the seventeenth-century philosopher René Descartes. In the Cartesian worldview, passions, instincts, and feelings are unruly and uncontrollable, requiring subordination to the rational control of reason and the mind—a hierarchical ordering that has sometimes led to a romantic embrace of their subversive power. In response to such reversals, Foucault’s critique of the idea that freedom of expression and resistance to repression constitutes political liberation has inspired cautionary accounts of the politics of affect. Efforts to historicize subjectivity and to conceive of the self in non-Cartesian terms have required new conceptions of affect, emotion, and feeling. Indeed, the use of the term “affect” rather than “feeling” or “emotion” arguably stems from the desire to find a more neutral word, given the strong vernacular associations of “feeling” and “emotion” with irrationality.</p>
<p>Within cultural studies, the project of accounting for social life and political economy through everyday and sensory experiences, including feelings, has an extensive history. Affect, emotion, and feeling have been central to long-standing efforts to combine Marxism and psychoanalysis and to theorize the relations between the psychic and the social, the private and the public. Psychoanalysis has used “affect” and related categories as part of a vocabulary for drives, unconscious processes, and the psychic energies created by both internal and external stimuli. The term “affect” is also present in social and cultural theories that seek alternatives to psychoanalytic models, such as Eve Sedgwick’s use of Sylvan Tompkins, who describes nine affects that link outward behavior with mental and physical states (Sedgwick and Frank 1995; Sedgwick 2003). Whether drawing on psychoanalysis or on its alternatives, accounts of psychic life and felt experience have been important to cultural studies in its efforts to explain the social and political uses of feeling (including the divide between reason and emotion) and to negotiate differences of scale between the local and the global, the intimate and the collective. Raymond Williams’s elusively suggestive term “structure of feeling” (1977/1997, 128–35) is a good example of the use of the vocabulary of feeling to describe how social conditions are manifest in everyday life and how felt experience can be the foundation for emergent social formations. Rather than being attached to one theoretical school or discipline, “affect” has named multiple projects and agendas, including broad inquiry into the public life of feelings. Following Williams, the vernacular term “feeling” remains a useful way to signify these projects, which extend beyond the question of specifying what affects are.</p>
<p>Though the affective turn has conceptual roots in Marxism and psychoanalysis, it has also been significantly catalyzed by feminist critiques of the gendering of dichotomies between reason and emotion, which made their way into the academy from popular culture and political movements. The 1970s feminist cultures of consciousness raising reversed the disparaging association of femininity with feeling and, in a version of the discourse of sexual revolution, celebrated emotional expression as a source of feminine power associated with social and political liberation (Sarachild 1978; Lorde 1984b). Subsequent generations of scholarship in feminist cultural studies have been more skeptical about an easy reversal of the reason/emotion binary, the often essentializing assumption that women are more emotional or nurturing than men, and claims for affective expression’s liberatory possibilities. Instead, this scholarship has provided rich and nuanced histories of the centrality of feeling to the relations between private and public spheres and especially of how the intimate life of romance, the family, and the domestic sphere serves as the foundation for social relations of power (Davidson and Hatcher 2002). In the field of American studies, scholarship on categories such as sentimentality, sensationalism, sympathy, melodrama, and the gothic has shown how cultural genres, especially fiction, produce social effects through mobilizing feeling (Tompkins 1985; S. Samuels 1992; Cvetkovich 1992; Halberstam 1995). Attention to affect is the culmination of several decades of feminist scholarship on clusters of related terms such as “domesticity,” “family,” and “marriage,” as well as on the historical continuities that link women’s popular genres, such as domestic and sentimental novels, theatrical melodrama, and women’s film (L. Williams 2002; Berlant 2008).</p>
<p>The far-reaching impact of feminist approaches to feeling and politics, including their relevance to histories of racism and colonialism, is exemplified by scholarship on the sentimental politics of abolition in texts such as Harriet Beecher Stowe’s <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> (1852/1981), nineteenth-century slave narratives, and contemporary neo-slave narratives. Stowe uses representations of slave mothers separated from their children and innocent slaves being beaten to generate appeals to universal feeling as the marker of the humanity of slaves and as the inherent result of witnessing the evils of slavery. Scenes of sexual intimacy between master and slave prove more affectively complex, however, in <em>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</em> (1861/2001), in which Harriet Jacobs grapples with how to represent her sexual relations with white men without losing the reader’s sympathy. Toni Morrison’s historical novel <em>Beloved</em> (1987) further challenges the tradition of the sympathetic slave mother by telling the story of a woman who tries to kill her three children in order to protect them from slavery, aiming for a more complex representation of the affective life of slavery than stark scenes of innocence and guilt. The powerful fusion of secular forms of religious feeling and maternal sentiment in abolitionist discourses provides a model for the representation of social suffering that has had a lasting impact on U.S. cultural politics in both popular entertainment and the news media. What Lauren Berlant (2008) has called the “unfinished business of sentimentality” persists not just in popular genres produced for women but also in realist and documentary forms of representation, including human rights discourses, in which spectacles of suffering are used to mobilize public action. Affectively charged representation is part of everyday life across the political spectrum, and images of political prisoners at Abu Ghraib, children of war, and unborn babies prompt ongoing debate about the politics of sensation, sentiment, and sympathy (Berlant 2004; Staiger, Cvetkovich, and Reynolds 2010).</p>
<p>Another important area of scholarship in which feeling and affect are central are discussions of trauma and cultural memory that have emerged in American studies as it reckons with the legacies of slavery, genocide, and colonialism. Although the urgencies of Holocaust memory have inspired the creation of public memorials and testimony as forums for emotional expression in Europe and elsewhere, slavery and genocide provide a specifically U.S. genealogy for trauma studies and cultural memory. In seeking to address traumatic histories, public cultures of memory raise questions about what emotional responses constitute a reparative relation to the past and whether it is ever possible to complete the work of mourning, particularly while social suffering is ongoing. Drawing on psychoanalytic categories of mourning and melancholy, critical race theory and queer studies (especially work on AIDS) have produced new theories of melancholy or unfinished mourning as productive rather than pathological. These fields depart from psychoanalytic categories of affect and trauma in favor of vernacular vocabularies of affect in indigenous, diasporic, and queer cultures (Crimp 2002; Eng and Kazanjian 2002; Cvetkovich 2003). Queer studies has also made important contributions to embracing ostensibly negative emotions such as shame and melancholy, as well as theorizing queer temporalities that favor affectively meaningful representations of the past rather than accurate or realist documentation (Love 2007; E. Freeman 2010).</p>
<p>While these critical histories of affect as a cultural and social construct have been extremely generative in American studies, a second important line of research has returned to theories of embodiment and sensation to ask new questions about the material basis for affect, emotions, and feelings. The use of the term “affect” by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari to describe the impersonal intensities, forces, and movements that cause bodies and objects to affect and be affected by one another has been especially influential in recent scholarship (Deleuze and Guattari 1987; Massumi 2002b; Stewart 2007; Puar 2007). Deleuze’s work usefully displaces psychoanalysis and decenters the individuated subject of cognition, locating unconscious bodily processes and sensory life at the center of social life. Deleuze has also been a major catalyst for new materialist notions of affect that distinguish more sharply between “affect” and “emotion,” preserving “affect” for noncognitive processes and using “emotion” to describe socially constructed behavior.</p>
<p>Clearly, the multidisciplinary question of what it means to be a sensory being cannot be confined to one theoretical school, and American studies and cultural studies have been invigorated by proliferating forms of affect studies. Phenomenology and cultural geography have provided resources for materialist histories of sensory experience as well as new accounts of the relations between bodies, objects, and environments and of terms such as “mood” and “atmosphere” (Ahmed 2006; Thrift 2008). Neurobiology and cognitive science have been embraced by scholars in the humanities interested in the interface between brain and body in constituting sensory experience, including reading and other forms of aesthetic and cultural reception (E. Wilson 2004; Zunshine 2006). Animal studies and ecocriticism contribute to a posthumanist concept of humans as integrated with animals, things, and nature and to understandings of affective experience as bodily sensation and vital force (Haraway 2008; Grosz 2011; J. Bennett 2010). With the project of overturning old hierarchies between mind and body, cognition and feeling, reason and emotion largely accomplished, affect studies is now promoting new interdisciplinary inquiry across science and humanities. In so doing, it offers answers to the long-standing problem in social theory of how to think the relation between the psychic and the social worlds and provides resources for building new cultures of public feeling.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The keyword “African” has been and remains a touchstone for African-descended peoples’ struggle for identity and inclusion, encompassing extremes of racial denigration and vindication in a nation founded on the enslavement of Africans. Both the African presence throughout the Americas and its significance for constructions of national culture in the United States have remained fraught with racialized and exclusionary power relations. In a nation that has traditionally imagined its culture and legislated its polity as “white,” “African” has often provided for African Americans a default basis for identity in direct proportion to their exclusion from national citizenship.</p>
<p>As scholars ranging from Winthrop Jordan (1969) to Jennifer L. Morgan (2004) have noted, there was nothing natural or inevitable about the development of racial slavery in the Americas. Nor was the emergence of the racialized category of the African as permanent slave foreordained. European travelers who recorded their initial encounters with Africans did not perceive them as slaves. But their ethnocentric self-regard informed their descriptions of Africans as extremely different from themselves in appearance, religious beliefs, and behavior. European constructions of the bodily difference, heathenism, and beastliness of Africans mitigated occasional observations of their morality and humanity. As European nations experimented with systems of forced labor in the Americas, initially enlisting indigenous peoples and European indentured servants as well as Africans, ideologies of African inferiority facilitated the permanent enslavement of Africans as an expedient labor practice. With the legal codification of lifetime African slavery, European settlers completed the racial degradation of African men and women, a process anticipated in Enlightenment conceptions of difference and hierarchy. In keeping with the contingency of its origins, the idea of the African in America was subject to change and contestation. An awareness on the part of travelers and slave owners of ethnic and regional distinctions among peoples from Africa yielded to the homogenizing idea of <em>the</em> African. Throughout the eighteenth century, slave owners in the Caribbean and North America attributed rebellions to “wild and savage” Africans, leading, on occasion, to restrictions on the importation of African slaves.</p>
<p>During the nineteenth century, free African Americans held an ambivalent attitude toward all things African. It could hardly have been otherwise, given the existential burdens of chattel slavery and the exclusion of Africa and its peoples from Enlightenment ideas of historical agency, modernity, and civilization. Prominent African Americans such as the shipping merchant Paul Cuffee championed emigration to West Africa. Despite his personal success, Cuffee despaired at the prospects for African-descended people to achieve equality in the United States. Inspired by the global antislavery movement, as well as the establishment of the British colony of Sierra Leone as an asylum for Africans rescued from the slave trade, Cuffee believed that emigration would allow Africans and African Americans to realize their full potential. But Cuffee led only one voyage of settlers to West Africa, leaving his entrepreneurial and evangelical objectives unfulfilled. African American enthusiasm for emigration was further dampened by the rise in the early nineteenth century of an explicitly racist colonization movement. The impetus for this movement, which sought the removal of free blacks and emancipated slaves to Africa, came from powerful whites, including slave owners and members of Congress.</p>
<p>Free blacks resented the proslavery motives of colonizationists and increasingly rejected an identification with Africa largely as a matter of self-defense. While the initial wave of schools, churches, mutual-aid societies, and other institutions established by northern free blacks in the late eighteenth century often bore the name “African,” this nomenclature was largely abandoned by the mid-nineteenth century. The reasons for this shift were complex, including demands for U.S. citizenship, black abolitionists’ opposition to the colonization movement, the dwindling population of African-born blacks, and an acknowledgment, at some level, of a multihued African American community resulting from the systemic rape of enslaved black women by white male slave owners. Above all, the term epitomized the stark conditions of exile faced by African Americans, excluded from U.S. citizenship and society and deprived of an affirming connection to an ancestral homeland. Even for leaders of the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, founded in Philadelphia in 1816 when white Methodists refused to worship alongside blacks, wariness toward Africa and a deep suspicion toward its indigenous cultures informed their efforts to evangelize the continent (J. Campbell 1995).</p>
<p>While emigration and colonization movements resulted in the resettlement of relatively few African Americans, the violent exclusion of African Americans from southern politics after emancipation renewed the appeal of Africa as a foundation of African American identity. As Africa came under the sway of European missions and colonialism, the involvement of AME Church missions in Africa and the scholarship of Edward W. Blyden (1887/1967) helped promote among some African Americans a general interest in the welfare of Africans and a greater tolerance for indigenous African cultures. Blyden’s work was part of a long-standing African American intellectual tradition seeking to vindicate Africa by documenting its contributions to Western civilization (Moses 1998). Such scholarship, combined with the worldwide impact of Marcus Garvey’s post–World War I mass movement, helped sow the seeds of African nationalism and anticolonialism. The Garvey movement, which ﬂourished amid a national wave of urban race riots and antiblack violence, built on popular emigrationism and inspired African-descended peoples all over the world with its secular gospel of economic cooperation toward African redemption, even as some African American intellectuals dismissed it as a quixotic “back to Africa” movement. Such controversy may well have informed subsequent debates among black studies scholars over whether it was valid to speak of African cultural retentions, or “survivals,” among the descendants of enslaved Africans in the Americas. The sociologist E. Franklin Frazier and the social anthropologist Melville Herskovits represent the opposing positions in the debate (Raboteau 1978). Frazier believed that the traumas of enslavement and the rigors of urbanization had extinguished all cultural ties to Africa. Herskovits based his support for the idea of African cultural retentions on his research on Caribbean societies and cultural practices. If recent scholarship in history, anthropology, linguistics, religion, literary and cultural studies, historical archaeology, and population genetics is any indication, Herskovits’s position that some African cultural practices persisted in the Americas appears to have prevailed.</p>
<p>As African national independence movements capitalized on the decline of European colonialism after World War II, the idea of the African underwent yet another profound revision in the minds of many African Americans, from intellectual and popular stereotypes of African savagery to images of black power and modernity. The emergence of newly independent African nations beginning in the late 1950s became a source of pride for many people of African descent. Even as blacks believed that the new African presence in world affairs signaled the continent’s full participation in, if not redefinition of, the modern world, members of the U.S. and European political establishment opposed African demands for freedom and true self-determination, trafficking, more or less discreetly, in racist attitudes. In 1960, widely touted as “the year of Africa,” more than thirty African states gained national independence; that year also witnessed the bloody repression of demands for freedom in apartheid South Africa and the Congo. For many northern urban African Americans a generation removed from the violence of the Jim Crow South and facing marginalization in such cities as New York, Chicago, and Detroit, new African states and their leaders, including Ghana’s Kwame Nkrumah and the Congo’s Patrice Lumumba, rivaled the southern civil rights movement in importance. When Lumumba was assassinated during the civil disorder in the Congo fomented by Belgium, African Americans in Harlem and Chicago angrily demonstrated against the complicity of Western governments and the United Nations in the murder. In doing so, they joined members of the black left and working-class black nationalists in a nascent political formation that envisioned their U.S. citizenship in solidarity with African peoples, uniting their own demands for freedom and democracy in the United States with those of peoples of African descent the world over (Singh 2004; Gaines 2006).</p>
<p>Within this context of decolonization, the term “African” became a battleground. To the architects of U.S. foreign policy, African American solidarity with African peoples and their struggles exceeded the ideological boundaries of U.S. citizenship. African American criticism of U.S. foreign policy and advocacy on behalf of African peoples transgressed the limits imposed by a liberalism whose expressed support for civil rights and decolonization was qualified by Cold War national security concerns (and opposed outright by segregationist elements). As some African governments joined U.S. blacks in denouncing violent white resistance to demands for equality, U.S. officials’ assertions of the American Negro’s fundamental Americanness became a staple of liberal discourse. Their view was echoed in press accounts asserting that Africans and American Negroes were fundamentally estranged from one another. No doubt many African Americans still looked on Africans with ambivalence. However, this normative, liberal, and assimilationist notion of African American identity and citizenship provided a context for subsequent debates among African Americans during the Black Power era of the late 1960s and beyond over the terms of an authentic black identity. Contested claims about authentic blackness, particularly when inflected with issues of gender and sexual orientation, can and have had a divisive and self-destructive impact among African Americans (E. Johnson 2003).</p>
<p>As a Janus-faced U.S. nationalism trumpeted its civil rights reforms—seemingly in exchange for consent to its political and military repression of African and, in the 1960s, Vietnamese nationalists—mainstream civil rights leaders endeavored, without success, to formalize an African American position on U.S. foreign policy. It was Malcolm X, among African American spokespersons, who most effectively articulated a growing frustration with the federal government’s domestic and foreign policies toward black and African peoples (Gaines 2006). Along with such post–World War II figures as Paul Robeson, St. Clair Drake, and Lorraine Hansberry, Malcolm X reanimated W. E. B. Du Bois’s decades-old assertion that African Americans sought no less than full U.S citizenship without sacrificing their “Negro” identity and heritage, helping African Americans to embrace rather than shun the designation “African” (Plummer 1996; Von Eschen 1997; Meriwether 2002).</p>
<p>During the 1980s, African American leadership, including many elected officials, waged an effective civil disobedience campaign against the apartheid regime in South Africa and the Reagan administration’s support for it. The rapid acceptance of the term “African American,” championed by Jesse Jackson and others and used in the context of the antiapartheid struggle, represents a profound reversal of decades of shame and ambivalence. Yet it is unclear what relationship the general (though by no means universal) acceptance of “African” as a marker of U.S. black identity today bears to the black transnational consciousness that developed during the 1960s and that ﬂourished during the Free South Africa movement. A major legacy of these social movements for black equality and African liberation has been the legitimation of scholarly investigations of the African foundations of African American history and culture, including studies of the African diaspora and what Paul Gilroy (1993) has termed the “Black Atlantic.”</p>
<p>At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the term “African” remains highly contested in politics and popular culture. On the one hand, crises of poverty, famine, disease (including the AIDS epidemic), and armed conﬂict reinforce an Afro-pessimism in the Western imagination not far removed from the colonial idea of the “Dark Continent,” a place untouched by civility and modernity. While the human toll of such crises is undeniable, the U.S. media generally devote far less attention to democratically elected civilian governments, some of which have supplanted brutal and corrupt military dictatorships supported by the West during the Cold War. These representations continue to view Africans and African Americans through alternately romanticizing and demeaning prisms of race.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the term “African” has come full circle within a society capable of sustaining wildly contradictory views of race. Apart from the usual Afro-pessimism, the African has been incorporated in some accounts into the quintessential U.S. immigrant success narrative, as the upward mobility of highly educated African immigrants is portrayed as an implicit reproach to underachieving native-born African American descendants of slaves. The idea of the otherness of African immigrants in relation to the native-born U.S. black community was widely debated during the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama. Some African American pundits asserted that Obama’s African parentage made him less authentically black than U.S.-born African Americans descended from slaves and, arguably, less entitled to the black vote than his rival in the Democratic primary in 2008, Hillary Rodham Clinton. This view was discredited as Obama’s candidacy gained momentum and as African Americans equated Obama’s run for the presidency with African Americans’ historical struggles for equality. Obama’s election was celebrated internationally, including throughout Africa and in the Kenyan village of his father’s family. As the first African American president, Obama has faced an unusual level of attacks to his person and the dignity of his office, often of a blatantly racist nature. Right-wing pundits and politicians routinely portray Obama’s African heritage as a threat to the republic; Newt Gingrich, during his 2012 run for the presidency, claimed that Obama’s “Kenyan, anti-colonial” worldview was proof of his disloyalty and subversive influence (Costa 2010).</p>
<p>Whatever their origin or occasion, media and political narratives emphasizing tensions between African Americans and African immigrants are the present-day equivalent of Tarzan movies, whose effect is to erase the history and modernity of transnational black subjectivities. While recent scholarship in American studies has called for a rethinking of the black-white color line in U.S. race relations, the tensions expressed by the question of who is an “African” and who is an “African American” are symptomatic of the nation’s continued struggle over the significance of the African presence, past and present, real and symbolic. Of course, the contested meaning and legacy of the African presence is not peculiar to the United States, as many Latino immigrants to the United States bring with them histories and identities shaped by the vexed legacy of racial slavery in their countries of origin. The foundations of Latin American societies, with their diverse populations of Africans, indigenous peoples, Europeans, and Asians, suggests that the expansion of the Hispanic population in the United States does not render the black-white color line obsolete but rather makes it all the more salient as a benchmark for social affiliation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“We hold these truths to be self-evident,” begins the main body of the Declaration of Independence, and the definition of “America” may likewise seem utterly self-evident: the short form of the nation’s official name. Yet the meaning of this well-worn term becomes more elusive the closer we scrutinize it. Since “America” names the entire hemisphere from the Yukon to Patagonia, its common use as a synonym for the United States of America is technically a misnomer, as Latin Americans and Canadians continually (if resignedly) point out. Given the nearly universal intelligibility of this usage, their objection may seem a small question of geographical semantics. But “America” carries multiple connotations that go far beyond the literal referent of the nation-state. In the statement “As Americans, we prize freedom,” “American” may at first seem to refer simply to U.S. citizens, but the context of the sentence strongly implies a consensual understanding of shared values, not just shared passports; the literal and figurative meanings tend to collapse into each other. The self-evidence of “America” is thus troubled from the start by multiple ambiguities about the extent of the territory it delineates, as well as about its deeper connotations.</p>
<p>Seeking out the meaning of America might be said to be a national characteristic, if that proposition were not in itself tautological. The question prompts responses representing every conceivable point of view, from the documentary series packaged as <em>Ken Burns’s America</em> (1996) to prize-winning essays by schoolchildren invited to tackle this hoary topic. Foodways, cultural practices, and even consumer products are readily made to symbolize the nation’s essence (“baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, and Chevrolet,” as a highly effective advertising campaign put it in the 1970s). Such metonyms gesture, in turn, at more abstract notions: Freedom, Liberty, Democracy. Whether implicit or explicit, responses to the enigma of Americanness tend to obscure the conditions under which they were formulated. Who gets to define what “America” means? What institutions help enforce or undermine a particular definition? Under what historical conditions does one group’s definition have more or less power than another’s? Without looking critically at these questions of nomenclature, “American” studies cannot claim self-awareness about its premises or its practices.</p>
<p>Because the meaning of “America” and its corollaries—“American,” “Americanization,” “Americanism,” and “Americanness”—seems so self-evident but is in fact so imprecise, using the term in conversation or debate tends to reinforce certain ways of thinking while repressing others. In the slyly comic <em>Devil’s Dictionary</em> (1911), pundit Ambrose Bierce includes the term only in the form of its opposite: “un-American, adj. Wicked, intolerable, heathenish.” If using the adjective “un-American” shuts down genuine argument by impugning your opponent’s values, as Bierce implies, then the power to define what does count as “American” is a considerable one.</p>
<p>By the time Bierce penned this undefinition, the use of “America” as a synonym for “the United States” was a habit already deeply ingrained, thanks in part to nationalistic writers of the nineteenth century, such as Walt Whitman. Whitman’s original preface to <em>Leaves of Grass</em> tries to get at the essence of the nation by using both terms in rapid-fire succession: “The genius of the United States is not best or most in its executives or legislatures, nor in its ambassadors or authors or colleges or churches or parlors, . . . but always most in the common people.” “America is the race of races,” he continues. “The Americans of all nations at any time upon the earth have probably the fullest poetical nature. The United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem” (1855/1999, 4–5). Whitman’s vision of America / the United States celebrates “the common people,” the heterogeneous mixing of immigrants into a “race of races,” and everyday, vernacular speech as the stuff of poetry. Yet Whitman also includes scenes from Mexico, Canada, and the Caribbean in his panoramic vision of America, revealing not only the expansionist beliefs Whitman held at the time but the extraordinary persistence of this older sense of America as the name for the whole of the New World (another misnomer sanctified by the passage of time, since millions of indigenous inhabitants neither saw it as new nor imagined it on the abstract scale of the Europeans).</p>
<p>Against Columbus’s insistence that the landmass he had “discovered” was Asia, the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci first dubbed it a “New World” in his treatise by that name. It was not Vespucci himself but a contemporary mapmaker, Martin Waldseemuller, who then christened the region “America,” originally referring only to the southern continent. Later cartographers broadened the designation to include the lesser-known north—a further irony of history. To this day, alternative theories of the naming of the hemisphere ﬂourish, finding new devotees on the Internet. Solid evidence links a British merchant named Richard Ameryk to John Cabot’s voyages along the North Atlantic coast, leading to speculation that Cabot named “America” for his patron a decade or so before Waldseemuller’s map. Others have argued that the name comes from Vikings who called their Newfoundland settlement “Mark” or “Maruk”—“Land of Darkness.” Still others have claimed, more circumstantially, that the root word derives from Phoenician, Hebrew, or Hindu terms, suggesting that one of these groups encountered America before Europeans did. Similar etymological evidence has been interpreted to show that the term ultimately stems from a word for Moors or Africans, so that “America” really means “land of the blacks.” “America” is thus a product of the same misunderstanding that gave us the term “Indian.” Given this similarity, one final theory about the term’s origins is particularly provocative. An indigenous group in Nicaragua had referred to one gold-rich district in their territory as “Amerrique” since before the Conquest, and Mayan languages of tribes further north use a similar-sounding word (Jonathan Cohen 2004). These discoveries have led to the radical proposition that the name “America” comes from within the New World rather than being imposed on it. The continuing life of this debate suggests that what is really at stake is not some ultimate etymological truth but a narrative of shared origins; each claim grants primacy and symbolic (if not literal) ancestry of the Americas to a different group.</p>
<p>The fact that only one of these fables of the origin of the word “America” involves an indigenous name is revealing. Throughout the colonies, settlers tended not to refer to themselves as “Americans,” since the term then conveyed an indigenous ancestry—or at least the associated taint of barbarism and backwardness—that they were (with certain romanticizing exceptions) eager to avoid. Instead, they nostalgically called their home spaces “New-England,” “Nieuw-Amsterdam,” and “Nueva España,” reﬂecting the fact that, for most people, local identities took precedence over larger, abstract ones: a problem that the architects of nationhood eventually had to solve. There were some exceptions, however. The sixteenth-century Dominican priest Bartolomé de las Casas initiated an argument that raged across both Americas over whether Vespucci had usurped an honor rightly due Columbus; he proposed rechristening the region “Columba,” and many place-names in Latin America pay homage accordingly. Las Casas gained a considerable following in the English-speaking world, and two of the most powerful writers of the later Puritan period, Samuel Sewall and Cotton Mather, recorded their wish to evangelize the whole of the New World so that it would “deserve the significant name of <em>Columbina</em>” (Sewall 1697/1997, 59). Mather even went so far as to describe himself as an “American” in the introduction to his historical chronicle <em>Magnalia Christi Americana</em> in 1702, well before the national sense of the term was even imaginable. Until the beginning of the nineteenth century, then, “America” and its analogs in Spanish, French, and other European languages designated the whole of the New World. Of the many figurative meanings that the American hemisphere has acquired over time, most involve notions of novelty, new beginnings, and utopian promise.</p>
<p>The Mexican historian Edmundo O’Gorman (1961) inﬂuentially wrote that America was “invented” before it was “discovered,” demonstrating that Europeans had long imagined a mythical land of marvels and riches that they then projected onto the unfamiliar terrain. After Columbus, earlier Christian models of a three-continent globe were amended to include America as the fourth. To create two-dimensional representations of a world now known to be round, Renaissance mapmakers split the globe visually into distinct hemispheres—Europe, Africa, and Asia as the Eastern, and the Americas isolated into the Western. This geographical convenience has become so naturalized that it remains difficult for us to envision, for instance, the interlinked world of the Pacific Rim or the proximity of the points on the transatlantic triangle trade of slaves, sugar, and rum. Similarly, the idea of “Latin America”—comprising not just the continent of South America but a hefty portion of North America as well—is a product of cultural practices rather than any innate geophysical reality: in the nineteenth century, Spanish-speaking elites began using the term to defend and distinguish Franco-Iberian Catholic values from Anglo-Saxon Protestant ones. As Walter Mignolo writes, “Once America was named as such in the sixteenth century and Latin America named as such in the nineteenth, it appeared as if they had been there forever” (2005, 2).</p>
<p>The associations that Europeans projected onto this “new” hemisphere were not always positive, even though the wealth of the American colonies was absolutely vital to the historical shifts we associate with modernization. The common representation of a “virgin land” waiting to be explored, dominated, and domesticated relegates the natural world to the passive, inferior position then associated with the feminine. The French naturalist George Louis Leclerc de Buffon even argued in 1789 that since the region was geologically newer, its very ﬂora and fauna were less developed than Europe’s—a claim Thomas Jefferson (1787/1984) took pains to refute, using examples from South as well as North America. Nonetheless, the notion of the novelty of the Americas persisted, extending to the supposedly immature culture of its inhabitants as well.</p>
<p>Early debates over literature and fine arts in the English, Spanish, and French Americas all focused on the question of whether the residents of a land without history could cultivate a genuine or original aesthetic. Some Romantic writers tried on Indian themes, while others spun this “historylessness” in America’s favor. The philosopher G. W. F. Hegel delivered an inﬂuential address in 1830 that claimed, “America is therefore the land of the future, where, in all the ages that lie before us, the burden of the World’s History shall reveal itself—perhaps in a contest between North and South America. It is a land of desire for all those who are weary of the historical lumber-room of old Europe” (1837/1956, 86). (Note that Hegel still uses “America” to indicate the whole region, not just the United States.) Claims about the New World’s salvational role in global history, then, gestated from without as well as from within. Sewall and Mather’s wish to elevate Columbus over Vespucci was revived after the Revolutionary War in the iconographic figure of the goddess Columbia. In the hands of artists and poets, this imaginary female figure lent a tinge of classical refinement to the nation-building project; the African American Phillis Wheatley (1775/2001) penned one of the very first poems to deploy this image. The figure of Columbia was quite popular during the century that followed, prompting patriotic musings on “the Columbian ideal” as well as events such as the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, calculated to draw international attention to a nation that increasingly celebrated modernity and progress. Voluptuous Columbia continued to appear on coins into the early twentieth century, but there is no contemporary visual icon that corresponds allegorically to the name “America.”</p>
<p>It was perhaps inevitable that the hazy ideas projected so persistently onto the name of the hemisphere and, subsequently, the U.S. nation would spawn other coinages to describe dynamic social processes. “Americanism” and “Americanization” had entered common usage by the beginning of the nineteenth century, referring at first to evolving linguistic differences from the English spoken in Great Britain but expanding their connotations into the general realm of culture. “Americanization” became an everyday word at the turn of the twentieth century, a period of surging immigration, signifying the degree to which those immigrants altered their customs and values in accordance with the dominant view of Americanness at the time. It remains to be seen whether the “Americanization” of immigrants can absorb new meanings beyond this model of one-way assimilation.</p>
<p>Given the long-standing tendency to define America in mythic terms, we must be skeptical of the common boast that the United States is the only modern nation founded on an idea—democratic equality—rather than on a shared tribal or racial ancestry. Such a claim to exceptionalism has been particularly appealing to intellectuals, who traffic in ideas. In the early years of American studies as an academic discipline in the 1950s, the field’s foundational texts located the essential meaning of “America” variously in the history of westward movement, in philosophical and economic individualism, or in the privileging of the future oriented and the new. As the discipline has evolved, it has increasingly attempted to show how such mythic definitions arise in response to historically specific needs and conditions. When we go in search of what is most profoundly American, scholars now insist, we blinker our sights to the ways in which the actual history of U.S. actions and policies may have diverged from those expectations. Moreover, any single response to the prompt to define “America” (meaning the nation-state, not the continent) tends to imply that this larger idea or ideal has remained essentially unchanged over time, transcending ethnic and racial differences. From the nineteenth century forward, “America” and its derivations have generally been used to consolidate, homogenize, and unify, rather than to invite recognition of difference, dissonance, and plurality.</p>
<p>Since the 1990s, interdisciplinary work in American studies has mainly focused on illustrating the ways in which “American national identity is . . . constructed in and through relations of difference,” as one former president of the American Studies Association put it (Radway 2002, 54). She went so far as to suggest that the organization rename itself in response to challenges raised around the time of Columbus’s quincentenary by proponents of an “Americas” or “New World” studies. Such a transnational approach would revive the hemispheric scale of America and consider U.S. cultural productions and social formations in relation to those of Latin America, the Caribbean, and Canada. Rather than Alexis de Tocqueville and Michel Crèvecoeur, its canon of commentators on the meaning of “America” highlights lesser-known figures such as the Cuban José Martí—who in an 1891 speech famously distinguished between “Nuestra” (Our) America, with its mestizo or mixed-race origins, and the racist, profit-driven culture he saw dominating the United States. Martí, like the later activist-writers of African origin W. E. B. Du Bois and C. L. R. James, was critical of the growing interventionist tendencies of the United States in the Western Hemisphere and sought to shift the connotations of the term in provocative ways. In addition to recovering such underappreciated thinkers, comparative Americanist work often locates its inquiry in spaces once relegated to the periphery of scholarly attention, such as the Spanish-speaking borderlands that were formerly part of Mexico. As contact zones between North and South, Anglo and Latino, such areas produce hybrid cultural formations that inﬂect mainstream U.S. culture with that of the “other” America.</p>
<p>Undoing what most Latin Americans see as an imperial arrogation of the name of the hemisphere by the most powerful nation in it has been central to the project of a pluralized, relational Americas studies. Bell Gale Chevigny and Gari Laguardia, in the preface to their landmark essay collection <em>Reinventing the Americas</em>, write that “by dismantling the U.S. appropriation of the name ‘America,’ we will better see what the United States is and what it is not” (1986, viii). The work of divorcing the names that Whitman (and others) wedded together so powerfully has stumbled a bit on the lack of a ready adjectival form in English. A few writers, such as the late Chicano scholar Juan Bruce-Novoa (2004), have recalled into service the neologism that Frank Lloyd Wright coined in the 1930s to describe his nonderivative, middle-class house designs: “Usonian.” Others, including Chevigny and Laguardia, simply substitute “U.S.” or “United Statesian” for “American,” arguing that the very awkwardness of such terms has a certain heuristic value, recalling us to a historical moment before the pressure toward consensus and national unity became as pervasive as it is today.</p>
<p>Perhaps such consciousness raising about the power of “self-evident” terms could indeed begin the slow work of altering social relationships and structures of political power. Yet the plural form of “Americas” and the seemingly more inclusive geography of North America have found their way into some political formations that reinforce, rather than challenge, U.S. hegemony in the hemisphere—such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the U.S. Army School of the Americas, a military training center for Latin Americans whose graduates were implicated in multiple cases of human rights violations in the 1980s and 1990s (and which was subsequently renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation). In these examples, the seemingly more inclusive term works opportunistically rather than critically, suggesting that in the future, the usage of “Americas” may require the same kind of scrutiny that we have just brought to “America.”</p>

<p>“Orientals are carpets!” is a common Asian American retort today, one that rejects the linkage between objects of desire—whether hand-woven carpets made in central and western Asia or porcelains made in China—and the people who make them. During the late-1960s phase of the civil rights movement, second- and third-generation, college-age, mainly Chinese and Japanese Americans from the United States and Canada protested the term “Oriental,” seeking to replace it with the seemingly less fraught term “Asian.” But as in any debate about naming practices, the names rejected and defended reﬂect differing points of view, as groups trouble certain terms and adopt others in order to shape and reshape meanings for themselves. “Asia,” “Asian,” and “Asiatic” are still common, though the latter is far less preferred. Variations such as “Asianic,” “Asiaticism,” “Asiatise,” “Asiatall,” “Asiatican,” and “Asiatically” are now archaic.</p>
<p>Each of these terms comes loaded with particular spatial orientations rooted in temporal relationships. “Asia” has Arabic, Aramaic, Ethiopian, and Greek origins signifying “was or became beautiful,” “to rise” (said of the sun), “burst forth” or “went out,” and “to go out.” Demetrius J. Georgacas (1969, 33) speculates that “Asia” comes from the ancient Greeks, who adopted a cuneiform Hittite word <em>assuva </em>when traveling to the western shores of Anatolia (present-day Turkish Asia) around 1235 BCE. <em>Assuva</em>, in turn, may have originally been a pre-Persian name referring to a town in Crete with an ancient temple to Zeus or a “land or country with good soil” (73–75). Georgacas adds that Greek mariners first articulated a nautical boundary between the lands of the rising sun and those of the setting sun by traversing the saltwater straits of the Aegean through the Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmara, the Bosphorus, the Black Sea through the Straits of Kerch, and ending in the Sea of Azov, where the landmass to the north did not have such a divide (11–12). Hence “Asia” as “east” began as a local definition.</p>
<p>Asia in these contexts appeared as separated by water from the Greek world, leading to the inaccurate <em>idée fixe</em> of a separable landmass and people. The categorization of continents that emerged from this idea reproduced early notions of racial superiority and inferiority. By the fifth century CE, “Asiatic” was clearly associated with vulgarity, arbitrary authority, and luxurious splendor—qualities deemed antithetical to Greek values (Hay 1957, 3). An early eleventh-century “T-O” map reveals a clear religious cosmos of the world. A “T” within a circle divides three continents: Asia, marked “oriens,” is over Europe and Africa (or Libya), which are both marked “occidens.” The “T” itself represented both a Christian cross and the Nile River, believed by some people to be the divide between Africa, Asia, and the Mediterranean (ibid., plate 1b, 54). Noah’s sons, Japheth, Shem, and Ham, were said to have dispersed to Europe, Asia, and Africa, respectively, thereby fixing their characters to geographic spaces. For Western Christians, the Ottoman Empire to the east was formidable. As their city-states became more secular and colonized non-Christian lands westward, northward, and southward, Renaissance intellectuals redefined “civilization” and “progress” as moving westward like the arc of the sun. A double shift took place: the West became synonymous with Christianity, and Western ideologues claimed direct continuity with Greek civilization.</p>
<p>In this centuries-long process, the appropriation of the word “Europe” for this Western Christian political culture also projected the imagined heathenism affixed to peoples onto the continents of “Asia” and “Africa.” Intercultural inﬂuences that produced overlapping renaissances in the Mediterranean world were appropriated as <em>the </em>(one and only) Renaissance, at once Eurocentric and colonizing. Taxonomist Carolus Linnaeus (1735) formulated “four races of mankind,” from primitive Africans to civilized Europeans, with Asians or “Mongoloids” said to be the “semi-civilized” peoples of once-great material civilizations now stiﬂed by despotic rulers. The formulation by Karl Marx (1867/1976) of “the Asiatic mode of production” as despotic bore the assumptions of this worldview. The rising European and colonial middle classes desired Asian goods, with their cachet of luxury, opulence, and decadence—a practice emulating the European courts’ consumption fashions. Yet this fascination was also laced by threat. Startled by Japan’s swift defeat of China, Kaiser Wilhelm II first dreamed of an impending “yellow peril” in 1895. The <em>Fu Manchu </em>novels of Sax Rohmer (Arthur Sarsfield Ward) soon followed, selling millions of copies throughout the twentieth century and popularizing representations of the “Near East,” as ascribed by self-named “Occidentists,” as utterly opposite and alien to the European self (Said 1978). This alterity was both derisive and romantic, coding “Asian” difference as gendered and sexualized. French Orientalists, for example, were fascinated by the eroticism of Persian <em>odalisques</em>, such as those represented in Jean-León Gérôme’s paintings. This alterity enabled the self-delusional Eurocentric myth of a singular Western modernity: “In adopting the name ‘Europe’ as a substitute for Western Christendom, the Modern Western World had replaced a misnomer that was merely an anachronism by a misnomer that was seriously misleading” (Georgacas 1969, 29).</p>
<p>This misnaming has a long history. In 1507, German mapmaker Martin Waldseemuller named “America” after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci’s charting of South America. At that moment, a fourth continent upset the tripartite “T-O” map, and the Americas became the place where populations—indigenous, Africans, Europeans, and Asians—intermingled. Spanish colonials established the Manila–Acapulco trade from 1565 to 1815, bringing Filipinos/as, Chinese, and other “Asians” to the “New World.” By 1635, Chinese barbers were reportedly monopolizing the trade in Mexico City. Chinese silk shawls and other desired goods traveled the Camino Real north to Santa Fe. Filipino sailors resettled in the French colonial lands of Louisiane. As the northeastern ports of the newly established United States began direct trade with China in 1784, people, goods, and inﬂuences crisscrossed with ports of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Yet with Euro-American colonization, transplanted Eurocentric ideas of “Asia,” “the Orient,” and “the East” were reproduced ever further westward. The more the people of the Americas shared this Eurocentrism, the more their national identities proved to be a variation of white <em>herrenvolk </em>nationalism.</p>
<p>Despite this long genealogy, “Asian” bodies in the Americas have been viewed as phenotypically foreign—a demarcation of otherness as foundational as the “T-O” map. “Far Eastern” bodies, ideas, and things were mapped onto existent binaries of “Near Eastern” Orientalism. Anglo-American phrases emerged, such as “the yellow peril,” “Mongoloid idiot,” and “Asiatic hordes,” along with names for diseases such as “Asiatic cholera” and the omnipresent “Asian ﬂu.” “Asiatics” were portrayed as threatening and inferior to white Euro-American masculinity. The Asian American critique of stereotypes is useful here. Writer-critics Jeffrey Paul Chan and Frank Chin (1972) have delineated “racist hate” as what most U.S. Americans imagine anti-Asian racism to be and “racist love” as the affections formed by the dominant culture toward those Asians who conform to stereotype. The exotic-erotic lotus-blossom geisha, for example, is the object of Orientalist desire—an extension of the <em>odalisque</em>. And detective Charlie Chan always solved the white man’s mystery with good humble humor. At the same time, white, straight, male control has been repulsed (and titillated) by the dominatrix Dragon Lady type or “the devil incarnate” Fu Manchu role.</p>
<p>Contemporary U.S. notions of “terrorism” are undergirded by such stereotypical structures of thought. When media mogul Henry R. Luce (1941) celebrated the “American Century” as a mid-twentieth-century enlightenment project for the world, the primary area of U.S. economic and political expansion was westward into the Pacific. For 170 years, U.S. military actions and wars in the Pacific Rim have been justified by national security and self-interest. The Asia Pacific War, usually understood as a response to Japan’s expansionism and efforts to formulate an “Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere,” might be better understood in this broader context of competition for Pacific and Asian resources and markets. Historian William Appleman Williams (1992) charted the linkages between U.S. western expansionism and U.S. “foreign” policy annexations into the Pacific. “Manifest Destiny” did not stop at the shores of California. A list of U.S. military, diplomatic, and trade initiatives clearly delineates deep, sustained U.S. involvements in the Asia Pacific region. Witness the U.S. involvement in the British-led opium trade and wars with China (1830s), Commodore Perry’s “opening” of Japan (1853), the annexation of Hawai‘i, Guam, and the Philippines (1898) and Samoa (1900), the countless military actions of the twentieth century establishing strategic military bases, and the early twenty-first-century battle with the “Axis of Evil.”</p>
<p>Military actions, missionary work, and trade, along with labor recruitment and immigration policies, linked the fate of Asians and Pacific Islanders in the United States to national foreign policy in Asia and the Pacific. Liberation movements necessarily became critiques of U.S. expansionism and self-interest, while policies toward Asia and the Pacific were articulated to domestic civil rights. The Harvard historian and adviser to the U.S. war against Japan Edwin O. Reischauer is one example. He urged improved treatment of interned Japanese Americans to counter Imperial Japan’s criticism of Western racism and imperialism—the primary argument for developing a pan-Asian and pan-Pacific Japanese-controlled “prosperity” confederation. While pan-Asianism has mainly been identified with the reactionary expansionism of the Japanese empire, it is important to note that there have been many moments when pan-Asian ideas and actions emerged from revolutionary nationalists—often adapting U.S. ideals of freedom and liberty. Tokyo in the 1900s brought together many left-leaning Chinese and Koreans with Japanese socialists; anarchists and various radicals gathered in Paris before World War I; and the Bandung Conference in 1955 articulated an Asian and African “Third World” unity. These movements have argued for multiple modernities, not one singular “Western” path. The ongoing post-civil-rights-era “culture wars” have cast Asian American and other identity-based rights movements as a de facto “Balkanizing” of Euro-America (Schlesinger 1998; Huntington 2004b). More progressive scholars argue for the ongoing struggle to expand the meaning of “we, the people” and “the American experiment” at home and democracy and human rights abroad.</p>
<p>Given this long and complex history, the challenges for American studies and cultural studies scholarship and practice are numerous. A thorough critique of Eurocentric knowledge needs to continue and to be extended into curricula. As Naoki Sakai (2000) insists, modernity needs to be pluralized to recognize multiple paths for a people’s development. Those who have experienced disempowerment and marginalization help us understand and gain insight into the ways reality is constructed and policies are formulated. This insight, when cultivated with deeper historical, cultural, social, and political analysis, restructures what we understand and how we understand it. In addition, it enables the recognition and translation of diverse and dynamic economic, cultural, and political developments in various parts of “east,” “southeast,” “south,” “central,” and “western” Asia (all these directional terms are partial and misleading). This rethinking can begin with the available literature of those Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Asian Americans writing and being translated into English but must be extended to help U.S. Americans understand the local struggles of grain farmers in Kazakhstan or female Nike factory workers in Bangladesh in terms truthful to those people’s own worldviews. This requires dialogue and the insistence that disempowered peoples gain the capacity to “name” their own world.</p>
<p>How the United States and various Asian governments respond to the political-economic rivalries of the “New World Order” will frame the spaces in which this scholarship and activism can take place. Calls for pan-Asianism, used in various ways in different places and at different times, can contribute to a process that opens up participation and grassroots mobilizations, or they can serve to close down understanding by offering simplistic solutions to complex political-economic questions. Uneven development and hierarchical knowledges challenge us to better imagine and work for a fair and equitable global vision. “Development” and “modernization” must be reformulated to produce sustainable local practices without romanticizing a prelapsarian past. Here, feminists, labor activists, and students who have access to both local and particular knowledges and transnational networks, via the Internet, have led the way, while ambitious corporate power players from “developing nations” and peoples have become the new comprador managers of internationalizing North American, European, and Asian finance capital. The contestation of values and meanings is critical to our future collective well-being. Like other keywords of these globalized struggles, it is the fate of “Asian” to be contested locally and regionally—in contending, politicized practices of naming.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The word “black” has a long and vexed history both inside and outside the United States. Typically used as a neutral reference to the darkest color on the spectrum, the word has also taken on negative cultural and moral meanings. It describes both something that is “soiled,” “stained,” “evil,” or “morally vapid” and people of a darker hue. The <em>American Heritage Dictionary</em> provides a typical example of this dual usage. One of the entries under “black” as an adjective is “gloomy, pessimistic, dismal,” while another is “of or belonging to a racial group having brown to black skin, especially one of African origin: <em>the Black population of South Africa</em>.” The slippage in the latter definition from “brown to black” highlights the ways in which the term’s negative cultural and moral connotations are racialized through reference to not-quite-white but also not-always-black bodies. This slippage maintains hierarchies among the races scaled from white to black. While the origin of this mixed usage of the term “black” is hard to pin down, negative associations of cultural and moral blackness with dark-skinned people appear regularly during the Renaissance, as in Shakespeare’s play <em>Othello</em>, in which the dark-skinned protagonist of the same name is referred to as a “Barbary horse” and a “lascivious Moor.” Over time and in opposition to the dominant discourses of their historical moments, people who belonged to these racialized groups have often followed Othello’s lead by reappropriating the term “black” to signify something culturally and morally empowering and, in some instances, a quality superior to whiteness.</p>
<p>As this brief overview suggests, the adjective “black” is, in the words of the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>, “a word of difficult history.” Part of that difficulty has to do with the various geographical and historical contexts of its usage. In relation to U.S. slavery, the term was not as prominent a descriptor for enslaved Africans as were the derogatory “nigger” or the seemingly more benign “Negro” and “colored.” After emancipation, the term “black” gained increased prominence in the legal and political realms as the 1865 “black codes” were enacted to restrict the rights of the newly freed by reinforcing white supremacy during Reconstruction (Meier and Rudwick 1976). For the people directly affected by those codes, the term “black” still did not hold as much political weight as “Negro” and “colored” until later in the twentieth century. The result is that “black” was not used in the names of the political organizations that emerged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), founded in 1895, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), founded in 1909.</p>
<p>The now common “African American” (or hyphenated “African-American”) has a similarly complex history. It did not become a popular term until almost a century later, in the late 1980s. A black army veteran from Alabama by the name of Johnny Duncan claims that he was the first to use the term in his poem “I Can,” which he wrote for a 1987 Black History Month calendar. In the last four lines of the poem, Duncan writes, “The last 4 letters of my heritage and my creed spell ‘I can,’ heritage being Afr-i-can and creed being Amer-i-can.” According to Duncan, Coretta Scott King first introduced Jesse Jackson to the poem in 1989 when she showed him the calendar. In 1990, at a speech in New Orleans, Jackson read the poem and began using the term “African American” (Duncan 2010). Like the term “black,” “African American” has a complex and highly politicized history: some people of African descent still prefer “black” because they do not associate themselves with Africa, while others embrace “African American” precisely because of its explicit acknowledgment of an African heritage. Still others deploy “black” as a way of marking global affiliations that exceed “America” (Gilroy 1993; Singh 2004).</p>
<p>In black intellectual circles at the turn of the twentieth century, the term “black” began to emerge as an antiracist response to ideologies of white supremacy disseminated through science. W. E. B Du Bois, for example, delivered a paper in 1887 at the founding conference of the American Negro Academy in which he critiqued the biological determinism prevalent in nineteenth-century scientific discourse. The form of racism that Du Bois attacked maintained that physical differences between the races account for social and psychological differences—that black (i.e., dark and not-yet- or not-quite-white) skin corresponds to a lower socially developed human form. Du Bois critiqued this racist science by calling attention to the role that history, law, and religion—humanistic rather than scientific theories—have played in the differences among the races. This critique was important because it called attention to the effects of history and sociocultural factors to explain racial differences as opposed to biophysical ones. His argument was the foundation for his most oft-quoted line from <em>The Souls of Black Folk</em>—“The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line”—and for his notion of “double consciousness” (1903/1997, 45).</p>
<p>Du Bois’s critique of racial essentialism is foundational to approaches in American studies and cultural studies that have become known as racial constructivism. These approaches focus on historical processes of racialization, suggesting that essentialist racial identity categories are stable only due to their repeated references in the context of specific racial projects (J. Butler 1990; Omi and Winant 1986/1994). Theorists today stress the need to read race as a result of dialogic processes between material bodies and sociocultural influences. An important forerunner of these theories and theorists, Du Bois’s critique was aimed at racist scientific discourses promulgated not just by whites but also by leaders in the black community, such as Marcus Garvey and his Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), which promoted the return to Africa as well as racial uplift and a radical black consciousness. Du Bois’s critique of race discourse and Garvey’s mobilization of that discourse to promote political consciousness around blackness prefigured debates in the 1960s during the emergence of the civil rights movement, as black leaders and artists began to struggle to expand notions of blackness (Du Bois), while also solidifying a common definition around which divergent factions could organize as a community against racism (Garvey) (Blight and Gooding-Williams 1997; Dawson 2001; Ongiri 2010).</p>
<p>These forms of political and cultural activism drew on a rich and often ignored history of cultural production during the Harlem Renaissance. In the 1920s, a consolidation of black pride formed in the African diaspora, especially in the French Caribbean and in Paris through what became known as the Négritude movement. The Martinique poet Aimé Césaire coined the term “negritude” as a way to recuperate the French <em>négre</em>, often translated as “nigger,” to signify something closer to the more prideful “black” that was circulating in North America (Nesbitt 1999). Négritude was further developed and revised by a number of thinkers and writers, ranging from poet, philosopher, and Senegalese president Léopold Sedar Senghor to the influential Martinique psychoanalyst Frantz Fanon (Senghor 1964; Fanon 1963/2004, 1967a).</p>
<p>Emerging within this global frame and in the context of the civil rights movement, the word “black” became highly politicized. It replaced terms such as “colored” and “Negro” that had become associated with Jim Crow laws and outdated views of people of African descent as benignly subordinate to whites. It also indexed a conscious effort to reappropriate the negative connotations of the term in order to instill race pride among blacks. The term became a part of the name of almost every political organization or movement, including the Black Panther Party and the Black Arts Movement. The heightening of what became known as “black consciousness” and “black nationalism” in the 1960s was critical for the deployment of the term “black” as a cultural mode of being, an analytic, and a site of organized resistance to the global history of white supremacy. Political figures such as Malcolm X and Bobby Seale and organizations such as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Black Panther Party encouraged blacks to disavow white values, beliefs, and ways of knowing and to replace them with black or African worldviews. Signifying oppositionally on the notion that black was somehow inferior to white, Americans of African descent deployed the term “black” to demonstrate their rich cultural heritage through diverse aspects of both expressive and consumer culture—clothing (dashikis), music (rhythm-and-blues and soul music), hair (the afro and braids), language (“black English”), theater (Black Arts Repertory Theater), foodways (soul food), and literature (the Black Arts Movement). Vernacular expressions that reinforced this race pride also circulated during this time: “Black is beautiful. Brown is it. Yellow is something. White ain’t shit.” James Brown’s 1968 hit “Say It Loud (I’m Black and I’m Proud)” became a signature anthem.</p>
<p>As during the Harlem Renaissance, art and politics were intimately intertwined during this period as the Black Arts Movement emerged as the cultural front of the Black Power Movement. The poetic and theatrical expressions of Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones), Haki Madhubuti (Don L. Lee), Sonia Sanchez, Nikki Giovanni, and others reflected the imbrication of aesthetics and politics. These artists and performers spoke of their art both as weapons against oppression and as the vanguard of black creative expression. Kimberly Benston argues that for these black artists of the 1960s, “writing, properly reconceived and directed as utterance and as act, was advanced as a signal instrument of cultural liberation” (2000, 2). Cultural liberation meant an adherence to what was coined “the black aesthetic,” a set of principles and standards by which all expressive arts by people of African descent should conform and to which they should aspire. Addison Gayle codified the aesthetic dimensions of this struggle in <em>The Black Aesthetic</em> (1971), a collection of essays that elaborated the goals and characteristics of Black Arts. Stephen Henderson’s <em>Understanding the New Black Poetry</em> (1973) was similar to Gayle’s book but with a focus on the tenets of black poetry and its distinguishing features. The artists and intellectuals who were a part of the movement held a range of political views and beliefs about how best to empower the community, but the one through line was a common belief in an authentic or essential blackness.</p>
<p>The effects of this strategic deployment of black essentialism were twofold. On the one hand, the movement enabled a proliferation of artistic expression. The publishing houses, theaters, and intellectual activity it produced made possible the emergence of area and ethnic studies departments devoted to the study of race in academic institutions. Black student riots and takeovers at institutions of higher education across the country demanded that administrators take seriously the intellectual and artistic contributions of people of African descent, which undoubtedly grew out of the fomenting Black Power and Black Arts Movements (Baker, Diawara, and Lindeborg 1996). On the other hand, the movement’s reliance on essentialist understandings of blackness created a complex matrix of politics about who could be included under “black” as an umbrella term. While the male leadership of the Black Power Movement believed that black women were a part of the category “black,” their views about the role that women should play in the movement mitigated their inclusion. Other identity markers such as sexuality and class status also determined the degree of one’s blackness, with homosexuality being viewed as a white disease that had infected the black community and middle-class status viewed as a site of total political capitulation to the white status quo (Cleaver 1968; V. Smith 1998; E. Johnson 2003). This tendency toward selective exclusion and inclusion entered into and structured academic debate as scholars and activists focused on the question of what and who constitutes blackness (Asante 1987; Baker 1987a; Gates 1987; Joyce 1987a, 1987b; Johnson and Henderson 2005). One result of this struggle is that most departments and programs battled over nomenclature, with suggestions for naming ranging from “Black Studies” and “Afro-American Studies” in the 1960s and early 1970s to “African American Studies,” “Africana Studies,” and “African and African Diasporic Studies” from the late 1970s to the present.</p>
<p>These struggles over naming and the meaning of blackness coincided with the emergence of structuralism and poststructuralism in the academy. These approaches to the study of culture threw into question notions of authenticity and stable meanings of texts. Some black theorists, especially literary critics, drew heavily on poststructuralism to expand what might count as a “black” text and who might count as a “black” author. These critics often focused on black women writers (M. Henderson 1989), gays and lesbians (B. Smith 1982), or a general engagement with the ways black texts signify beyond a specific referent (Gates 1978; Baker 1986). They gained a platform in a white academy friendly to both poststructuralism and racial antiessentialism but not without pushback from traditional black scholars who saw the adoption of mostly Western theories to analyze black literature as leading to the devaluation of its political and cultural intent (Christian 1987; Joyce 1987a).</p>
<p>Outside the United States, usages of the term “black” followed a similar pattern as they entered into and catalyzed debates about identity and identity politics. In several contexts, the term does not necessarily have as a referent Africa or people of African descent. Aboriginals in Australia are referred to as “black” (Broome 2010), and the subcaste of people in India known as “dalit” or the “untouchables” are referenced as “black,” as were many Indians during British colonialism (L. James 2000; Rajshekar 2009). With the advent of mass immigration from the British colonies to the metropole during the 1970s and ’80s, the term “black” began to be used to reference any former colonial subject: West Indian, African, South Asian. One result was the intellectual formation known in Britain as black cultural studies (Gilroy 1991, 1993; Mercer 1994; S. Hall 1973, 1992b). These writings were influential on black critical thought in the United States and encouraged scholars to conceive of blackness as a much more capacious signifier, provoking them to rethink racialized knowledge production, identity formation and history, and the circulation of blackness within a global context (Gilroy 1991; Favor 1999; Walcott 2000; E. Johnson 2003; Michelle Wright 2004; Elam and Jackson, 2005; Hine, Keaton, and Small 2009). In each of these contexts, the designation of blackness had as much to do with politics as phenotype. Even in the United States, groups we now think of as “white” were earlier described as “black.” The Irish, for example, were considered the “blacks of Europe” due to their status as British colonials. They became white only once they had emigrated to the United States and ascended the socioeconomic scale (Ignatiev 1995).</p>
<p>Over the past decade, an interest in postidentity studies has fueled a new revision of blackness and its meanings. Mixed-raced scholars writing about their own life experiences (Senna 1999, 2010; R. Walker 2002) and mixed-raced artists who claim multiple identities (e.g., Mariah Carey, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry) have engaged the rhetoric of the U.S. “postracial” moment since the election of Barack Obama (Elam 2011). While this interest in postraciality might, on the surface, suggest that the importance of “black” as a racial signifier is waning, we need only look to the most prominent of the self-identified mixed-raced figures such as Tiger Woods and Barack Obama to understand how the historical weight of blackness haunts the present. If the history of the term “black” has taught us anything, it is that racialized symbols—those that are disparaging and those that are affirming—never quite fade from sight or consciousness but constantly evolve alongside the people who create them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the capitalist system is generally celebrated by mainstream economists, American studies and cultural studies scholars will search in vain through their writings for actual discussions of the term “capitalism.” Instead, neoclassical and Keynesian economists refer to the “market economy” (in which individuals and private firms make decisions in decentralized markets) or just “the economy” (defined by scarce means and unlimited desires, the correct balancing of which is said to characterize all societies) (Stiglitz and Walsh 2002; Bhagwati 2003; Krugman and Wells 2004; Samuelson and Nordhaus 2004).</p>
<p>In contrast, discussions of the term “capitalism” have long occupied a central position in the vocabulary of Marxian economic theory. References to capitalism in American studies and cultural studies draw, implicitly or explicitly, on the Marxian critique of political economy: a critique of capitalism as an economic and social system and a critique of mainstream economic theory. Karl Marx and latter-day Marxists criticize capitalism because it is based on exploitation, in the sense that capitalists appropriate and decide how to distribute the surplus labor performed by the direct producers, and because it periodically enters into crisis, imposing tremendous costs on the majority of people. They also criticize the work of mainstream economists for celebrating the existence of capitalism and for treating capitalist institutions and behaviors as corresponding to human nature (Mandel 1976; Resnick and Wolff 1987; Harvey 1989).</p>
<p>Much of this scholarship draws on Marx and Friedrich Engels’s critique of political economy in the <em>Manifesto of the Communist Party </em>(1848) and the three volumes of <em>Capital </em>(1867, 1884, 1894). In the <em>Manifesto</em>, Marx and Engels compare capitalism to other forms of economic and social organization such as feudalism and slavery. What they have in common is that all are based on class exploitation, defined as one group (feudal lords, slave owners, and capitalists) appropriating the surplus labor of another (serfs, slaves, and wage laborers). At the same time, capitalism exhibits a distinct dynamic. For the first time in history, it “established the world market,” making it possible for the capitalist class to “nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions everywhere” and giving “a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country” (1848/1976, 486, 487). It leads to radical and continuous changes throughout the economy and society, since, as Marx and Engels famously put it, “all that is solid melts into air” (1848/1976, 487).</p>
<p>If the goal of the <em>Manifesto </em>was to challenge the prevailing belief that capitalism had eliminated classes and class struggles, the point of <em>Capital </em>was to analyze the specific conditions and consequences of the class dimensions of a society in which the capitalist mode of production prevails. Capitalism presumes that the products of labor have become commodities, in the sense that the goods and services that human beings produce have both a use value (they satisfy some social need) and an exchange value (they can be exchanged for other commodities or money). The existence of commodity exchange, in turn, presupposes a culture congruent with the “fetishism of commodities”: a culture whereby individuals come to believe and act such that they have the freedom to buy and sell commodities, that the commodities they exchange are equal in value, that the commodity owners meet one another as equals in the marketplace, that individuals have well-defined property rights in the commodities they sell and purchase, and that they are able to calculate the ability of external objects to satisfy their needs and desires. The existence of commodity exchange is not based on the essential and universal human rationality assumed within mainstream economics from Adam Smith to the present. Nor can the cultures and identities of commodity-exchanging individuals be derived solely from economic activities and institutions. Rather, commodity exchange both presumes and constitutes particular subjectivities—forms of rationality and calculation—on the part of economic agents (Amariglio and Callari 1993).</p>
<p>In both the <em>Manifesto </em>and <em>Capital</em>, capitalism refers to a system in which capitalists are able to produce commodities that will, at least in principle, yield them a profit. The source of the profit is the value created by the laborers who have been forced (historically, through a process Marx referred to as “primitive accumulation,” and, socially, through capitalist institutions and cultures [1867/1976, 1:871–940]) to exercise the specifically capitalist “freedom” to sell their ability to labor as a commodity. Under the assumption that all commodities (including labor power) are exchanged at their values, a surplus value arises based on the ability of capitalists to appropriate the surplus labor performed by the wage laborers and to realize that extra labor by selling the commodities that are produced. Struggles consequently arise over the “rate of exploitation” (the ratio of surplus value to the value of labor power) and over the subsequent distributions of surplus value (to managers, state officials, and other capitalists, who receive portions of the surplus). The keyword “capitalism” thus designates not just an economic structure but also the conﬂicts, contradictions, and subjectivities inherent in that structure. Both the initial emergence and the subsequent reproduction of capitalism, if and when they occur, often lead to social dislocations and acute crises; they are also conditioned by the most varied cultures and social identities.</p>
<p>In the case of the United States, the past two centuries have witnessed the widening and deepening of capitalism, both domestically and internationally. Initially a market for foreign (especially British) capitalist commodities, the original thirteen colonies oversaw the establishment and growth of domestic capitalist enterprises, which sought both raw materials and markets for final goods within expanding geographical boundaries and across a heterogeneous class landscape. One result was that noncapitalist (communal, independent, slave, and feudal) producers were eventually undermined or displaced, thereby causing waves of rural peoples (men, women, and children of diverse racial and ethnic origins) to migrate to existing and newly established cities and to sell their labor power to industrial capitalists. The opening up of new domestic markets (through the determined efforts of retail merchants, advertisers, and banks), capitalist competition (which drove down the unit costs of production), and government programs (to establish a national currency and to regulate trusts and working conditions) spurred further capitalist growth. The continued development of capitalist manufacturing provoked vast international migrations of laborers: initially, from Africa and western Europe; later, and continuing to this day, from Latin America, Asia, eastern Europe, and Africa (Dowd 1977; Duboff 1989; Amott and Matthaei 1996).</p>
<p>The movement of capital that accompanied the expansion of markets and the search for cheaper raw materials transformed regions outside the industrialized Northeast, including the relocation of textile mills to the South, the creation of foundries and automobile factories in the Midwest, the development of the oil industry in the Southwest, and the ﬂourishing of capitalist agriculture and the movie industry on the West Coast. Capital was also exported to other countries to take advantage of lower wage levels and other cost advantages, thereby introducing economic and social dislocations similar to those that had occurred inside the United States. In both cases, governments, business groups, and social movements (such as trade unions, civil rights organizations, and political parties) struggled over the economic and social conditions and consequences of the new industrial capitalist investments—the boom and bust cycles of domestic economic growth, large-scale movements of populations, the formation of new social identities, and imperial interventions. The uneven development of capitalism at home and abroad has left its mark on the culture of the United States (Kaplan and Pease 1993; Jacobson 2000).</p>
<p>In the first decade of the twenty-first century, as during the Great Depression of the 1930s and many other times throughout U.S. history, capitalism entered into an economic and cultural crisis. The conditions leading up to the current crisis have put new issues on the agenda of American studies and cultural studies—the exponential growth of inequality (Collins, di Leonardo, and Williams 2008), the role of economists in creating the crisis (Grossberg 2010b), the increasing importance of the financial sector (R. Martin 2010), the continued racialization of the housing market through subprime lending practices (Lipsitz 2011), and the heightened role of communication technologies and culture in processes of capital accumulation (Fuchs et al. 2010). The severity of the crisis has cast doubt on the legitimacy of neoliberalism and of capitalism itself (J. Clarke 2010).</p>
<p>In the analysis of this nexus of capitalism and U.S. culture, we face three major challenges that in turn open up new paths of investigation for American studies and cultural studies. The first concerns globalization. It is often assumed that the internationalization of the U.S. economy and society is a radically new phenomenon, something that burst on the scene in the 1980s. However, when measured in terms of movements of people (migration), goods and services (imports and exports), and money (capital inﬂows and outﬂows), the globalization of capitalism achieved in that decade levels that are quite similar to those experienced almost a century earlier (Ruccio 2003). Because of these similarities and others (particularly the rise in the rate of exploitation and, with it, the increasingly unequal distribution of income and wealth), it is a mistake to describe contemporary developments as unprecedented (Phillips 2002). This is not to say that the forms of capitalist development during the two periods are the same. One of the challenges for students of U.S. culture is to register these differences—such as the outsourcing of jobs, the growth of Wal-Mart, the spread of financial markets, the conduct of wars to protect petroleum supplies, and the emergence of new media and communication technologies—without losing sight of the past.</p>
<p>The second challenge is to avoid treating capitalism as a purely economic system, separate from culture. The inﬂuence of capitalism on the culture industry, including the rise of a capitalist film industry and the export of U.S. culture (Miller et al. 2001; Wayne 2003), has been widely studied and debated. What is less clear is that the capitalist economy is saturated by cultural meanings and identities. From this perspective, each moment of capitalism, from the existence of commodity exchange to the export of capital, is simultaneously economic and cultural. The point is not to substitute cultural studies for political economy but to recognize and analyze, concretely and historically, the cultural conditions of capitalism. Money, commodities, labor power, surplus value, profits: all of these economic forms require the performance of historically and socially constructed meanings and identities. It is also important to understand the role of economic thought in inﬂuencing the development of U.S. capitalism and U.S. culture generally. These topics remain open, though a fruitful place to begin is by understanding the role that “languages of class” play in creating new class identities (Gibson-Graham, Resnick, and Wolff 2001), the complex interplay of capitalist and noncapitalist economic imaginaries (Watkins 1998), and the need to rethink the economy and economic knowledge (Grossberg 2010a).</p>
<p>The third potential stumbling block is the treatment of capitalism as an all-encompassing, unitary system that has colonized every social arena and region of the globe. While capitalism certainly represents a powerful project for making and remaking the world, deploying the concept of capitalism as a complete mapping of the economic and social landscape has the effect of obscuring noncapitalist forms of economic organization and cultural sense making. “Capitalocentrism” (akin to the role played by “phallocentrism” and “logocentrism” with respect to gender and language, respectively) hides from view the diverse ways in which people in the United States and elsewhere participate in individual and collective noncapitalist economies—including barter, communal production, gift giving, and solidarity—that fall outside the practices and presumed logic of capitalism (Gibson-Graham 1996; Ruccio and Gibson-Graham 2001). On this view, U.S. culture is heterogeneous and contradictory with respect to different class structures. It contains elements that foster and reproduce capitalism and, at the same time, its noncapitalist others.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although we tend to think of citizenship as something national, originally the citizen was simply a certain kind of someone who lived in a Greek city: a member of an elite class who was said to be capable of self-governance and therefore of the legal and military governance of the city. But the ancient history of the term tells us little about the constellation of rights, laws, obligations, interests, fantasies, and expectations that shape the modern scene of citizenship, which is generally said to have been initiated by the democratic revolutions of the eighteenth century (B. Anderson 1991; B. Turner 1993; Mouffe 1995). Most simply, citizenship refers to a standing within the law (this is often called <em>formal </em>citizenship); <em>jus soli </em>citizenship allots citizenship to people born within the geographical territory, and <em>jus sanguinis </em>awards citizenship by way of a parental inheritance.</p>
<p>At the same time, citizenship is a relation among strangers who learn to feel it as a common identity based on shared historical, legal, or familial connection to a geopolitical space. Many institutional and social practices are aimed at inducing a visceral linkage of personal identity with nationality. In the United States, this process has often involved the orchestration of fantasies about the promise of the state and the nation to cultivate and protect a consensually recognized ideal of the “good life”; in return for cultural, legal, and military security, people are asked to love their country and to recognize certain stories, events, experiences, practices, and ways of life as related to the core of who they are, their public status, and their resemblance to other people. This training in politicized intimacy has served as a way of turning political boundaries into visceral, emotional, and seemingly hardwired responses of “insiders” to “outsiders.” Thus, we can say that citizenship’s legal architecture manifests itself and is continually reshaped in the space of transactions between intimates and strangers. The term “civil society” is often applied to these scenes of <em>substantive </em>citizenship, though discussions of civil society tend to focus only on the rational aspects of communication and interaction that contribute to the state’s reproduction of mainstream society, and not to the ordinary affective or interactive aspects of social exchange (Habermas 1999).</p>
<p>The concept of sovereignty is a crucial bridge between the legal and the substantive domains of U.S. citizenship. This term presupposes a relation between the nation’s legal control over what happens in its territory and the presumption that citizens should have control over their lives and bodies, a condition of limited personal autonomy that the state has a responsibility to protect. But the promise of U.S. citizenship to deliver sovereignty to all of its citizens has always been practiced unevenly, in contradiction with most understandings of democratic ideals (Rancière 1998). The historical conditions of legal and social belonging have been manipulated to serve the concentration of economic, racial, and sexual power in the society’s ruling blocs.</p>
<p>This shaping of the political experience of citizens and noncitizens has been a focus of much recent scholarship and political struggle. These discussions contest the term “citizenship” in various ways: “cultural citizenship” describes the histories of subordinated groups within the nation-state that might not be covered by official legal or political narratives (T. Miller 1993, 2001; Ong 1996; R. Rosaldo 1999); “consumer citizenship” designates contemporary practices of social belonging and political pacification in the United States (Shanley 1997; Cronin 2000; L. Cohen 2003); “sexual citizenship” references the ongoing struggle to gain full legal rights for gendered and sexual minorities (Berlant and Warner 2000; Cott 2000; M. Kaplan 1997); and “global citizenship” describes a project of deriving a concept of justice from linkages among people on a transnational or global scale (Falk 1994; Bosniak 1998; Hardt and Negri 2000). This list could be vastly expanded. Patriotic citizenship, economic citizenship, and legal citizenship have all been shaped not just within a political public sphere, not just within the logic of mass culture and consumer capitalism, but also within a discussion among various collective interest groups struggling over the core norms, practices, and mentalities of a putatively general U.S. population.</p>
<p>The histories of racial and sexual standing in the United States provide the clearest examples of the uneven access to the full benefits of citizenship. But historically citizenship has also shaped less recognized kinds of distinction. Central among these is that U.S. citizenship has always involved tensions between federal and state systems. Indeed, for most of U.S. history, state citizenship had priority, and the history of civil and suffrage rights centrally involved arguments over the relative priority of state versus federal law. For example, the 1967 Supreme Court case <em>Loving v. Virginia</em> (388 U.S. 1), which deemed it unconstitutional to forbid marriage among heterosexuals identified as being of different races, nullified “antimiscegenation” laws not only in Virginia but in thirty-seven other states as well. In so doing, the Supreme Court argued that it is a general rule of U.S. citizenship that marriage cannot be governed by racial restrictions. Prior to that, states were more important than the nation in determining the racial component of legal marriage among heterosexuals, as well as in many other sexual, familial, and commercial matters, including the legal standing of Mormon, lesbian, gay, and women’s marital practices, age of consent, marital rape, reproduction (e.g., abortion, surrogacy, and adoption), and child protection.</p>
<p>Given these complex legal and social histories, U.S. citizenship may be best thought of as an intricate scene where competing forces, definitions, and geographies of freedom and liberty are lived concretely. Citizenship is the practical site of a theoretical existence, in that it allows for the reproduction of a variety of kinds of law in everyday life. It is an abstract idea on behalf of which people engage in personal and political acts, from cheating on taxes to pledging allegiance to fomenting revolutions. It is also, importantly, an ordinary space of activity that many people occupy without thinking much about it, as the administration of citizenship is usually delegated to the political sphere and only periodically worried over during exceptional crises or the election season.</p>
<p>Recent scholarship has pursued this insight into the everyday life of citizenship by exploring some of the most contested scenes in which citizenship has been battled over in U.S. history: immigration, voting rights, sexuality, and labor. Immigration and suffrage have been closely linked at least since the U.S. Naturalization Act of 1790 allowed only “free white persons” to be naturalized as full U.S. citizens. Implicitly this act began the shift from a definition of citizenship as the <em>ownership of property </em>to citizenship as the <em>ownership of labor</em>, since the word “free” in this act defined freedom as not being economically enslaved—that is, free to sell one’s labor in a market for wages (Glenn 2004). The history of U.S. immigrant rights (and exclusions) is thus tied up with desires to control the conditions under which certain populations would be “free” to perform labor in the United States without access to many of the privileges of “free white persons,” such as the vote and the legal standing to enforce contracts (Haney-López 1996; Lipsitz 2006; Roediger 1999).</p>
<p>So, for example, between 1882 and 1952, virtually all Asian immigrants except for a small number of Filipino laborers were excluded from full U.S. citizenship. During this period, the United States was also opening and closing the gates to Latin American peoples, especially Mexicans, hundreds of thousands of whom were forcibly repatriated to Mexico a number of times, following ﬂuctuations in capitalists’ needs and white racial anxieties about disease and moral degeneracy, along with the usual and always false fear that “alien” poor people take more from the economy than they contribute to it. The courts adjudicating these shifts veered between using racial science and “common knowledge,” especially in the visual register, as justification for discrimination (Honig 1998; Jacobson 1998, 2000; Roberts 1998). Similarly, arguments for <em>and </em>against suffrage for women appealed to common sense, racist science, and biblical authority to protect patriarchal privilege. Suffrage was achieved only when President Woodrow Wilson found it politically expedient to use an image of emancipated femininity to establish U.S. modernity and moral superiority on a global scale (Berlant 2002). Federal and state manipulation of voting rights continues to threaten the representation of many citizens, especially the poor and the incarcerated.</p>
<p>The same pseudoscientific rationales that maintained white supremacy in the performance of U.S. citizenship were also crucial in shaping reproductive law. It may not seem a question of citizenship when a court determines, as it did in the early twentieth century, that it is proper to sterilize women deemed mentally ill, intellectually limited, or epileptic. But the presumption was that these women would be incompetent as mothers and would pass their incompetence on to their children and that the nation would be burdened by the social and economic costs of reproduction by the poor. Poor women and women of color, especially African American and Native American women, were isolated by this juridical-medical ideology: in California, until the late nineteenth century, Native American children could be taken from their families without due process; until 1972, the state of Virginia routinely sterilized poor women without their consent if their offspring were deemed vulnerable to taking on a “degenerate” form (Ginsburg 1998; Stern 1999b). These examples demonstrate that certain perquisites of citizenship, such as the material experience of sovereignty and sexual “privacy” (a modern development within sovereignty), have often been unavailable to the poor, thereby privileging the wealthier classes and the sexually “normal.”</p>
<p>What connects these cases to the keyword “citizenship” is not that they are denials of state-protected <em>rights </em>(there has never been a “right” to medical care in the United States). Rather, the contradiction between the sovereignty of abstract citizens and the everyday lives of embodied subjects has been structured by the administration of class hierarchies alongside formal democracy. So it is no surprise that citizenship norms and laws have been highly contested in the workplace as well. Should places of business be allowed to function by different standards than the public domain? Should the protections of citizenship punch out when the worker punches in? Should there be different rules for free speech and political speech on private property and public property? These and other legal questions of citizen sovereignty are put to the test in labor relations. It was not until the last decades of the nineteenth century that workers won the right to an eight-hour day; and during the post–World War II era, many employers made “concessions” to their workers, such as the family wage, health insurance, pensions, and protecting workers from undue physical harm on the job. None of these concessions would have happened without the organizing energy of the labor movement, as we can see when, in tight economic times, corporations renege on contracts with workers, and states cut back on oversight of corporations’ economic, environmental, and worker-health practices. Most histories of U.S. citizenship would not place worker rights at the center of a consideration of the practice of equality in the law and social spaces. But insofar as citizens and workers live citizenship as an experience of sovereignty in their everyday lives, the conditions of labor and the formal and informal rules about organizing worker demands for employer accountability have to be at the center of the story.</p>
<p>Many other vectors of normative and legal adjudication that have structured citizenship could be isolated and enumerated, such as human rights, family law, public education, military conscription, real estate zoning, tax structure, religion, and various state entitlement programs. Such seemingly separate domains are actually mutually defining. What, for example, has Christianity had to do with U.S. citizenship, given the constitutionally mandated prohibition of an official state religion? While some theorists have correlated the development of modern public spheres with the secularization of the shared social world, this evolutionary liberal model has recently been shattered by a cluster of different arguments: that the founding fathers were installing political modernity within the strictures of a Protestant morality of conscience; that the history of legislation around marriage, the family, and children has inevitably been inﬂuenced by religious movements advocating for and against traditional patriarchal control; that religious organizations have shaped powerfully the historical relation of the public and the private in terms of rights and proprieties; that the development of the welfare state and the civil rights understanding of the economic basis of rights was crucially shaped by religious thinkers (Harding 2001; Morone 2003; Bruce and Voas 2004). At the same time, local communities often engender notions of proper citizenship through churches, schools, and other institutions that involve face-to-face social participation (Ong 1996). The religious question has also been central to the story of the citizenship of Mormons, Native Americans, and many immigrant groups, involving taxation, reproductive rights, free speech, public education, and diverse discussions of the material relation of morality to political and economic concerns.</p>
<p>Many of the progressive developments in U.S. citizenship would not have been achieved without the internationally based struggles of socialism, feminism, and the labor movement. Today, the United States feels pressure from other international movements dedicated to transforming its practices of citizenship: religious movements (Christian fundamentalism and evangelicalism, Islam, Catholicism); antineoliberalism (antiglobalization movements dedicated to a sustaining rather than exploitative and depleting version of global integration); international legal and policy institutions (the United Nations and the International Court of Justice; Doctors without Borders). While international institutions tend to be oriented toward a one-world model of justice, resource distribution, and peace, there is no singular direction or vision of the good life projected by these movements. Antineoliberalism is a <em>motive </em>rather than a program, coordinating liberal reformist models of ameliorative activity (environmentalism, welfare statism) with more radical anarchist, queer, antiracist models of refusal and demand. Global religious movements link anticapitalist (antipoverty) messages with a variety of assertions of local sovereignty against the abstract imperialism and general liberality of the modernist state.</p>
<p>Innovations in communication and transportation technology, most notably the Internet, have revitalized and even enabled new inter- and transnational movements and have often produced new understandings of citizenship (Dahlberg 2001; Graeber 2002; Poster 1999). Local determination is not a major stress point among Internet utopians: personal attachments across the globe are made possible by the speed of information transmission. The seemingly infinitely expanding possibilities of niche political developments and micromovements have reanimated citizenship as an aspirational concept in discussions of diverse communities, real and imagined. Thus, the nation-state as such has become only one player in struggles over political and social justice, so much so that many states feel threatened by the transnational ﬂow of information and have responded with censorship. Still, the delocalization of citizenship has not made the world simply postnational. Corporations are like empires; both work transnationally to reshape national standards of conduct. So too the activity of ordinary people to force accountability and to imagine new possibilities for democratic collective life and the sovereignty of people—whether or not they are citizens—continues to revitalize the political sphere everywhere.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Raymond Williams (1973) demonstrated the overarching significance of the keywords “city” and “country,” establishing the simultaneously positive and negative inflections of urbanity and rurality. For urbanity, on the positive side were the values of learning, light, progress, civilization, cosmopolitanism, tolerance and civil liberties, excitement, and sophistication; on the negative lay the countervalues of sin, darkness and noise, corruption and devolution, danger and violence, irreligion, mob rule, and anomie—in short, urban modernity and its discontents.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As Williams noted, these city/country oppositions are always invoked in the service of political interests. Diverse social actors described European and, later, US urban life in ways that shifted and evolved with cities themselves. Troubadours, priests, ministers, and Romantic poets gave way to flaneurs and other urban observers, who then gave way to social statisticians, settlement-house workers, novelists, playwrights, journalists, photographers, and painters. The new social scientists and artists took cities and urban dwellers as their research objects, as problems to be solved, and as material to be dramatized. In this thrifty recycling of tropes, a set of symbolic associations arose linking the European and American urban poor to colonized others through their mutual need for instruction from their betters (di Leonardo 1998). The voluminous writings of missionaries, journalists, and reformers in Victorian Britain provided a template for later US constructions of “urban jungles” filled with the “near-savage” poor. Socialist novelist Jack London (1903, 288), in an account of life among East London’s homeless at the time of Edward’s coronation, declared passionately that it was “far better to be a people of the wilderness and desert, of the cave and the squatting-place, than to be a people of the machine and the Abyss.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The long history of North American and US urban imaginaries include the Puritan vision of the blessed gathering of the elect as a “city on a hill”; the revolutionary republican associations attached to Boston and Philadelphia; the new nation’s classically planned capital of Washington, DC; and diverse nineteenth-century texts that American studies pioneer Leo Marx ([1964] 2000) cataloged under the heading of the “machine in the garden,” a trope he used to link industrialization, urbanization, and pastoralism. The nineteenth century brought the westward expansion of the new republic and the rapid growth of New York and Boston, the legal end of slavery and the first “great migration” of freed men and women to northern cities, the rapid rise of capitalist industrialization and its associated second major wave of labor migration from Europe and Asia, the first wave of the women’s movement and of homegrown radicalisms hatched in urban environments, and US imperial actions in the Caribbean, Latin America, and the Pacific, all of which created bridges for future migration to US cities. These historical developments, along with many others, were connected to vast urban growth fueled by external and internal migration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dominant urban imaginaries reflected and interpreted these sea changes. The “Chicago school” social scientists, from the 1910s forward, tended to envision inevitable progress as repeated waves of migrants of every nationality first settled in center cities and then moved to outer and suburban rings as they experienced upward social mobility. This narrative credited poor and nonwhite urban dwellers with civility and the capacity for self-organization. Other scholars, journalists, and artists focused instead on the dirt, pollution, noise, and overcrowding of rapidly expanding US cities, though from contrasting political perspectives. Progressives such as Upton Sinclair ([1906] 1988) described the capitalist exploitation of downtrodden urban dwellers and the corrupt urban machines (such as New York’s infamous Tammany Hall) that failed to ameliorate their lot. Their opponents, such as Madison Grant (1916), envisioned cities as cesspools harboring the genetically unfit and overly procreative, particularly Italians, Irish, Jews, and Slavs and other southeastern European immigrants. The associations of these new immigrants with poverty, crime, disease, and hyperfertility have been recycled across the decades to apply to populations now construed as “racial,” particularly blacks, Latinos, and in the Trump era, Muslims. Related associations of urban worlds and their racialized populations with sexual danger and “perversion” have obscured the role that cities have played in women’s emancipation and interracial and queer community building since at least the nineteenth century (Chauncey 1994; Mumford 1997; Delany 2001).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the same time, mainstream social scientists continue to frame sexual and racial forms of capitalist exploitation as expressions of cultural difference and pathology. Counterempirical descriptions of a “culture of poverty” in the 1960s shifted in the 1980s into a contrast between the “urban underclass” and new “model minorities” (largely new Asian and select Latino migrants), even as urban renewal projects destroyed low-cost housing. “Asphalt jungles” gave way to “welfare queens” and journalistic hysteria over inner-city crime, drugs, and gangs. Replicating the oppositional structure of earlier figurations, the late twentieth century saw the rise of rap, hip-hop, and break dancing and the marketing of the virtues of urban “diversity,” even as gentrification was raising real estate values in minority neighborhood after neighborhood, thus pricing out those “diverse” populations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The global neoliberal shift of the 1980s forward—the wholesale privatization of public goods and cutbacks in all social programs combined with an identity-based reading of human rights—and US imperial responses to global terrorism have further complicated urban representations and realities. Among the factors reconfiguring US urban life are the representation of cities as targets of terrorist attacks and the related stigmatization of Muslims/Arabs/Sikhs; the uncertainty occasioned by ongoing global economic volatility, sovereign debt crises, and continuous capitalist “creative destruction” (Harvey 2005); and the explosion of “urban contemporary” (black and Latino) music, dance, and fashion. The associated rise of social-media-based urban organizing has shaped responses to these developments, including demonstrations for “the right to the city” (Mitchell 2003) and against racist, xenophobic, and misogynist discrimination and violence such as those organized by Black Lives Matter and Ultraviolet. The hypergentrification of urban and suburban housing markets, the development of urban cores as tourist destinations, and the production of a touristified vision of urban functioning all contribute to what Matthew Ruben labels the “suburban optic” a way of seeing the city through suburbanized eyes (di Leonardo 2008; Ruben 2002; Zukin 2010). Simultaneously, the development of a network of “global cities”—New York, London, and Tokyo, among others—centralized the administration of finance capital (Sassen 1991).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The arrival of the Trump administration did not exactly initiate a new set of urban representations—all of its elements predated 2016—but under Trump, these tendencies have grown exponentially. For progressives, cities are now seen as sheltering and nurturing people of color; immigrants (“sanctuary cities”); lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) populations; feminist women and men; and resistance to racist, masculinist, and heterosexist visions of US democracy. For reactionaries, US cities now represent these “evil,” “immoral,” and specifically “un-American” populations—people who should be excised from the body politic to “make America great again.” As the twenty-first century proceeds, cities continue to serve as metonyms of both nations and their discontents.</span></p>

<p>Some form of class consciousness has existed in North America at least since white settlers arrived; John Winthrop’s (1630/1838) well-known sermon aboard the <em>Arbella</em>, “A Modell of Christian Charity,” in part justifies the existence of class differences by making them crucial to God’s plan of binding through charity the socially stratified community of Puritan believers. The descendants of those believers became an ever-rising post-Puritan middle class, as German sociologist Max Weber (1905/1958) famously suggested when he linked the “Protestant ethic” with capitalist economic energies. Simultaneously, the development of a specifically working-class or “plebeian” consciousness came out of the early U.S. situation of class stratification, and the scholarly dilemma ever since has been how to account for such stratification historically, socially, and culturally.</p>
<p>Closely related to such categories as “station,” “status,” “group,” “caste,” and “kind,” “class” resonates with implications of value, quality, respectability, and religious virtue. Goodness is gilded in much U.S. cultural thought, and it has been difficult to pry capital loose from rectitude. A related difficulty is that class can seem a natural and fixed category; certainly one strain of social and historical analysis in American studies has been marked by a static account of class and class belonging, with discrete strata exhibiting characteristic habits and allegiances and existing in hierarchical formation. In one of the best theoretical accounts, Erik Olin Wright (1985) makes useful distinctions among class <em>structure</em>, class <em>formation</em>, and class <em>consciousness</em>. Class structure is that ensemble of social relations into which individuals enter and which shapes their class consciousness; class formations are those organized collectivities that come about as a result of the interests shaped by the class structure or system. As Wright sums it up, classes “have a structural existence which is irreducible to the kinds of collective organizations which develop historically (class formations), the class ideologies held by individuals and organizations (class consciousness) or the forms of conﬂict engaged in by individuals as class members or by class organizations (class struggle), and . . . such class structures impose basic constraints on these other elements in the concept of class” (28).</p>
<p>These distinctions help keep in view the fact that class and classification are dynamic processes, more the result than the cause of historical events. Class, as British historian and cultural studies scholar E. P. Thompson (1963) insisted, is a <em>relational </em>category, always defined against and in tension with its dialectical others. In response to British cultural theorist Raymond Williams’s (1958, xvi) claim that culture should be defined as a “whole way of life,” Thompson (1961a, 33; 1961b) redefined culture as a “whole way of conflict,” structured in dominance and constantly contested by its various social actors. Work on class in American studies has done much to substantiate Thompson’s thesis, and the connections between Thompson’s historical reconstruction of British working-class formation, Williams’s inﬂuential model of cultural studies, and American studies scholarship focused on class have been often intimate.</p>
<p>This emphasis has battered time-honored and inﬂuential ideas about U.S. culture and society, such as Frederick Jackson Turner’s “frontier thesis” (1893/1920), in which westward-roving U.S. Americans continually reestablish the conditions for social mobility and rising wages, or Louis Hartz’s lament that a hegemonic “liberal tradition” rendered U.S. Americans incapable of thinking outside the contours of social consensus (1955). American studies scholars have shown, for example, how self-conscious, articulate, and combative early working-class or “artisan republican” ideologies were in waging rhetorical—and sometimes actual—war on what they termed the “nonproducing classes” or “the upper ten.” Sean Wilentz’s <em>Chants Democratic: New York City and the Rise of the American Working Class, 1788–1850 </em>(1984b) is one of the finest studies of the former, while Stuart Blumin’s <em>The Emergence of the Middle Class: Social Experience in the American City, 1760–1900 </em>(1989) is one of the best on the latter. Both capture how extensively the cultural and affective life of social class shaped democracy in the United States.</p>
<p>Each of these studies exemplifies a body of historiography that first emerged in the 1960s to explain the shape and nature of various class formations. Wilentz is the beneficiary of the “new social history,” of which Herbert Gutman (1976) was perhaps the chief U.S. representative. Subsequent studies of the labor process, shop-ﬂoor cultures, workers’ leisure activities, and other matters have decisively demonstrated the tenacious, conﬂictual character of working-class belonging—even, or most particularly, when that belonging is overdetermined by being African American or female (Peiss 1986; Kelley 1994). Meanwhile, extensive studies of bourgeois or middle-class cultural formations in major books by Warren Susman (1984), Jackson Lears (1981), and many others have shown how ruling-class desires and cultural investments have inﬂuenced everything from modern art to modern therapy, as well as the degree to which such canonical ideas as the “American character,” “American progress,” and the “American Dream” are inﬂected by class. Perhaps most illuminating have been studies by such scholars as Christine Stansell (1986), Richard Slotkin (1985), Hazel Carby (1987), Alan Trachtenberg (1982), and Lizabeth Cohen (2003) that examine the complex interrelations among various class fractions and formations.</p>
<p>One of the common findings of the latter sort of study is how often cross-class interaction works not to dissolve class boundaries but to buttress them. Examples include middle-class philanthropic enterprises that wind up solidifying bourgeois formations and alienating their would-be working-class wards, and African American strategies of racial uplift that too often demonize the black working class. For this reason and others, the category of class has been immensely useful in American studies as an analytical tool capable of unpacking the sometimes surprising dynamics of cultural and textual processes and products, from social clubs and theatrical performances to dime novels and Disney films. The class segregation of mid-nineteenth-century U.S. theaters, for example, has earned a whole tradition of scholarship, with its attention to class-bound characters, plots, settings, and themes; much the same has been done for the history of U.S. fiction, which has, scholars argue, differing trajectories based not only on plot, character, and outcome but also on mode of production and distribution. Cultural forms hardly recognized at all under erstwhile rubrics of U.S. cultural expression—balladry, mob action, table manners, amusement parks—have found a place in scholarly debates precisely as classed forms of cultural life. The saloon is now recognized no less than the literary salon as a space of cultural and social self-organization.</p>
<p>Just as importantly, quintessential public artifacts of U.S. culture such as New York City’s Central Park need to be understood as complex mediations of conﬂicting class, party, and historical factors. Witness too studies of U.S. newspapers, in which various class accents have been seen to vie for control of a given editorial tendency, newsworthy event, or style of audience address. The key, and often exhilarating, emphasis in such studies is that U.S. cultural forms do not so much belong to a given class or class fraction as they become sites in which class struggles are fought out. In recent years, studies of American “hemispheric” and global class struggles have moved to the fore, whether focused on the emergence of internationalist social movements (Reed 2005), the character and function of manufacturing sweatshops (Ross 1997), or the place of U.S. cultural formations in the world system (Denning 2004).</p>
<p>At their best, class-sensitive versions of American studies and cultural studies are animated by the attempt to grasp the complex dialectic of work and leisure—the structuring of U.S. society by the unequal and uneven social relations of labor and the ways in which those relations give rise to a vast array of cultural forms. The social location of the artist, the assembly-line production of films and cheap fiction: whatever the case, class analysis has immeasurably benefited our understanding of the cultural scene. The United States may be an exceptional place—what country is not?—but it has seen its fair share of class conﬂict in the sphere of culture, conﬂict that is intense, productive, and ongoing.</p>
