				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What should we call what happened in and around the Capitol building on Wednesday, January 6? A coup or an attempted coup? An insurrection? A white supremacist riot? Vigilante antidemocratic paramilitary violence? Did those who tried to overturn the election results commit acts of sedition? Treason?</p>
<p>There are solid arguments for any of these terms. The reason any or all of them can seem right is not a sign of intellectual sloppiness or lack of specificity, even as media commentators go to great lengths to come up with specific definitions of the terms they’re arguing for and against in order to make their cases. But no amount of defining can resolve the debate, because other thinkers and writers  can come along and define their terms in ways that make their argument plausible.  Language is social, not indexical.</p>
<p>That the definitions of these terms are contested across time and space means that they are what the scholar Raymond Williams called “keywords.” That means more than that they are rich and complex and important. It also means that the stakes of contestation over their meaning can advance our understanding of our culture and our society. The different ways we talk about the events of January 6 connect to the ways we think  the United States is or is not “united.”</p>
<p>In this dossier, you will find short responses to these events written by authors of some relevant keywords:  “conservative,” “fascism,” “intersectionality,” “populism,” and “whiteness.”  In soliciting these responses, we used these prompts to ask the authors to elaborate on what they had written prior to January 6:</p>
<ul>
<li>As you re-read your keyword essay in the context of recent events in Washington DC, which arguments about the usage of the term still seem most important and relevant? Which, if any, seem less germane?</li>
<li>Are there ways in which the current moment is likely to shift usage of the term? Are there new meanings or usages that have emerged?</li>
<li>Looking forward, what do you think we can/should learn about the current moment through reflection on this keyword?</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps those essays will lead you to read the full essays (also linked here) and then to look for other essays in <em>Keywords for American Cultural Studies</em>. Because—as the cover image on the book indicates—keywords books and essays are meant to be tools. They can be tools for academic analysis; they can also be tools for political understanding and organizing. These brief posts are tools in both of these ways. We hope that you and your students use them well.</p>

<p>Those members of the radical and racist right who led the Jan 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol building, vandalizing the Senate chambers and threatening members of Congress and the police force sworn to protect them, have altered the terms of public debates and collective understanding including, perhaps, our understanding of conservatism.</p>
<p>As I argue in my keyword essay, since the dawn of the 19th century there have been two overarching strands of American conservatism. The first sees itself as a philosophical bulwark against disorder, viewing hierarchies and natural forms of inequality as positive goods for healthy societies. In its Burkean pretensions it views sudden change as inherently dangerous and supports, instead, reforms that are gradual and even evolutionary in nature. In this strand, conservatives are the guardians of liberty and the defenders of our constitutional <em>Republic </em>who have histories of keeping the unruly aspects of full-fledged democracy at bay.</p>
<p>The second strand is more sinister, chaotic, and reactionary. This is the conservatism of “dark money” political machinations of those who fund and fuel the Radical Right. It is a vision of conservatism embroiled in a “deep history” of “stealth planning” to alter the rules of democratic governance. It traffics in conspiracy and disinformation often operating under the guise of grassroots political movements.</p>
<p>Both strands are united in what they understand to be an epic struggle against the forces of the Left. One the one hand, this cynically convenient marriage has not always been a happy one with each side striving to keep their distance from the other. On the other hand, in the last days of the Trump Administration, the feasibility of drawing distinctions between a conservative and a reactionary is growing more dubious by the hour in the last days of the Trump Administration.</p>
<p>In their effort to stop the certification of the 2020 Electoral College for the fraudulently contested presidential race, Republicans linked arms with Far Right forces in ways that pushed the latter from the margins to the center of conservative politics. The sporting of Confederate flags, the display of antisemitic symbols, and the noose erected on the Hill remind us of the degree to which conservatism is historically structured by race, racisms and white supremacy. The startling violence of the mob reminds us too of the lengths to which so-called defenders of the Republic are (still) willing to go to preserve the prerogatives of a white Christian nation, “under God,” when they feel threatened by liberals, leftists and nonwhite activism mobilized in the name of justice, equity and inclusion.</p>
<p>This is not the full story and meaning of conservatism. But as the Republican Party and the American Right continue to navigate the influence of Trump and Trumpism, to many present-day observers the reactionary violence is just more of what conservatism has always been but rarely admitted.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/american-cultural-studies/essay/fascism/">For a limited time, read the full keyword essay on “Fascism”</a></p>
<p>In the days following the right-wing attack on the certification of the electoral college votes in the U.S. Capitol, the debate still churns on among scholars and political commentators: “is this fascism?” As the commentary populates our social media feeds and podcast queues, it is worth considering why determining whether or not “fascism” is the accurate term for what is currently happening has become so important to so many people. Opposition to something called “fascism” represents one of the very few points of unity on both sides of the Cold War; and “fascism” has replaced “monarchy” as the “other” against which democracy is defined.  For this reason, defining something as fascism means to oppose it. The definition comes with the moral imperative: never again!</p>
<p>That moral imperative is what makes the argument over the “f-word” heated. For some leftist scholars, the argument that Trump is<em> not </em>a fascist is accompanied by arguments that neither he nor the movement around him represent a serious threat. Informed by the history of Cold War liberal anti-totalitarianism that lumped fascism and communism together as equal dangers to democracy, this group cautions against the use of the word “Fascism” to explain Trump and Trumpism. For them, the use of the word “fascism” to describe Trump is <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2020/05/19/the-trouble-with-comparisons/)">a hyperbolic or melodramatic representation</a> of the threat posed by <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/corey-robin-on-the-historovox-what-we-missed-about-trump.htm">a “weak” president</a> that places “constant pressure” on the socialist left to “deemphasize our own program” and<a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/01/trump-capitol-riot-fascist-coup-attempt"> form a coalition with neoliberals</a>.</p>
<p>In response, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-neo-fascism-takes-americas-racism-to-the-next-level">another group of leftist scholars</a> has argued that this analysis repeats the very errors of the contemporary observers of the German Nazi party. Those observers allowed fascism to grow because they saw it as weak and ridiculous, while something else – liberalism, communism, or social democracy &#8211; constituted the more serious threat. In response to arguments that Trump’s weakness means he is not a fascist, these scholars <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03071022.2016.1256592">argue</a> that fascists can fail <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-01-16/donald-trump-insurrection-capitol-beer-hall-putsch">citing as an example</a> the Munich “Beer Hall Putsch.”  What is at stake in this debate is less the definition of “fascism” than identifying the biggest political danger to be fought in the present.</p>
<p>While this argument continues, highly regarded historians of fascism continue to disagree about whether Trump is or is not a fascist based on their own long standing definitions. Such academic debates about the meaning of fascism often rest on identifying differences between different forms of authoritarian rule or ultranationalist mobilization, for while historians may agree that all fascisms are authoritarian and nationalist, few claim that all forms of authoritarianism and nationalism are fascist. Robert Paxton, leading scholar of comparative fascism who had long resisted describing Trump as a fascist, despite seeing “resemblances&#8221; <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/robert-paxton-trump-fascist-1560652">recently changed his position</a> because of the use of mass violence against the state on January 6th.</p>
<p>In contrast, Richard Evans, a leading English-language historian of Nazi Germany, <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2021/01/why-trump-isnt-fascist">argue</a><a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2021/01/why-trump-isnt-fascist">d</a> that despite the insurrection, Trump is still <em>not</em> a fascist, because for Evans the core of fascism as a quest for a fully militarized, regimented society, while Trump has publicly disrespected the military and his movement follows a “warped vision of personal freedom: a society in which people aren’t subject to government regulation or supervision, where anarchy and confusion reign.” Despite a disagreement about the core of fascism itself, both Paxton and Evans argue that Trump and Trumpism have already damaged U.S. democracy.</p>
<p>While these historians argue about the relationship of fascist movements to the state, much U.S. commentary on Trumpism as fascism points to the self-proclaimed organized white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and white nationalists who have been among Trump’s most vocal supporters from the beginning. Highly visible on January 6th, waving Confederate Flags, and wearing t-shirts bearing slogans such as “Camp Auschwitz” and “6MWE” (6 million wasn’t enough) they appear to many observers as the primary evidence that “it can happen here.” This mix of symbols and messages also indicates the extent to which the U.S. far right today blends the legacy of slavery, the Confederacy and mythology of the “Lost Cause” with later developments in far-right ideology. In this way, fascists in the United States are no different from fascists in other countries, who also draw from older national mythologies in building their narratives of great national rebirth. In my own view, Trump’s presidency has brought this American fascism closer to the center of national political power than at any time since the 1960s, whether we see Trump himself as a fascist or not.</p>
<p>Recent arguments about whether we should understand Trumpism as “native” to the U.S. or similar to a particularly “European” fascism erase the historically transnational nature of both fascism and anti-fascism. Alberto Toscano <a href="http://bostonreview.net/race-politics/alberto-toscano-long-shadow-racial-fascism">has helpfully surveyed</a> a history of what Cedric Robinson describes as the “Black construction of fascism.”  Fascism, despite being ultra-nationalist, has never been bound by national borders. Hitler modeled the Nuremberg laws on U.S Jim Crow. The U.S. advocates of ”law and order” praised Mussolini. U.S. intelligence agents supporting “White Russians” after WWI helped circulate anti-Semitic, anti-Bolshevik propaganda. The international circulation of fascist ideology has accelerated, but did not originate with the internet.</p>
<p>As we live through a global far-right resurgence whose end we cannot know, we are all discovering that knowing history &#8211; or knowing the “right” definition of a word &#8211; provides no guarantee that we will be able to understand the present with the kind of clarity we wish for. Yet, the debate about the word itself indicates the importance of historiographical argument in  contemporary political decision-making. We may not be condemned to repeat past mistakes, so much as to make new mistakes based on our incomplete understanding of a much-studied past that still remains beyond our reach.</p>

<p>Tens of millions of Americans believe that they were victims of a left-wing coup. For many of them the storming of the Capitol was a democratic act. They watched as people like themselves acted together to disrupt that supposed coup, and defend popular sovereignty. Right-wing insurgency is endlessly nourished by populist narratives that pit the &#8220;the common people&#8221; against elites, which includes both the storming of the Capitol and the pleasures of excess once inside—from feet on the desks of legislators to the wrecking of historical artifacts.</p>
<p>The bipartisan condemnations of Trump and those who besieged the Capitol have been accompanied by calls for a return to &#8220;normal,&#8221; in which the adults in the room would safeguard civility and reason and restore the authority of U.S. economic and democratic institutions from the populist mob.</p>
<p>Yet these responses play right into the hands of the very elites who rob us of the shared resources (both social and material) needed to build alternatives to Trumpism. Many sectors of the American economy where wealth is most concentrated—finance, tech, real estate, energy, military contracting—have realized enormous profits amidst Trump&#8217;s ascent. Hedge fund leaders and oil barons may object to the unseemly sight of the mob rummaging through the Capitol, but they have been materially doing much the same work for years—pillorying public resources and bending the government to serve its interests.</p>
<p>These forces do not express the crudeness and violence of those who stormed the Capitol. But a future predicated on a deference to their authority is no less dystopian, characterized as it will be by rampant wealth hoarding, growing &#8220;deaths of despair,&#8221; and cynicism towards many forms of public action and trust.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s defeat in November surely was a necessary precondition to realize new alternatives. But deferring to the economic and political elites that have set the stage for this carnage will only embolden the far right to continue to provide a kind of reactionary framing to the feelings of abandonment, isolation and betrayal, channeling those energies into ever more dangerous and violent conflicts.</p>
<p>Right-wing populism has always figured the virtuous, manly producer against some combination of those deemed parasitic or threatening, including state or economic elites, people of color, non-white immigrants, women, and gender-nonconforming people.</p>
<p>Understanding the content of right-wing populism in any given context requires an intersectional analysis of the operations of race, class, gender, and sexuality in its expression.</p>

<p>Whiteness is a useful keyword and analytical frame for understanding Trumpism, the false claims of massive voter fraud and a stolen election in 2020, and the Capitol Insurrection of January 6, 2021. As I noted in my original essay on whiteness, a discourse of “white victimhood” has long been in existence, and it has become a culturally dominant force since the 1970s. The rise of Trumpism has stoked and weaponized the grievance politics of “white victimhood.” Trump contended that Mexicans were rapists, Muslims were terrorists, and Black people were destroying cities and the suburbs would be next. Through these claims, Trump and his supporters rendered “Americans” as constant victims of an unfair and racially changing world, and because “white” is a normed and unmarked category, “American” functions as a race-neutral stand-in for “white.”</p>

<p>Whiteness is a useful keyword and analytical frame for understanding Trumpism, the false claims of massive voter fraud and a stolen election in 2020, and the Capitol Insurrection of January 6, 2021. As I noted in my original essay on whiteness, a discourse of “white victimhood” has long been in existence, and it has become a culturally dominant force since the 1970s. The rise of Trumpism has stoked and weaponized the grievance politics of “white victimhood.” Trump contended that Mexicans were rapists, Muslims were terrorists, and Black people were destroying cities and the suburbs would be next. Through these claims, Trump and his supporters rendered “Americans” as constant victims of an unfair and racially changing world, and because “white” is a normed and unmarked category, “American” functions as a race-neutral stand-in for “white.”</p>
<p>I also find Cristina Beltrán’s formulation of “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/01/15/understand-trumps-support-we-must-think-terms-multiracial-whiteness/">multiracial whiteness</a>” helpful in understanding the current conjuncture, Trump’s appeal to select voters of color, and how some people of color have aligned themselves with white supremacy. Beltrán argues that the whiteness of this moment is not a homogenous “racial whiteness” but an ideological “multiracial whiteness.” Beltrán deploys the concept of “multiracial whiteness” to explain how people of color like Ali Alexander, who contributed to the Stop the Steal movement, and Enrique Tarrio, a leader of the Proud Boys, could align themselves with white nationalists.  For Beltrán, “Multiracial whiteness reflects an understanding of whiteness as a political color and not simply a racial identity &#8211; a discriminatory worldview in which feelings of freedom and belonging are produced through the persecution and dehumanization of others.”</p>
<p>The origins of whiteness and its relationship may also offer insights into the recent insurrection. To many the rioting and violence of hundreds of Trump supporters in the U.S. Capitol appeared to be a desecration of democracy and violation of its norms. Yet, if one considers how white supremacy was central to shaping the contours of U.S. citizenship, the rioting at the Capitol is a continuation of an American tradition. Here, I find Joel Olson’s <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-abolition-of-white-democracy">historicization of whiteness and citizenship</a> particularly useful. Like Beltrán, Olson frames whiteness not as a racial category but as a political one. Drawing upon Edmund Morgan, Joel Olson illustrates how voting and rioting were twin elements of an antebellum citizenship rooted in whiteness. Like Trump’s Capitol insurrectionists, early American rioters “took themselves to be protectors of republican institutions. Mob leaders presented themselves as patriots—several claimed to have ancestors who came over on the Mayflower—while mobs christened themselves with names like the Sons of Liberty and the Minutemen” (32).</p>
<p>If we keep in mind these origins of what Olson terms “white citizenship,” then Trumpism, the Capitol Insurrection, and its potential aftershocks will not look like aberrations of U.S. history. “Multiracial whiteness” may appear confounding and novel at first glance, but it is truly a new version of the old story of  “white citizenship.”</p>
