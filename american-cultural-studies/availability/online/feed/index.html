				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At once universal and specific, transcendent as well as deeply historical, the property of individual feeling but also affecting the mass subject, “aesthetics” has been notoriously difficult to define. This imprecision explains why aesthetics have often been invoked as a progressive force that opens new conceptual horizons and just as often derided as a tired elitist dodge that preserves the status quo. The unevenness of the ground on which matters of beauty, perception, taste, and the sublime stand results from elemental fissures between art and politics. Such fissures may be more fantasy than actuality, however. When aesthetics are considered in terms of social practice, philosophy, and cultural criticism, they appear as profoundly material engagements with embodiment, collectivity, and social life.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Aesthetics are in their narrowest sense purely about the discernment of formal criteria such as unity, proportion, and balance within the domain of art. If we trace the term’s origins back to the German Romantic tradition of Immanuel Kant and Friedrich von Schiller, aesthetics seem a philosophical topic rather than a cultural conjuncture. Yet even this narrow sense resounds with expansive political and social possibilities. Schiller ([1794] 1954, 25) correlates aesthetic education with “true political freedom,” and Kant ([1790] 1952) orients aesthetic judgment around a shared sensibility that would hold true for all individuals, engendering feelings of the universal. This utopian potential found practical application in the reformist energies of the City Beautiful movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which attempted to unify, uplift, and, perhaps most crucially, “Americanize” the heterogeneous populations of urban immigrants. Theoretically, this emphasis on universality and transformation found its expression in the work of John Dewey ([1934] 1980), who construed aesthetic experience as a vital encounter that challenged the fixity of custom and precedent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These historical and theoretical currents merged in the efforts of pragmatists such as Jane Addams who, like Dewey, sought to make beauty and art a common feature of the modern social landscape. By linking magic lantern shows, art exhibitions, drama clubs, poetry readings, and lectures on art to the cultivation of social ethics, reformers hoped that aesthetics could play a generative role in the democratization of culture. By the start of the twentieth century, this repertoire expanded to include moving pictures, which were often heralded as the first truly mass art form. A central question for the political and cultural projects of both American studies and cultural studies is whether aesthetics can continue to play that role.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The narrow sense of aesthetics as a discourse on art thus leads almost inevitably to broader usages that understand the term to denote the entire “corporeal sensorium,” including affect and emotion, pain and pleasure, feeling and sensibility (Buck-Morss 1992, 5). This emphasis on broad human reactions and responses suggests the potential force of commonality as a universal feeling that collides with and energizes political positions. One way of understanding this emergence of the political within the aesthetic is to say that Kant’s idea of </span><span class="s2"><i>sensus communis</i></span><span class="s1"> ([1790] 1952), a common standard of aesthetic judgment in which individual perception tallies with general taste, recalls Thomas Paine’s notion of “common sense” ([1776] 1953), which marshals public sentiment for the purposes of revolution. Structured by familiar responses and shared stimuli, aesthetics represent the possibility of mass mobilization. Emanations of aesthetic politics—including worker rallies, carnivals, street theater, and mass demonstrations—challenge notions of the public sphere as a zone of rational debate and suggest the importance of performance and play to progressive social movements (Tucker 2010). But such actions echo with political ambivalence; even as collective feeling resounds with democratic energy, the hum of a mass unified—and manipulated—by emotion also carries more ominous overtones of totalitarian control, as Walter Benjamin ([1936] 1968) predicted in his famous essay on mechanical reproduction in the context of the rise of National Socialism in Germany. Since this dire prediction about a fascist future, scholars of the United States’ past along with critics of aesthetics have reflected on the conflicted intersections among art, beauty, and democracy (Castronovo 2007; Greiman 2010; Rancière 2010; Scarry 2001).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the nineteenth-century United States, the potentially transformative effects of aesthetic feeling in galvanizing political opinion appeared in literary sentimentalism. Animating a host of reforms from temperance to women’s rights, sentimentalism figured prominently in the antislavery crusade, culminating in Harriet Beecher Stowe’s directive that individuals confronted with the awesome task of defeating the monster of slavery begin by making sure that “they feel right” ([1852] 1981, 624). Individual by individual, citizens could build a </span><span class="s2"><i>sensus communis</i></span><span class="s1"> that would change the world. The problem, of course, was that individual feeling could remain individualized, forever private, and never connected to shared action or thought. Indeed, Ralph Waldo Emerson, in the poem that introduces his essay “Art,” seemed to imply that when art touches us, it reconciles and adjusts the individual to the social world as it is instead of reshaping the world in accordance with a common regard for justice or fairness. The duty of art, according to Emerson’s couplet, is “Man in Earth to acclimate, / And bend the exile to his fate” (1983, 429). Here, the politics that aesthetics produce come in the mode of resignation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Identifying Emerson with this one-dimensional position ignores his belief that beauty could reinvent ordinary forms of social life. But it was a belief that took hold in the twentieth century among the New Critics, who stressed aesthetics as a formal mechanism of order and stability. “Aesthetic forms are a technique of restraint,” announced John Crowe Ransom (1965, 31), advancing the position that the human rush to action, overflow of emotion, and unpredictable stir of social life could all be reined in by beauty and our responses to it. Cast in this fashion, beauty and art become the conservative guarantors of the social world as it is and not sources for how it might be reimagined and reformed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These lingering effects of social governance and political containment are what motivate some American studies and cultural studies scholars to critique aesthetics as a conservative strategy of retrenchment that justifies art’s putative evasion of political matters, mystifies class privilege as disinterestedness, and uses ideas of harmony and unity to excuse the status quo. As Sacvan Bercovitch and Myra Jehlen framed the issue in their landmark collection </span><span class="s2"><i>Ideology and Classic American Literature</i></span><span class="s1"> (1986), the concentration on artistic qualities and literary effects among previous generations of critics diminished both the social impetus and the radical potential of literature. If we attend to the historicity of beauty and form, as this case against aesthetics goes, the scales of appreciation will drop from our eyes to reveal aesthetics as an evasion of culture. While this assessment is dead-on, it finds its target only by aiming at notions of aesthetics that are themselves culturally thin, cut off from larger—and potentially alternative—histories of form, emotion, and representation. In short, the cultural critique of aesthetics risks overlooking varied strategies of interpretation, expression, and collaboration enabled by the aesthetic project itself. As a central term for American studies and cultural studies, “aesthetics” enables a questioning of the forms by which we organize domains of politics and art in the first place.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a term that designates the physical or material frame of human and other living beings, “body” has a long career in the language and a relatively brief one as a focus of critical engagement in the study of culture. For Christian theology as for speculative philosophy in the West, the body figures as the devalued term in a structuring dualism of body/soul (in sacred thought) and body/mind (in secular traditions). These dualisms apprehend the body as a material substrate of human life that is fundamentally distinct from and subordinated to the privileged term in the dichotomy (mind, soul), which alone comprehends the human capacity for knowledge and self-knowledge as well as the repertoire of human sensibilities, dispositions, and affects on which the salvation, expression, or advancement of humanity is understood to depend. In Christian theology as in humanist philosophy, the body turns up on the side of animality or merely mechanical existence and so dwells outside the bounded domain of what is proper or essential to human culture, a domain that the exclusion of the body guarantees.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the same time, classic political economy and social contract theory grant the body a certain limited dignity as the organic container of human personhood. For social contract theory, the body constitutes the inalienable property of human subjects. To sell oneself bodily is tantamount to selling one’s self, to an erasure of personhood that, paradoxically, would suspend the seller’s ability to enter into such a contract in the first place. In this way, social contract theory affirms the rationality and justice of wage labor (the selling of one’s capacity for physical or intellectual labor) by setting a specific limit on the attributes of personhood that may circulate in the marketplace. The claim to an inalienable property in the body animated moral opposition to chattel slavery in the New World, although as David Brion Davis (1975) has argued, abolitionism was at least as much an apology for the immiseration of wage labor under industrial capitalism as it was an indictment of slavery and plantation economics. For Marxist political economy (in contrast to the classic political economy of Locke), the very distinction between alienable labor and inalienable embodiment cannot hold, as the abstraction of labor from the embodied person of the laborer makes possible the theft of his or her energy and creativity in the production of value to which the laborer loses all claim. Marxism is certainly the major intellectual tradition before the twentieth century to understand human creativity and the production of value as fully bound up in the materiality of embodied life. It refuses the dichotomization of body and soul, of matter and spirit, that otherwise dominates philosophical and theological inquiry in the West.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the other main sense of the term relevant to contemporary cultural study, the body may be understood as a collective entity, “an artificial person created by legal authority for certain ends” (e.g., a corporation), or a political entity, a “body politic,” which in its widest sense may signify “organized society” as such (</span><span class="s2"><i>Oxford English Dictionary</i></span><span class="s1"> [</span><span class="s2"><i>OED</i></span><span class="s1">]). This meaning of the term is of more modern provenance (the </span><span class="s2"><i>OED</i></span><span class="s1"> cites 1461 as the first recorded usage of “bodie corporate” and 1634 of “body politic”). As the product of legal discourse and political theory, the use of “body” to reference abstract collectivity is from its origins at once descriptive and analytic. In the twentieth century, the European tradition of the history of ideas began to give this analytical concept an expressly culturalist turn by framing the study of political bodies as a question about the iconography of power. This historiographical tradition considers how figuring institutionalized political power and identity as corporeal animates these abstractions; the power of the monarchical state is an abstraction remote from the lives of ordinary subjects who submit to its authority, but the sacred body of the king is an awesome iconic image that can be widely disseminated across the ranks of a stratified social order (Kantorowicz 1957; Starobinski 1988).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This type of critical reflection on the embodiment of political authority comes belatedly to American studies, perhaps because of the insistence in US law and political theory on divorcing political bodies from most forms of sensational corporeality and so rendering them as pure abstractions. The reflections on the appropriate size of the representative bodies of government in the </span><span class="s2"><i>Federalist Papers</i></span><span class="s1">, for example, underscore how such political bodies were </span><span class="s2"><i>not</i></span><span class="s1"> conceived as the practical means to reproduce the </span><span class="s2"><i>agora</i></span><span class="s1"> of the ancient Greek democracies in a modern state, where size and population make impossible the massing of all its citizens in any one physical space. Rather than an abridgment of this embodied totality of citizens thronging the </span><span class="s2"><i>agora</i></span><span class="s1">, the representative bodies arrayed in the US Constitution were envisioned as different sorts of bodies altogether, purged of the mass physicality of the crowd. In the early national period, to claim political authority in civic matters required that one speak in the guise of disinterested reason, rather than render one’s particular viewpoint, so that print became the privileged medium of public debate, exactly because it detached the voice of the author from the evident partiality or particularity of his or her embodied person (M. Warner 1990). Citizenship on this model is an ideally </span><span class="s2"><i>disembodied</i></span><span class="s1"> identity, while citizens’ bodies remain a private matter.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Critical attention to forms of material and abstract embodiment in American studies has been fostered through its interface with feminism, race and ethnic studies, and postcolonial studies. These critical projects enable a turn to those human subjects who have been historically associated with the discredited life of the material body and so constituted as marginal to the arenas of cultural production and political representation: women, Africans and their New World descendants, indigenous peoples, mestizos, and Asians, among other categories of “overembodied” ethnic, sexual, and classed identity. As American studies emerges transformed from this intellectual contact zone, it has addressed how collective and impersonal forms of political agency are routinely embodied in propertied white men, whose political privilege depends on the association of other genders, races, and classes with corporealized identities. The circulation of such “overembodied” identities as public icons and spectacle has been crucial to the protection of established political privilege. At the same time, the visibility of disqualified political subjects within public culture has also generated important opportunities for contesting their disqualification.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Minimally, these contestations require a denaturalized understanding of the physical body as a social text rather than a given form. While some critical accounts of embodiment continue to honor this distinction by framing the human body as a quantity of physical matter imprinted with social meaning, theories of performative identity reject the idea of a natural body altogether. Judith Butler’s (1990) account of performative gender is one example. It suggests that the sexed body does not precede its social realization as a gendered person but rather that its material configuration is itself an </span><span class="s2"><i>effect</i></span><span class="s1"> of gender norms that operate through imitation. We “assume” a gender through the repeated bodily enactment of intelligible gendered identity, and it is this repetitious performance that constitutes the body in its very physicality (in its boundaries and receptivities; in the sensational geography of its surfaces). In this view, there are no bodies </span><span class="s2"><i>without</i></span><span class="s1"> culture, since the body as a kind of material composition requires a cultural </span><span class="s2"><i>grammar</i></span><span class="s1"> of embodiment. Although theories of performative identity have been most influential in the study of gender and sexuality, significant intellectual ground has also been broken in the study of race, ethnicity, and class as performative embodiments (Lott 1993; Muñoz 1999; Foster 1999).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The turn to cultural studies within American studies has also fostered critical attention on forms of public and political corporeality, particularly the orientation of cultural studies to mass culture. Because mass culture insistently links abstract identity to iconic embodiment, it proliferates the public bodies evacuated from early national political culture. The norms of commercial and political culture in the United States are thus historically at odds, yet today the life of the body politic is entirely transacted within the mass media, which may help explain the contemporary salience of identity politics as well as the tendency to stake claims for political recognition on the basis of embodied particularity. But mass culture also circulates bodies promiscuously; its technologies and commercial logic ensure the production of desirable body images made available to the widest market. Access to particular corporeal identities becomes paradoxically generalized; within mass culture, one can “have” (identify with or as) iconic forms of gendered, racial, ethnic, sexual, or classed embodiment that have no necessary relation to the cultural consumer’s assigned (“natural”) body. (In virtual environments, for instance, a white, middle-class man might adopt the avatar of a working-class Asian woman.) Much of the contemporary scholarship on US political culture, then, draws on notions of performative identity to parse the ways in which identity politics entail a </span><span class="s2"><i>contest</i></span><span class="s1"> over the grammar of embodiment (Spillers 1987; Harper 1994; Berlant 1997). The central question that arises from this new scholarship concerns which subjects will claim what forms of embodiment and with what effects.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Were we to imagine an earlier iteration of this keywords project—one published around, say, 1989—“border” would most likely have been left off the list entirely, though “margin” or maybe “minor” might well have been included. In the intervening years, as violent border conflicts erupted across the world and as the US government heavily militarized its border with Mexico, the term has become prominent in academic work. Accounting for this shift—understanding the concept’s fortunes, as it were—entails movement among academic concerns, theoretical conversations, and sociopolitical and economic developments over the last quarter of the twentieth century and the first decade of the twenty-first. To be sure, a loosely defined field of “border studies” has been around in some form or another since Frederick Jackson Turner ([1893] 1920) argued for the significance of the frontier and Herbert Eugene Bolton (1921) published </span><span class="s2"><i>The Spanish Borderlands: A Chronicle of Old Florida and the Southwest</i></span><span class="s1"> and certainly since the end of World War II, when regional area studies began to receive sustained governmental support. During this period, the most prominent borders were located between East and West Germany, North and South Vietnam, and the officially segregated US South and the unofficially segregated US North. By the mid-1980s, however, the United States had failed in its effort to maintain the border between North and South Vietnam, segregation had been rendered illegal if not eliminated in practice, and efforts to dismantle the border between East and West Germany were gaining momentum. At the same time, philosophers, artists, novelists, and scholars who had been meditating on the less prominent international border between Mexico and the United States began to gain broad attention and to publish significant new work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That new work emerged along with the effort to create a North American Free Trade Zone, the subsequent Zapatista revolutionary response, the acceleration of other globalizing forces, and the attendant anxieties these forces generated among citizenry of various nations. These tendencies led to political and grassroots efforts to further militarize national borders, to narrow access to citizenship, and to withdraw humane support for workers without papers. Borders were very much in the news because of the ongoing violence of national borders around the world, particularly in regions immediately affected by the breakup of the Soviet Union, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the continuing impact of anticolonial struggles, and regional economic recessions. Furthermore, during this period, capital accelerated its transition from its base in the nation-state to a new global scale that entailed more flexible modes of accumulation and citizenship. Under a series of new trade agreements, national borders no longer contained national economies as they had in prior decades. This economic shift accelerated a broad new series of global flows of capital, resources, jobs, and people across national and regional borders. Alongside these developments, researchers in African American and postcolonial studies, feminist theory, poststructuralism, and the cultural studies of the Birmingham school, attuned to the experiences of exile and diaspora, drew attention to the manner in which various kinds of borders are made and unmade (C. Fox 1999; Derrida 1993). Thus scholars became particularly interested in the theoretical analyses of Chicano and Chicana intellectuals who connected the study of ethnicity, racialization, and immigration to empire building, imperialism, and international relations (Paredes 1958; Gutiérrez-Jones 1995; Saldívar 1997).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Perhaps most significant among these new border theorists was the late philosopher Gloria Anzaldúa. Already well known among feminists of color as co-editor of the groundbreaking anthology </span><span class="s2"><i>This Bridge Called My Back</i></span><span class="s1"> (Moraga and Anzaldúa 1981), Anzaldúa, in </span><span class="s2"><i>Borderlands / La Frontera: The New Mestiza</i></span><span class="s1"> (1987), mapped the violence of US colonialism, patriarchy, and capitalism by exploring some historical aspects of the Texas-Mexico border. In doing so, Anzaldúa drew attention to the violent history of anti-Mexican racism, noting the borderland rapes, murders, land grabs, and police detentions largely ignored in standard US histories. At the same time, she roundly critiqued what she saw as misogynist and homophobic practices prevalent in both Anglo and Mexican cultures (Saldívar-Hull 2000). In a brilliant act of reappropriation, she mined the term “border,” unveiling its metaphoricity in an effort to envision the impact of the material border in less degrading and more sustainable ways. In keeping with the critical theoretical work of other feminists of color, Anzaldúa questioned the production and maintenance of binaries, their exclusionary force, and the maxims that suggest that living with contradiction necessarily entails psychosis. Instead, she mobilized a second spatial metaphor—that of the borderlands or </span><span class="s2"><i>la frontera</i></span><span class="s1">—to insist that one can embrace multiple contradictions and refuse the impossible effort to synthesize them fully, thus turning apparent oppositions into sources of insight and personal strength.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rapidly disseminated in the United States and elsewhere, this concept of the borderlands or </span><span class="s2"><i>la frontera</i></span><span class="s1"> enabled other writers to consider culture not through a dominant narrative of synthesis but from a more subaltern perspective of heterogeneity and messiness. “The borderlands are physically present,” Anzaldúa (1987, 19) writes, “wherever two or more cultures edge each other, where people of different races occupy the same territory, where under, lower, middle and upper classes touch, where the space between two individuals shrinks with intimacy.” This deliberately universalizing turn provided a language for discussing differences while invoking an imaginary geography. It allowed other scholars and performance artists to build on Anzaldúa’s insights, focusing particularly on the conceptual possibilities contained in metaphors of borders, border crossings, and borderlands. Some, such as Guillermo Gómez-Peña (1990), Néstor García Canclini (1995), and Homi K. Bhabha (1994), found much to celebrate in the hybridizing effects of borders. They too argued for the latent power and innovative possibilities of conflictive regions and binaries and suggested that working with contradictions—drawing humor and insight from them rather than repressing or resolving them—would challenge an epistemological structure that enabled economic oppression, racism, misogyny, and homophobia.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Border” subsequently became a common analytical tool and reference point for scholars working across the fields of American studies, romanticism, medieval history, and cultural studies more generally (Aparicio 2003). Prominent journals of critical theory and philosophy organized special issues around the theme of “borders.” At the same time, global corporate elites celebrated the arrival of a world in which national borders appeared no longer to prohibit the movement of people and material. Since these celebrations of a borderless world often occurred at the very moment when nations enacted economic blockades and restricted the informal movements of poor people across national borders, the contradictory function of borders could not be ignored. These contradictions highlighted the extent to which militarized borders have become crucial to capital management—they serve as revenue producers for states, as wage depressers for corporations, and as mechanisms for tying bodies to state power. In short, geopolitical borders have become both abjection machines and state-sponsored aesthetic projects in which states authorize and decorate their own sovereignty (M. Brady 2000, 2002; P. Villa 2003; De Genova 2002; Salter 2006).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Within academic research in particular, the term “border” began to do some very peculiar work. Because of its simultaneous material and metaphoric resonances, “border” could be used to locate an argument by apparently materializing it while often dislocating it from any historically specific geopolitical referents. Such a function might not have been so available had borders not been regularly the subject of news reports. Because of the unending violence of many geopolitical borders, including the thousands of people who have died attempting to cross the Mexico-US border, scholars could use the term and implicitly invoke its violence without documenting or narrating that violence with any real precision (Berestein 2005). Beginning with a geopolitical term, border theorists have developed an epistemological approach equally cognizant of “real” borders and of their fantastic, fantastically violent effects.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And yet it must be noted that the sociopolitical transformations of the first decade of the twenty-first century have added still further nuance to the keyword. Technological and regulatory changes have shifted state power such that the border that Anzaldúa so famously characterized as an “open wound” no longer exists (Schmidt Camacho 2008). It is mobile; it follows us around. Or as Gilberto Rosas (2006) argues, the border has “thickened.” In order to accommodate the deterritorialization of capital and wealth, the border’s traditional work as an instantiation of sovereignty over a territory and citizenry has been irrevocably dislocated, unmoored from its Cartesian coordinates through practices that combine policing and emergency services, schooling, and banking with immigration law enforcement. The border is now a process far more than a place. This rescaling of “border” challenges its </span><span class="s2"><i>tocaya</i></span><span class="s1">, or twin term—“citizen”—at the very moment when activists and scholars have begun to question the viability of the pact between state and subject that “citizen” articulates and that borders instantiate (Schmidt Camacho 2010; Boyce Davies and M’Bow 2007; Otiono 2011; Sassen 2009; Waligora-Davis 2011). Should such efforts succeed in dismantling the structures of national citizenship and establishing a global citizenry with universal rights, the border in many of its manifestations will be drained of its power.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Raymond Williams (1973) demonstrated the overarching significance of the keywords “city” and “country,” establishing the simultaneously positive and negative inflections of urbanity and rurality. For urbanity, on the positive side were the values of learning, light, progress, civilization, cosmopolitanism, tolerance and civil liberties, excitement, and sophistication; on the negative lay the countervalues of sin, darkness and noise, corruption and devolution, danger and violence, irreligion, mob rule, and anomie—in short, urban modernity and its discontents.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As Williams noted, these city/country oppositions are always invoked in the service of political interests. Diverse social actors described European and, later, US urban life in ways that shifted and evolved with cities themselves. Troubadours, priests, ministers, and Romantic poets gave way to flaneurs and other urban observers, who then gave way to social statisticians, settlement-house workers, novelists, playwrights, journalists, photographers, and painters. The new social scientists and artists took cities and urban dwellers as their research objects, as problems to be solved, and as material to be dramatized. In this thrifty recycling of tropes, a set of symbolic associations arose linking the European and American urban poor to colonized others through their mutual need for instruction from their betters (di Leonardo 1998). The voluminous writings of missionaries, journalists, and reformers in Victorian Britain provided a template for later US constructions of “urban jungles” filled with the “near-savage” poor. Socialist novelist Jack London (1903, 288), in an account of life among East London’s homeless at the time of Edward’s coronation, declared passionately that it was “far better to be a people of the wilderness and desert, of the cave and the squatting-place, than to be a people of the machine and the Abyss.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The long history of North American and US urban imaginaries include the Puritan vision of the blessed gathering of the elect as a “city on a hill”; the revolutionary republican associations attached to Boston and Philadelphia; the new nation’s classically planned capital of Washington, DC; and diverse nineteenth-century texts that American studies pioneer Leo Marx ([1964] 2000) cataloged under the heading of the “machine in the garden,” a trope he used to link industrialization, urbanization, and pastoralism. The nineteenth century brought the westward expansion of the new republic and the rapid growth of New York and Boston, the legal end of slavery and the first “great migration” of freed men and women to northern cities, the rapid rise of capitalist industrialization and its associated second major wave of labor migration from Europe and Asia, the first wave of the women’s movement and of homegrown radicalisms hatched in urban environments, and US imperial actions in the Caribbean, Latin America, and the Pacific, all of which created bridges for future migration to US cities. These historical developments, along with many others, were connected to vast urban growth fueled by external and internal migration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dominant urban imaginaries reflected and interpreted these sea changes. The “Chicago school” social scientists, from the 1910s forward, tended to envision inevitable progress as repeated waves of migrants of every nationality first settled in center cities and then moved to outer and suburban rings as they experienced upward social mobility. This narrative credited poor and nonwhite urban dwellers with civility and the capacity for self-organization. Other scholars, journalists, and artists focused instead on the dirt, pollution, noise, and overcrowding of rapidly expanding US cities, though from contrasting political perspectives. Progressives such as Upton Sinclair ([1906] 1988) described the capitalist exploitation of downtrodden urban dwellers and the corrupt urban machines (such as New York’s infamous Tammany Hall) that failed to ameliorate their lot. Their opponents, such as Madison Grant (1916), envisioned cities as cesspools harboring the genetically unfit and overly procreative, particularly Italians, Irish, Jews, and Slavs and other southeastern European immigrants. The associations of these new immigrants with poverty, crime, disease, and hyperfertility have been recycled across the decades to apply to populations now construed as “racial,” particularly blacks, Latinos, and in the Trump era, Muslims. Related associations of urban worlds and their racialized populations with sexual danger and “perversion” have obscured the role that cities have played in women’s emancipation and interracial and queer community building since at least the nineteenth century (Chauncey 1994; Mumford 1997; Delany 2001).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the same time, mainstream social scientists continue to frame sexual and racial forms of capitalist exploitation as expressions of cultural difference and pathology. Counterempirical descriptions of a “culture of poverty” in the 1960s shifted in the 1980s into a contrast between the “urban underclass” and new “model minorities” (largely new Asian and select Latino migrants), even as urban renewal projects destroyed low-cost housing. “Asphalt jungles” gave way to “welfare queens” and journalistic hysteria over inner-city crime, drugs, and gangs. Replicating the oppositional structure of earlier figurations, the late twentieth century saw the rise of rap, hip-hop, and break dancing and the marketing of the virtues of urban “diversity,” even as gentrification was raising real estate values in minority neighborhood after neighborhood, thus pricing out those “diverse” populations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The global neoliberal shift of the 1980s forward—the wholesale privatization of public goods and cutbacks in all social programs combined with an identity-based reading of human rights—and US imperial responses to global terrorism have further complicated urban representations and realities. Among the factors reconfiguring US urban life are the representation of cities as targets of terrorist attacks and the related stigmatization of Muslims/Arabs/Sikhs; the uncertainty occasioned by ongoing global economic volatility, sovereign debt crises, and continuous capitalist “creative destruction” (Harvey 2005); and the explosion of “urban contemporary” (black and Latino) music, dance, and fashion. The associated rise of social-media-based urban organizing has shaped responses to these developments, including demonstrations for “the right to the city” (Mitchell 2003) and against racist, xenophobic, and misogynist discrimination and violence such as those organized by Black Lives Matter and Ultraviolet. The hypergentrification of urban and suburban housing markets, the development of urban cores as tourist destinations, and the production of a touristified vision of urban functioning all contribute to what Matthew Ruben labels the “suburban optic” a way of seeing the city through suburbanized eyes (di Leonardo 2008; Ruben 2002; Zukin 2010). Simultaneously, the development of a network of “global cities”—New York, London, and Tokyo, among others—centralized the administration of finance capital (Sassen 1991).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The arrival of the Trump administration did not exactly initiate a new set of urban representations—all of its elements predated 2016—but under Trump, these tendencies have grown exponentially. For progressives, cities are now seen as sheltering and nurturing people of color; immigrants (“sanctuary cities”); lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) populations; feminist women and men; and resistance to racist, masculinist, and heterosexist visions of US democracy. For reactionaries, US cities now represent these “evil,” “immoral,” and specifically “un-American” populations—people who should be excised from the body politic to “make America great again.” As the twenty-first century proceeds, cities continue to serve as metonyms of both nations and their discontents.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Civilization” refers to an ideal perpetually contested, a condition perpetually threatened, and a practice perpetually prescribed. It is a term employed by academics and cultural theorists, policy pundits, and government officials in the United States and around the world. In the view of R. G. Collingwood (1971) and a host of lesser defenders of “Western heritage,” it is the political order and cultural treasure of the West threatened by totalitarian, proletarian, and jihadist barbarities. It is the globally exportable condition of social development promoted by the United Nations Civil Society Organizations and Participation Programme. It is the seductive discipline of decorum prescribed by colonizing powers on subaltern populations critiqued in Homi K. Bhabha’s essay “Sly Civility” (1994). It is an abstract set of conditions, found in any number of world cultures throughout history, described by sociologists such as Benjamin Nelson (1973) and Stanford M. Lyman (1990).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These various usages have long jostled in print and public media. Yet they share a common history that was initially concerned with distinguishing the different social conditions discovered by Europe’s early modern exploration of the world and by the development of the empirical investigation of the past. The word was born of the Enlightenment, fathered by Victor Riqueti Mirabeau in </span><span class="s2"><i>L’ami des homes</i></span><span class="s1"> ([1756–58] 1970) to demarcate those societies that embraced civil law and put aside military rule as a means of constraining violence. Not all of its subsequent usages have escaped the Enlightenment tendency to conceive matters in the form of binary oppositions. Yet its first usage in English resulted from the desire to go beyond the conventional opposition between civil and uncivil.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Civilization” emerged in English sometime in the 1760s or 1770s, adapted from the French </span><span class="s2"><i>civilisation</i></span><span class="s1"> to supplant the phrase “civil life.” Since the time of the anonymous 1579 treatise </span><span class="s2"><i>Of Cyuil and Uncyuil Life</i></span><span class="s1">, English authors had debated whether rural simplicity or urbanity made a subject better able to serve the Crown. Civil life referred here to the harmonious incorporation of the subject into the public world of a nation and presupposed an effective traditional culture. The final decades of the eighteenth century made the question of civility broader than the formation of serviceable political subjects in a given nation. The revolutionary social and political agitations in British America and France framed the condition of the citizenry (as distinguished from a realm of subjects) in the generalities of abstract rights, universal laws, and utopian institutions. “Civilization” came into prominence in the discourse of the French Revolution, where it named an enduring cultural and communal organization more fundamental than the political constitution of the state, more reasonable than the cultus of religion, and more engaged with the potential for creative human action than jurisprudence.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Civilization” thus began to operate in tension with “culture,” “nation,” “barbarity,” and “rural primitivism.” It now owed less to “civil life” than to “civility,” a term that spoke of an orderliness and integrity of society that enabled the conversation and commerce of various classes and orders within a community. “Civility” had a more inclusive and normative character than the older courtly value of courtesy. It also had a range of applications extending beyond one’s own community. Externally, “civility” stood in contrast with the disorders and social simplicity of “savagery”; it enabled conversation, diplomacy, and trade between peoples. Internally, “civility” spoke of the condition of a people at one moment in time. “Civilization,” in distinction, invoked a narrative of development or progress that depended on a stage-based theory of civil refinement.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This narrative became popular in the wake of early modern explorations of the world. Contacts with illiterate, pastoral peoples who had mastered the smelting and casting of iron set Europeans pondering the characteristics of civility. The capacity of “savage peoples” to learn technology and understand European concepts, coupled with the Europeans’ wish to incorporate these peoples as laborers and suppliers in Western imperial commerce, suggested that such persons were in a more primitive state of development. For these savage peoples to attain civilization meant that they must be educated into the arts of peace and commerce. The example of China, which Enlightenment philosophers recognized as an integral civilization, further indicated that the history of development might have more than one trajectory. (In the mid-twentieth century, Arnold Joseph Toynbee enumerated twenty-one separate civilizations in his influential twelve-volume </span><span class="s2"><i>The Study of History</i></span><span class="s1"> [1934–61].)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sociologist Norbert Elias ([1939] 1969) described the mechanism that underlay these cultural and societal developments in the early modern West as the “civilizing process.” Elias saw this process as occurring in two cultural registers. In the nation-states of the West, a regime of masculine power centered in monarchy, and a martial aristocracy, operating under an ethic of honor and valor, was transformed into a “civil society” centered in social institutions outside the royal court, where conflict was sublimated in contests of aesthetic display, gentility, and heterosocial conversation. Outside of these nation-states, particularly in places seen as lacking literacy, centralized government, social order, and law, civilization involved a process of acculturation, enabled by commerce and the exchange of knowledge, in which civil society was created and developed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In contrast to many of the writers Elias surveyed, he was careful to speak of process, not progress. He described a development, not a scheme of evolution or perfection. Elias thus argued for the second of two models of civil improvement that have long contended: the utopian and the processive. In the former, a civil community is perfected in accord with an ideal; in the latter, civilization is a process with an implicit but unprogrammatic tendency. The French Revolution brought the conflict between these two views into the open. The Enlightenment philosopher the Marquis de Condorcet, in </span><span class="s2"><i>Esquisse d’un tableau historique des progrès de l’esprit humain</i></span><span class="s1"> (1795), viewed civilization as culminating in a perfection of human knowledge, spirit, and will. The problem with this model of civilization—of utopia as a program of social change—was announced in the ironic title of the masterwork of revolutionary wit composed by one of its partisans and victims, the collection of aphorisms titled </span><span class="s2"><i>Produits de la civilisation perfectionée</i></span><span class="s1"> by Nicolas Chamfort (1984). Perfected civilization for Chamfort was vanity institutionalized and enforced by the coercive power of the state.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the wake of the French Revolution, literary Romanticism, disillusioned by the political fallout of the Enlightenment, complicated the resulting dialectics of civilization and savagery, civility and barbarity. Romantic suspicion of civilization can be traced to Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s celebration of the primitive in </span><span class="s2"><i>Discourse on Inequality</i></span><span class="s1"> ([1754] 1984). Civilization’s attributes—urbanity, politeness, commerce—became associated with corruptions of man. In Romantic ideology, nature and individual human genius became the counterforces to civilization. In Europe, this Romantic ideology spawned a politics of anarchism. In the United States, a less overtly political version of Romantic individualism found expression in canonical writings ranging from Ralph Waldo Emerson’s “The American Scholar” ([1837] 1990) to Mark Twain’s </span><span class="s2"><i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i></span><span class="s1"> ([1885] 1985).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, the utopian impulses unleashed by the Enlightenment were not halted by the Romantic cult of nature. A faith in the capacity of humans to intervene in history drove various experiments in utopian community and nation building. “Civilization” became a set of programs applied to myriad peoples and nations, from social communes in the US hinterlands to blueprints for European and Latin American revolutions. “Civilization” became one of the keywords in debates over the character of the new nations created by the independence movements in South America. Domingo F. Sarmiento ([1845] 2004), in his classic </span><span class="s2"><i>Civilization and Barbarism</i></span><span class="s1">, praised the liberalism, urbanity, and creativity of his native Argentina’s cities against the political and cultural legacy of the </span><span class="s2"><i>pampa</i></span><span class="s1">, where ignorance, authoritarianism, and rigid custom ruled. Sarmiento anticipated many nineteenth- and twentieth-century thinkers in his use of “civilization” as an ideal from which to criticize the “nation.” Conversely, José Martí in “Our America” ([1891] 2002) identified “civilization” as the counterforce of liberty, a trace of colonial ideology, and a synonym for luxury. The debate between Sarmiento and Martí typifies Romantic agony over civilization in its linkage of civilization with the question of national destiny. Post-Romantic politics posed civilization as the other by which the limits of nationhood might be revealed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the manifestations and expressions of nationalism became increasingly extreme in the twentieth century, thinkers embraced the nonprogrammatic sense of civilization to counter the rhetoric of state self-glorification. R. G. Collingwood and other critics described the nationalist self-celebration of Germany under National Socialism and fascist Spain as “anticivilizational.” Collingwood memorably redefined the term “barbarity,” retiring its traditional sense of alien crudity and supplying in its stead the willful selfishness and philistinism of a modern nation-state.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the same time, the nonprogrammatic view of civilization developed descriptive and critical uses. Émile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss argued in their “Note on the Notion of Civilization” ([1913] 1971) that certain phenomena have long existed that are “supranational” in their operation, such as tools, languages, styles of aesthetic expression, and rituals of exchange. Their interdependence and systemic reciprocity are not located within a politically determined boundary. In the descriptive and historical manifestations of “civilization,” it thus names a rough set of conditions, influenced by human action, recognized in many times and places yet lacking an immutable essence. Civilization not only has a material face but a social one as well. This human, institutional character of civilization—embodied in the phrase “civil society”—during the late twentieth century increasingly eclipsed “civilization” in the lexicon of governmental agencies and international bodies.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">World officialdom, in the form of the United Nations and other international organizations, thus avoids the question of whether a “nation” will be a “civilization.” Instead, these organizations ask whether a nation possesses a “civil society.” This shift in terminology avoids the programmatic implications of civilization and its history of colonial violence, yet it alludes to a condition of political stability, urbanity, commerce, and social enrichment. The UN Civil Society Organizations and Participation Programme has viewed the formation of civil society as the goal of political development for states characterized by strongly centralized, authoritarian polities where independent institutions have not been permitted and for unconsolidated societies lacking an institutional sphere. A particular focus has been those states in the developing world emerging from autocratic rule. Since 2000, the Civil Society Programme has expanded its purview considerably to include initiatives related to democratic governance, poverty reduction, crisis prevention and recovery, HIV/AIDS, energy, and the environment. In effect, a global pragmatics of civility—marked by a citizenry’s enjoyment of civil order, a right of association, and venues for expressing public opinion, projecting communal interest, and envisioning the good life—now encompasses the whole realm of social welfare, with the exceptions of civil rights and commerce.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Witnessing the growing semantic amorphousness of the term “civil society,” we can understand why it is difficult to conceive of a clash of civil societies but not difficult to envision clashes between civilizations. “Civilization” retains its denotative character, pointing to communities that possess certain qualities of development and pursuing distinctly formed purposes. These purposes sometimes stand opposed to others. History abounds in such conflicts: Egypt and Babylonia, Greece and Rome, Catholic Spain and Protestant northern Europe. Samuel Huntington—heir to a tradition of inquiry concerned with the “rise and fall” of civilizations extending from Edward Gibbon in the eighteenth century to Oswald Spengler and Toynbee in the twentieth century—theorized these recurring conflicts in his </span><span class="s2"><i>The Clash of Civilizations</i></span><span class="s1"> (1996) but failed to grasp the differences between cultures and civilizations. For a neoconservative, he is unusual in believing that an incommensurability of values exists among cultures. He fails to recognize the pragmatics of global exchange in values and goods now operating even among enemy states.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since 9/11, the robust reemergence of a pre-Collingwood vision of anticivilization force has taken place. A host of commentators—some with popular readerships—conceive of the twenty-first century as a period in which civilization will be beset by external enemies. The nature of these enemies provokes intensive analysis because they do not map onto conventional nation-states or civil societies but operate as adherents to religious or ideological imperatives. These political actors see modern cultures as corrupt and deserving of destruction. Lee Harris’s </span><span class="s2"><i>Civilization and Its Enemies</i></span><span class="s1"> (2004) typifies a literature insistent that enmity to civilization is an authentic threat to the world’s major cultures and that an active defense against these enemies is the responsibility of those states that enjoy the benefits of civility. The articulation of the category “enemy of civilization” provoked a cosmopolitan critique, yet the persistence of terrorism directed at civilian targets over the globe in the years following 9/11 has increased popular credence in the existence of “enemies of civilization,” a credence exploitable by political regimes fixated on the erection of state security mechanisms and technologies of public surveillance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Because the “enemies of civilization” discourse employs a renovated civilization and barbarity dichotomy, it does not conform to Samuel Huntington’s dictum that civilization’s critical function in global political discourse is to explain the deep grammar of conflicts between nation-states. Rather, it now proposes a quality of social existence inimical to barbarity, supplying an extralegal standard for the comportment of nations and movements. Civilization in this case is not utopia but an enriched condition of social existence avowed by those who enjoy it, wished for by those who do not possess it, or reviled by those who view it as pernicious. Civilization thus brings to light inequality.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Efforts to understand the origins of inequality among individuals and social groups can be traced to nineteenth-century thinkers who turned away from the definition of civilization as essence to definitions that took into account practices of social interaction that permitted an enriched quality of communal life: the stability of law, a disinclination to violence, an inclination to cooperation, and an ethic of sociability based on the tolerance of strangers. Arthur de Gobineau, in </span><span class="s2"><i>An Essay on the Inequality of the Races</i></span><span class="s1"> ([1853–55] 1967), gave this analysis a racial cast. Certain biological races were fated to savagery due in part to their intolerance of the other. Gobineau’s linkage of an interactional sociology of civilization with essentialized racism fathered a hybrid picture of civilization of great and pernicious influence. Efforts to purge interactional sociology of essentialist presumptions have been undertaken by Nelson (1973) and Lyman (1990); their “civilization analysis” claims to free social descriptions from essentialist explanations in order to develop a global inquiry that ranges from micro to macro scenes of social action.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of greater power in countering Gobineau’s legacy have been postcolonial studies, whose leading practitioners take care to expose how the descriptive and prescriptive features of the Western discourse of civilization are characteristically intermingled. Civilization always appears in the service of some presumptive project, whether territorial conquest, commercial hegemony, evangelical mission, cultural imperialism, or the enslavement of non-Western populations (Bernal 1995; Paranjape 1998). Most, but not all, postcolonial critics are concerned with strategies for resisting the enchantment of Western civilization. These range from outright rejection to more complex engagements with the legacies of colonial power. Interestingly, some recent postcolonial thinkers embrace a pragmatics of civility and the form of civilization, seeing it as a remedy to tribalism and sectarianism. Leon de Kock (2001), for instance, offers a model of postcoloniality that disavows simple oppositionality by exploring a moment in the history of nascent African nationalism in South Africa when African subject formation was framed in apparent complicity with prescribed forms of Western civility. Similar work on the conceptual homologies between transnationalism, a favored conceptual orientation for American studies and cultural studies, and civilization as now understood by interactionalist sociology would do much to enhance the conversation in the field. Transnationalism and the interactionalist sociology of civilization both explore the pragmatics of cultural permeability on a global scale, pursuing knowledge of those values, practices, institutions, and objects that are shared among states and peoples and that contribute to responsible action among nations and persons.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century United States, the term “community” is used so pervasively that it would appear to be nearly meaningless. The term is often deployed more for its performative effect of being “warmly persuasive” than for any descriptive work it accomplishes (Raymond Williams [1976] 1983, 76). Carrying only positive connotations—a sense of belonging, understanding, caring, cooperation, equality—“community” is deployed to mobilize support not only for a huge variety of causes but also for the speaker using the term. It functions this way for companies such as Starbucks and Target, which have programs and pamphlets in their stores proclaiming their commitment to community, as well as for the feminist scholar who seeks to legitimize her research by saying she works “in the community.” It is deployed across the political spectrum to promote everything from identity-based movements (on behalf of women, gays and lesbians, African Americans, and others), to liberal and neoliberal visions of “civil society,” to movements seeking to restore or reaffirm so-called traditional social values and hierarchies.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The relentless invocation of “community” is all the more remarkable given the persistent critique to which it has been subjected. In the late twentieth century, scholars examined its use in the contexts of identity politics, liberalism, and nationalism, in each case pointing to its disciplinary, exclusionary, racist, sexist, and often violent implications (Joseph 2002). Feminist activists and scholars have argued that the desire for communion, unity, and identity among women tend in practice to make the women’s movement white, bourgeois, and US-centric (Martin and Mohanty 1986). Feminist critics of liberalism have pointed out that the supposedly abstract political community constituted through the liberal state actually universalizes exclusionary gendered and racial norms (Wendy Brown 1995). Critics of European and postcolonial nationalisms have historicized the communal origin stories used to legitimate those nationalisms and emphasized the hierarchies and exclusions likewise legitimated by those narratives. Poststructuralist theories have underwritten many of these critiques, enabling scholars to argue that the presence, identity, purity, and communion connoted by “community” are impossible and even dystopic fantasies (I. Young 1990). In light of these critiques, many scholars have tried to reinvent “community,” to reconceptualize it as a space of difference and exposure to alterity (Mouffe 1992; Agamben 1993). Such stubborn efforts to build a better theory and practice of community only emphasize that the crucial question to pose about “community” as a keyword is this: Why is it so persistent and pervasive?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One answer to this question lies in the realization that many deployments of the term can be understood as instances of a larger discourse that positions “community” as the defining other of capitalist “modernity.” As Raymond Williams ([1976] 1983) notes, “community” has been used since the nineteenth century to contrast immediate, direct, local relationships among individuals with something in common to the more abstract relations connoted by capitalist or modern “society.” While community is often presumed to involve face-to-face relations, capital is taken to be global and faceless. Community concerns boundaries between us and them that are naturalized through reference to place, race, culture, or identity; capital, on the other hand, would seem to denature, crossing all borders and making everything and everyone equivalent. The discourse of community includes a Romantic narrative that places it prior to “society,” locating community in a long-lost past for which we yearn nostalgically from our current fallen state of alienation, bureaucratization, and rationalization. This discourse also contrasts community with modern capitalist society structurally; the foundation of community is supposed to be social values, while capitalist society is based only on economic value. At the same time, community is often understood to be a problematic remnant of the past, standing in the way of modernization and progress.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This narrative of community as destroyed by capitalism and modernity, as supplanted by society, can be found across a wide range of popular and academic texts; one might say that it is one of the structuring narratives of the field of sociology (Bender 1978). And it took on a fresh life in the works of late twentieth-century communitarians such as Robert Bellah (Bellah et al. 1985), Robert Putnam (1993), Amitai Etzioni (1993), E. J. Dionne (1998), and others, all of which are aimed at least in part at nonacademic audiences. These works inevitably misread Alexis de Tocqueville’s </span><span class="s2"><i>Democracy in America</i></span><span class="s1"> ([1835] 2004) as describing a now-lost form of local community that they believe would, if revived, promote democracy and economic prosperity and solve many contemporary problems, including drug use, crime, and poverty.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The discursive opposition of community and society provides a crucial clue to the former’s pervasiveness in contemporary discourse; community is a creature of modernity and capitalism. Williams optimistically suggests that modernity positively constitutes communities of collective action. In </span><span class="s2"><i>The Country and the City</i></span><span class="s1"> (1973, 102, 104), he argues against the nostalgic idealization of pre-enclosure communities that he finds in late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century British literature, pointing out that pre-enclosure villages supported “inequalities of condition” and that “community only became a reality when economic and political rights were fought for and partially gained.” More pessimistically, Nikolas Rose (1999, 172, 174) reads the invocation of community as a central technology of state power, arguing that “community” is used to invoke “emotional relationships” that can then be instrumentalized. He suggests that the communities so invoked are required to take on responsibilities for “order, security, health and productivity” that were formerly carried by the state. And certainly there is substantial evidence for his argument in the proliferation of public-private partnerships, neighborhood watch programs, restorative justice initiatives, and the like, all of which mobilize familial and communal relations to promote subjection to law and order rather than to fight for economic or political rights (Lacey and Zedner 1995; N. Lacey 1996; Joseph 2006).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Community thus can be understood as a necessary supplement to the circulation of state power and capital; as such, it not only enables capital and power to flow, but it also has the potential to displace those flows. Because the circulation of abstract capital depends on the embodiment of capital in particular subjects, the expansion and accumulation of capital requires that capitalists engage in an ongoing process of disrupting, transforming, galvanizing, and constituting new social formations, including communities. Community is performatively constituted in capitalism through processes of production and consumption; through discourses of pluralism, multiculturalism, and diversity; and through niche marketing, niche production, and divisions of labor by race, gender, and nation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This complex relation of community to capitalism is particularly evident in the promotion of nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations (NPOs and NGOs)—“civil society”—in the context of “development” in the United States and internationally. In the United States, nonprofit organizations are said to express community and often stand in for community metonymically. They are the institutional sites where people contribute labor or money to “the community.” And they are posited as the form through which community might be reinvigorated as a complement to capitalism, providing those goods and services that capitalism does not. In the context of “development,” NGOs have been explicitly promoted as a means for developing human and social capital and involving the poor in development projects—as, in other words, sites for constituting liberal capitalist subjects and subjectivities. At the same time, the necessity for such organizations suggests that subjects are not always already capitalist. And in fact, the promotion of NPOs and NGOs has often been explicitly intended to stave off socialism or communism; for example, in the post-Soviet era, “community,” in the guise of NGOs, featured prominently in the promotion of “civil society” in both former communist countries and “developing” countries of the “Third World” (Joseph 2002). The incorporation of subjects as community members at the site of the NGO can be understood as hegemonizing, wedding potentially resistant subjects (potentially or actually communist subjects) to capitalism.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The centrality of community to capitalism becomes more explicit in the context of globalization. Politically diverse iterations of globalization discourse, both popular and academic, argue that capitalism depends on communities, localities, cultures, and kinship to provide the social norms and trust that enable businesses to function and that globalized capitalism is and should be more attuned to particular communities, localities, and cultures (Piore and Sabel 1984; Fukuyama 1995). While a number of scholars have portrayed the localization and culturalization of capitalism as a positive development, creating opportunities for local or communal resistance (Lipietz 1994; Mayer 1994), others have emphasized the weakness, dependence, and vulnerability of the local (Peck and Tickell 1995). The claim that capitalism only recently discovered community is, however, problematic. It suggests that communities, and the economic inequalities among them, have not themselves been constituted by capitalism. On the contrary, the explicit deployment of community within globalization discourse tends to legitimate economic inequalities and exploitation as the expression of authentic cultural difference even as it articulates all communities and cultures as analogous sites for production and consumption (Melissa Wright 1999).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The project of examining what one observer calls “the seductions of community” remains crucial (Creed 2006). Exploring the ways in which community is constituted by or complicit with capital and power can reshape our understandings of the dimensions of our communities and the connections among them. Such exploration might enable us to recuperate and rearticulate the needs and desires for social change that are so often co-opted by the uncritical deployment of the term.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In common usage, the term “conservatism” names a belief that hierarchies constituting the status quo are worth preserving and protecting; that inequality is not a necessary evil but a positive good; and that the defense of individual liberty is the best bulwark against the so-called totalitarian tendencies of an egalitarian politics. One popular variation of this usage posits conservatism as a trans-historical reaction against revolution from below: the emancipation of the lower orders in France; the rebellions of slaves in the Americas; the struggles of the white working class in nineteenth-century United States; and in successive generations, the demands of women, the poor, nonwhite and racialized minorities, and people with marginalized gender identities. In short, conservatism is synonymous with power and the defense of power in ways that are enlivened by violence and war (Robin 2011).</p>
<p>In the first couple of decades of the new millennium, this usage of the term feels consistent with the performance of conservative politics on FOX News and its articulation in publications such as Breitbart. It is also accords well with the “dark money” vision (Mayer, 2016) of the political machinations of the Koch brothers and others judged to be responsible for funding and fueling the Radical Right. And it reflects a belief that conservatism is embroiled in a “deep history” of “stealth planning” to alter the rules of democratic governance in America (MacLean 2017). A key feature of this approach to defining – and exposing – conservatism is the charge that impossibly-wealthy interests promote and then cynically use the resentment of the working-classes, especially the white working-classes, to advance their own agenda. As with the “business conservatism” perspective urged by Kim Phillips-Fein (2010), this definition views conservatism not as a manifestation of the post-WWII “crisis of liberalism,” but as a long, historical process of consolidating political, social and corporate power in the United States while paying lip service to ideas of democracy and individualism.</p>
<p>This dark vision of conservatism, and the politics of the contemporary Republican Party it is said to support, reached a watershed in cultural analysis in Thomas Frank’s <em>What’s The Matter with Kansas? </em>(2004). Frank explored the rise of supposedly grassroots and “anti-elitist” conservatism refracted through his home state of Kansas and the use of cultural wedge issues such as gay marriage, prayer in schools, and misdirected anger toward liberal elites to cement conservative electoral victories. Frank updated the interpretive emphasis on the interconnections among conservatism, power, and resentment with considerable wit. But the general outlines of his argument stretch back at least as far as Richard Hofstadter’s <em>The Paranoid Style in American Politics</em>. Published in the wake of Barry Goldwater winning the presidential nomination over Nelson D. Rockefeller (and the moderate wing of the Republican Party) in 1964, the book describes the Goldwater brand of conservatism as marked by three tendencies: “heated exaggeration,” “suspiciousness,” and “conspiratorial fantasy.” Hofstadter was struck by what was for him the unfathomable unwillingness to sever ties to rightwing extremist organizations such as the John Birch Society. For Hofstadter and others who contributed to the edited volume <em>The New American Right</em> (Bell, 1955), this was at best a “pseudo-conservatism” well outside of the liberal consensus.</p>
<p>Defining conservatism in these ways – through a lens of criticism and suspicion &#8212; means that the term cannot be understood without the preservation of racial hierarchies in and through racist and xenophobic ideologies. But what of those who seek to use the term from a position of affiliation and even affection? Conservatives themselves have mostly rejected the assertion that conservatism is indelibly racist and overly beholden to forms of white nationalism. This tendency manifests in multiple ways: in assertions that slavery and Jim Crow segregation were not racist but an outgrowth of the natural inferiority of Black and other nonwhite peoples – a view updated in the twentieth century in assertions of cultural pathology; in claims that appeals to doctrines such as “state’s rights” have nothing to do with race or civil rights activism and everything to do with critiques of federal power; and in claims that conservatism is in fact “colorblind.”</p>
<p>In one especially provocative series of rhetorical moves, it became common by the 1990s to view conservatism &#8212; and not liberalism &#8212; as responsible for preserving and extending the values of the civil rights movement. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (often labelled a “neoconservative”) describes this turn as “semantic infiltration,” that is, “the appropriation of the language of one’s opponent for the purpose of blurring distinctions and molding it to one’s own political position.” Hence legislation designed to dismantle affirmative-action and other race conscious strategies gets defined as a “civil rights” initiative, and racism is promoted without a direct articulation of race through a “dog whistle” politics (Haney Lopez 2015) – with the metaphor pointing to the ways in which seemingly neutral turns of phrase can confirm a speaker’s support for racist ideologies, though only for those in the audience attuned to those meanings. This compass of ideas reached an apogee in President George Bush’s hesitancy over signing the 1990 Civil Rights Act on the grounds that it was a “quota bill.”</p>
<p>In a less disingenuous vein, some definitions of conservatism have grappled more forthrightly with the degree to which the preservation of a social, political, and moral order structured by hierarchies will inexorably embrace racism and other forms of exclusion and discrimination. Calls to protect the southern “way of life” are indicative of this definitional tendency. In the preface to <em>The Southern Tradition,</em> Eugene Genovese (1994) addresses the race question head-on. “It is one thing to demand – and it must be demanded – that white southerners repudiate white supremacy… It is quite another to demand that they deny the finest and most generous features of southern life” (xiii). What Genovese values most are the communitarian aspects of a southern conservatism rooted in an organic, interdependent vision of the social order. This conservativism regards change as a necessarily slow process and seeks gradual improvement over sudden and therefore dangerous social engineering. It can include a belief that the past is better than the present as well as an emphasis on restoration over revolution. It is often religiously-inflected and informed by assumptions about the “right relations” of parts to the whole as ordained by God. These “right-relations” are, more often than not, unequal and hierarchical. But this is acceptable precisely because inequality is, in this understanding of conservatism, a positive good and an important wellspring of diversity. And it is this understanding of diversity – that we are born different, not equal – that renders egalitarianism at once perilous and impossible.</p>
<p>A century earlier, George Fitzhugh presented this argument in his two classic proslavery texts, <em>South of the South</em> (1854) and <em>Cannibals All</em> (1857). Fitzhugh held that nature makes some men fit to rule and command, and others most suitable to be enslaved and governed. Because of this, it is the duty of the strong to protect and defend the weak. Thus, slavery is understood as a form of protection for slaves unable to be fully self-governing, along with women (“the weaker sex,”) and children. With this argument, Fitzhugh did more than champion slavery in the South. He also denounced the society emerging around industrial capitalism in the North. <em>Cannibals All</em> was an especially sharp critique of the “wage-slavery” in the North, and offered a form of universal (i.e., non-racialized) slavery as a remedy for this “unnatural” form of inequality that unfairly penalizes those who are unfit to compete in a free market society.</p>
<p>In less extreme forms, these ideas can help us to understand usages of the term conservatism that are rooted in ideas about “natural” differences that produce “positive” inequalities. Consider, for instance, the ways of defining conservatism that stress fidelity to traditional gender and sexual norms that rest on binary notions that men and women are fundamentally different. Even when the sexes are viewed as complementary, it is typically clear that men rule and women serve. Books and articles that seek to understand the attraction of social and religious conservatism to women – and that reject easy claims of “false consciousness” – are the most representative of this framework. Kathleen Blee’s (1991) study of women in the KKK was groundbreaking in this regard. It has been followed by studies of women and the post-WWII right (Nickerson 2012), and the cultural logics of free Christian enterprise (Moreton 2009). Cumulatively, they offer a very different style of analysis from that of Frank, rejecting false consciousness as the reason why some people, especially women, embrace conservatism. In these studies, adherents are not being entirely duped by powerful and often unseen forces. They are not being wholly manipulated. They are being inspired.</p>
<p>Some scholarship on conservatism among racial and ethnic minorities has also adopted this more positive framework (Dillard 2001). Similarly, in a study of working-class supporters of Thatcherism in Britain, Stuart Hall argued against any “theory about the world which has to assume that vast numbers of ordinary people, mentally equipped in much the same way as you or I, can simply be thoroughly and systematically duped into misrecognizing entirely where their real interests lie” (1988, 44). More often, however, researchers suggest that the social and religious right have manipulated ideas of gender and sexuality, particularly related to reproductive politics and policy-making. Some of the earliest critical analyses of conservatism and the New Right were written by feminist scholars seeking to understand – and undermine – conservative antifeminism in movements against abortion and the Equal Rights Amendment and for the rights of gays and lesbians (Petchesky, 1981; Luker, 1984; De Hart, 1991). They also explored the larger connections between these highly gendered ideologies and the ways that gender shaped thinking about the proper role of the state, nationalism, economic regulation, and moral “contamination” from communists and other subversives. This is arguably the dominant way that American studies and cultural studies have contended with the ascendency of conservative thought in general – and with the rise of Republican and rightwing women including Anita Bryant, Christina Hoff Sommers, Katie Roiphe, and Phyllis Schlafly. Susan Faludi’s <em>Backlash</em> (1991) is a key popular text in this genre.</p>
<p>Attempts to define conservatism can also draw our attention to Important debates about the meaning of freedom. Put in the starkest terms possible, those who view conservatism in positive ways have tended to define freedom in terms of liberty and individualism – the <em>negative</em> liberty not to be harassed or unduly controlled or limited. Conservatives eventually made an uneasy peace with notions of equality, but only as “equality of opportunity” as opposed to “equality of results” which, they maintain, can breed an egalitarian leveling downward. This libertarian streak can be seen most readily in the 1960 Sharon Statement, the founding document of Young Americans for Freedom. It held that individual freedom is a natural and God-given right; that political freedom is impossible without economic freedom; that limited government and a strict interpretation of the Constitution is essential; that the free market system is preferable over all others; and that Communism must be defeated at all costs. For this brand of conservativism, anticommunism served as the ideological glue that bound together traditionalists and Christian conservatives, advocates of laissez-faire economics and free market idealism, and Cold Warriors dedicated to defeating all vestiges of Communism, at home and abroad. In international relations, this bargain led to support of brutal regimes aligned with the “free world;” domestically, it grafted a fear of subversion at the hands of communists onto an aversion to race mixing, rock-and-roll, gender-bending, sexual liberation, and other “assaults” on traditional morality. The contemporary notion of “culture wars” between the left and the right date from this period (Hartman, 2015).</p>
<p>This usage of conservatism has been vigorously contested by what is, once again, a much darker and more skeptical rendering. One of the most useful – and sweeping – cultural studies critiques of conservative ideologies of freedom is Michael Rogin’s (1987) work on the “countersubversive tradition” of “political demonology” in U.S. political culture. These terms point to the “creation of monsters as a continuing feature of American politics by inflation, stigmatization, and dehumanization of political foes,” Rogin argues, from depictions of “savage Indians” to bomb-throwing anarchists to the Evil Empire, and more recently “Feminazis” and terrorists who allegedly hate our freedom and our way of life (xiii). At every turn, the world is split into good and evil and anything is permissible in the fight against evil. In the end, Rogin argued that the process of demonization allows the “countersubversive, in the name of battling the subversive, to imitate his enemy;” that is, to become terrorist-like and abridge freedom in the heroic fight against terrorism, variously defined (xiii). This powerful cluster of ideas has been informed by the rise of the New Right from the post-WWII era to the ascendency of Ronald Reagan and beyond. And American cultural studies, at least since George Nash (1976), has been puzzling over this fusion of seemingly incompatible and inconsistent ideas ever since (Perlstein, 2001, 2008, 2014; Kintz, 1997; Marable, 1999; Kruse, 2005).</p>
<p>In the early twenty-first century, debates over the proper usage of the term are complicated by the unexpected 2016 electoral victory of Donald Trump, and the degree to which Trumpism has come to define both the Republican Party and the conservative movement. With its stress on tax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans, an overwhelming fidelity to the Second Amendment, and a desire to overturn <em>Roe v Wade</em> by remaking the Supreme Court, Trumpian conservatism is well in line with some past traditions. Yet there are “Never Trump” conservatives and other skeptics within the Republican Party and among Libertarians who judge his strategy to be indecipherable and his message a muddle. Trump’s embrace of reactionary white nationalism, anti-immigration policies augmented by closed borders and barrier walls, authoritarian pretentions, and global isolationism appear far from a direct evolution of a tradition once rooted in small government, fiscal responsibility, and a fear of disorder. A vindictive, mercurial, and erratic standard-bearer ought to be anathema to classical conservatism.</p>
<p>It is true that a retroactive interpretation of U.S. political history might find that Trump’s “America First” nationalism, with its toxic brew of governance by social media and constant insult, connects to some of the most disreputable episodes of the nation’s past. In particular, one can recall the anti-rationalist “know-nothing” politics of a Huey Long or a Joseph McCarthy or even a Sarah Palin, whose vice-presidential candidacy in many ways prefigured Trumpian conservatism. The perilous unpredictability of decisions and situations is why we lack a grand unified theory of conservatism. In the age of Trump, we are presented with protean usages of a term whose future consequences are impossible to predict.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Contract” is at least as old as the Old Testament and as new as the market transactions of the moment—local, national, and global. It encompasses the provinces of religion and commodities, state and civil society, public and private exchange, the rights of persons and the rights to property. Puritan theology speaks of covenants, Enlightenment liberalism of social contracts, political economy of commercial contracts, the law of liberty of contract. Informed by those traditions, US culture has long been infused by contract. Just after the Civil War, a primer handed out by Yankee liberators to former slaves testified to contract’s vast province: “You have all heard a great deal about contracts, have you not since you have been free? . . . Contracts are very numerous; numerous as the leaves on the trees almost; and, in fact, the world could not get on at all without them” (Fisk 1866, 47). The lesson of freedom was not simply that contract was essential but that it was virtually a fact of nature. Never was this more so than in the nineteenth century, when contract prevailed as a metaphor for social relations in free society.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Implicit in the vocabulary of contract is a set of fundamental terms denoting human subjectivity, agency, and social intercourse. As opposed to prescriptive duties or formally coercive bonds of personal dominion and dependence, a contract is, in principle, a purely voluntary obligation undertaken in the expectation of gaining a reciprocal benefit—an equivalent of some sort, a quid pro quo, or, in the language of the law, “consideration.” Thus contract implies both individual volition and mutual exchange, reconciling freedom and obligation, creating rights and duties, and imposing social order through myriad transactions among ostensibly free persons. Above all, contract implies conditions of self-ownership. In order to cede a portion of liberty by choosing to incur duties, contract makers must, in theory, be sovereigns of themselves—possessive individuals, entitled to their own persons, labor, and faculties. A lasting axiom of Enlightenment thought is that contract derives from and governs individual will and that free will is tethered to rights of proprietorship. Early in the nineteenth century, G. W. F. Hegel ([1821] 1979, 58) philosophized that under a contract, a person “ceases to be an owner and yet is and remains one. It is the mediation of the will to give up a property . . . and the will to take up another, i.e. another belonging to someone else.” Or as a US professor of political science explained half a century later, “I cannot make that the property of another </span><span class="s2"><i>by contract</i></span><span class="s1"> which is not </span><span class="s2"><i>mine</i></span><span class="s1"> already” (Woolsey 1878, 74). Equally enduring in this intellectual tradition is the notion that contract’s fundamental properties—self-ownership, consent, and exchange—belonged fundamentally to men. That notion, like the very meaning of “consent,” “exchange,” and “self-ownership,” has provoked a long-standing dispute over the cultural significance of contract.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Notably, a contract is not simply a language, a metaphor, a set of principles, or a worldview. A contract is also a palpable transaction. It is a social relation—an exchange relation—involving what the eighteenth-century British legal theorist Sir William Blackstone ([1765–69] 1979, 118) called the “rights of things” and the “rights of persons.” Abstract principles of entitlement and volition find concrete embodiment in contracts of state, of church, of sale, of debt, of labor, and of marriage. In the realm of US law, the nineteenth century has long been considered the age of contract—with contract figuring as the legal apparatus of classical political economy and laissez-faire liberalism. Yet the authority of contract reached well beyond the law, and contract law itself was heir to older religious and political traditions. In the Middle Ages, contracts of rulership reflected Christian doctrine as well as Roman codes, and ancient, informal customs of covenant shaped the advent of early contract law (Gordley 1991). In the modern era, the roots of contract extend back to understandings of the origins of the state, the Puritan church, and market society in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and, following the paths of the common law, became embedded in debates over the meaning of slavery and emancipation (Hopfyl and Thompson 1979).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since the British settlement of North America, the tenets of self-ownership, consent, and exchange remained central to contract theory and practice, yet the meaning of those tenets was subtly altered to validate changing institutions and social relations. The doctrine of covenant, or contract, lay at the heart of dissenting Protestantism, reconciling divine supremacy and human agency, explaining the relationship between God and humanity as a bargain, and establishing consent as the basis for human obedience to biblical edicts. The Enlightenment theory of the social contract gave secular political formulation to this notion of voluntary submission to the rule of law, thereby legitimating the obedience of citizens to the authority of the state in return for protection of their lives and property. Here, contract entailed volition and reciprocity while also justifying a degree of subordination. But as a paradigm of commercial society, contract came to embody exchange between individuals who were formally equal as well as formally free. It defined the relations of the free market rather than the rules of sovereignty. For Adam Smith ([1776] 1937, 31) and his disciples, contract presupposed “rough equality” among persons involved in commodity exchange. And the antislavery claim of the nineteenth century was that contract represented the absolute antithesis of chattel bondage, with the abstract rights of freedom concretely lodged in the contracts of wage labor and marriage, which entitled ex-slaves to own and sell their labor and to marry and maintain a home.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most famously, contract has been associated in US culture with the career of classical liberalism, an association that past and present critics have deemed the source of contract’s most infamous illusions and contradictions. The criticisms have become canonical and are virtually synonymous with those directed at other core liberal institutions and intellectual traditions: laissez-faire political economy, the negative state, the market calculus of supply and demand, commodity relations, possessive individualism, and the abstractions of rights theory. In contract, so the argument goes, the core liberal tenets of formal equality and freedom cloak actual differences of power, thereby obscuring the underlying social inequalities, dependencies, and informal compulsions that nullify the vaunted rights of individual contract freedom. Since the early nineteenth century, this argument has been advanced by wage workers seeking to form unions and fashion collective work contracts; by ex-slaves resisting free labor’s coercions; by churchmen, reformers, and intellectuals critical of the moral callousness and inequities of the free market; and by statesmen and jurists, such as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, who, in his landmark dissent in the 1905 </span><span class="s2"><i>Lochner v. New York</i></span><span class="s1"> case (198 U.S. 45 (1905)), insisted that the Fourteenth Amendment had been wrongly construed to enshrine liberty of contract as an absolute constitutional right. As one freedman vividly decried the falsity of the contract regime, “I would not sign anything. I said, ‘I might sign to be killed. I believe the white people is trying to fool us’” (Henry Adams, qtd. in Sterling 1976, 6).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another strain of critique has brought to light the contradictions of contract in affirming individual rights while also validating sexual inequality on the basis of putatively immutable physical difference. Thus the “sexual contract” stands alongside the “social contract,” anointing men with property in women, who accordingly are dispossessed of rights to their own persons, labor, sexuality, and property (Pateman 1988). That was the outcry of generations of feminists against the marriage contract, which gave the husband dominion over his wife, binding her to serve and obey him in return for his protection and support. “If the contract be equal, whence come the terms ‘marital power,’ ‘marital rights,’ ‘obedience and restraint,’ ‘dominion and control?’” Elizabeth Cady Stanton protested in 1868. “According to man’s idea, as set forth in his creeds and codes, marriage is a condition of slavery” (Stanton 1868a, 1868b). Subject to the will of a master, the wife had no rights of contract, a fact that led Stanton and others to bitter comparisons between marriage and chattel slavery. Prostitution also figured as an analogy for marriage; reformers argued that both were contracts centered on the sale of sex as a commodity and in which women were not fully free or equal to men. The point was that only in the context of an ideal marriage, contracted freely between husband and wife who were utter equals, could sex be a legitimate token of exchange; otherwise, sex counted as a uniquely inalienable aspect of self (Stanley 1998).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet to highlight only the critical tradition is to lose sight of the emancipatory prospects of contract. Absent such insight, the cultural power of contract ideals becomes inexplicable, even mysterious. For the generation who witnessed the transition from slavery to freedom and argued over the meaning of that transformation, contract offered a way of making sense of the changes in their world and of distinguishing between the relations of freedom and slavery. Contract opened up ways of thinking about the perplexities of a culture that condemned the traffic in slaves while otherwise celebrating the boundlessness of the free market. It did not offer a common vantage point to differently situated persons but instead provided some common principles for expressing differing visions of the genuine meaning of self-ownership, consent, and reciprocal exchange. It was a language of aspiration as well as criticism.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Objections to existing contract relations often translated into demands for universalizing and authenticating the ideals of contract—for more perfectly realizing contract’s promise, as opposed to rejecting it outright. However much ex-slaves disavowed the equation of freedom and the wage contract, they tended to choose willingly to marry, and many expressly invoked their “rights under . . . contract” in challenging the control of ex-masters (Loyd [1865] 1990, 614–15). Notably, however much freedwomen joined with freedmen in affirming the collective dimensions of emancipation, they simultaneously asserted individual rights of property and person and protested the inequalities of marriage. At least some black women, both those born as slaves and those born free, explicitly strove to be self-owning. That was also the vision of generations of white feminists who proclaimed equal rights of contract as a central goal. And however much some critics condemned the entire wage system, many more, through methods ranging from unions and labor legislation to partnerships, cooperatives, and Christian brotherhood, sought to bring greater equality to the wage contract.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Precisely because contract held such emancipatory meaning, its ideals also could mask existing inequalities. That ideological paradox endures along with more palpable contract practices. Today, however, public debate dwells less on the legitimacy of contract than it did a century ago, when the age of contract waned with the advent of the welfare state and the new creeds of liberalism advanced by reformers in the Progressive Era. Then intellectuals and reformers disputed whether industrial capitalism subverted or sustained individual liberty of contract; indeed, many concluded that contract freedom had become illusory. And that conclusion still finds credence among some scholars today, who agree with the famous interpretation put forth by law professor Grant Gilmore in </span><span class="s2"><i>The Death of Contract</i></span><span class="s1"> (1974, 95–96): “The decline and fall of the general theory of contract and, in most quarters, of laissez-faire economics, may be taken as remote reflections of the transition from nineteenth-century individualism to the welfare state and beyond.” But again, the association of contract simply with the ideal world of Adam Smith is too narrow. “Contract” remains a keyword of both US culture and the study of that culture, signifying not only free-market capitalism, consensual government, and the rule of law but also the sovereignty of self that underlies the right of free individuals to choose what to do with their bodies and property. It is not hard to imagine emissaries of the global dispersion of US culture distributing primers just like those put in the hands of freed people after the Civil War.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The word “coolie” is first and foremost a product of European expansion into Asia and the Americas. Of Tamil, Chinese, or other origin, it was popularized by Portuguese sailors and merchants across Asia beginning in the sixteenth century and later adopted by fellow European traders on the high seas and in port cities. By the eighteenth century, “coolie” referred to a laborer of India or China, hired locally or shipped abroad. The word took on a new significance in the nineteenth century, as the beginnings of abolition remade “coolies” into indentured laborers in high demand across the world, particularly in the tropical colonies of the Caribbean. Emerging out of struggles over British emancipation and Cuban slavery in particular, “coolies” and “coolieism”—defined by the late nineteenth century as “the importation of coolies as labourers into foreign countries” (</span><span class="s2"><i>Oxford English Dictionary</i></span><span class="s1">)—came to denote the systematic shipment and employment of Asian laborers on sugar plantations formerly worked by enslaved Africans (Tinker 1974; Irick 1982; Prashad 2001).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The word entered mainstream US culture as a result of these intensifying global debates over slavery, making its first appearance in Noah Webster’s </span><span class="s2"><i>American Dictionary</i></span><span class="s1"> in 1842. Reports on the Caribbean, including the status of “coolies,” circulated widely in the antebellum United States, with antislavery newspapers hailing Asian workers as a “free” alternative to enslaved labor early on. By the outbreak of the Civil War, however, widespread news of violent abuses and rebellions aboard “coolie” ships and on Caribbean plantations generated a powerfully enduring image that would haunt generations of Asian migrants. Represented as a coerced and submissive labor force by anti- and proslavery forces alike, “coolies” came to embody slavery in the age of emancipation. From Hawai‘i to California to Massachusetts, employers of all sorts demanded “coolies,” while white workers and politicians clamored for their exclusion from a “free” America. Well into the twentieth century, US labor leaders such as Samuel Gompers attacked Asian workers as nothing but hordes of “coolies” undermining “American” manhood and wages.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In response, Asian migrants, their liberal allies, and, more recently, Asian Americanist scholars have tried to refute such racist charges by claiming that Asians in the United States were not “coolies.” “Coolies,” they have insisted, were shipped to the Caribbean, while Asians in the United States were immigrants who came voluntarily (Takaki 1989). Given the ubiquity of the word in virtually every discussion on Chinese migrants (and, subsequently, other Asians), these denials have proven neither historically effective nor critically revelatory. It is far more instructive to argue that no one in the United States or the Caribbean was really a “coolie,” a racialized and racializing figure that denied Asian migrants the liberal subjectivity that “immigrants” presumably possessed (Jung 2006).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If we approach the term as a conglomeration of racial imaginings that materialized worldwide in the era of slave emancipation—as a product of the imaginers rather than the imagined—we can begin to see how pivotal “coolies” were in defining racial and national boundaries and hierarchies in the nineteenth century. Racialized as an enslaved labor force in the emergent age of free labor and free trade, “coolies” ultimately reflected the hopes, fears, and contradictions of emancipation. The ambiguous qualities ascribed to “coolies” served to confuse and collapse seemingly indissoluble divides at the heart of race (black and white), class (enslaved and free), and nation (alien and citizen, domestic and foreign) in US culture. Locating, defining, and outlawing “coolies,” at home and abroad, in turn evolved into an endless and indispensable exercise that resolved and reproduced the contradictory aims—racial exclusion and legal inclusion, enslavement and emancipation, parochial nationalism and unbridled imperialism—of a nation deeply rooted in race, slavery, and empire.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Racial fantasies of “coolies” as docile and apolitical made the reality of the Reconstruction amendments (the abolition of slavery, the enfranchisement of black men) and black labor struggles bearable and seemingly surmountable, particularly to white planters in the US South. The mobilization of white workers against dependent “coolies” symbolically restored the racial meanings of whiteness—namely, political and economic independence—when industrial capital’s expansion threatened to kill the Jeffersonian agrarian ideal for good.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The impulse to drive out “coolies” (and prostitutes) from the United States, in large part a cultural legacy of the antislavery movement, justified the earliest legal restrictions on immigration (the Page Law of 1875 and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882). The historical process of excluding “coolies” simultaneously racialized “immigrants”—those worthy of entering the “nation of immigrants”—as white and European in US culture; Asians remained “aliens ineligible to citizenship” until the World War II era. And whether in China, Cuba, or, later, the Philippines, the existence of “coolies”—and the moral imperative to prohibit slavery—fueled and rationalized US imperialism, even as US Americans imported and consumed “un-American” products made by “coolies,” such as sugar from Cuba and Hawai‘i.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Coolie,” then, is a term crucial to understanding the formations of the US nation, state, and empire at a historical moment of great turmoil and promise. Racial imaginings of “coolies” helped remake the United States into a “free,” “white,” and “modern” nation, revealing both its intricate ties to a wider world and its dogged pursuit of an exceptionalist self-image. The violent and mythical legacies of those imaginings have gone a long way toward shaping the United States and the world in the twentieth century and beyond.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Democracy is the name that has been assigned to a dream as well as to certain already existing realities that are lived, by many people, as a nightmare. The dream is of government by the people, government in which the common people hold sway; in which the dispensation of the commons—“the universality of individual needs, capacities, pleasures, productive forces, etc., created through universal exchange” that Karl Marx called wealth—is collectively determined; in which the trace of any enclosure of the commons is an object of the severest vigilance, since such dispensation will have been understood as ending not in tragedy but in romance (Marx [1858] 1993, 488; Hardin 1968). This is the fantasy of democracy as fantasy, as the contrapuntal arrangement of the many voices of the whole. The materialization of this dream will have been real democracy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Authority in democracy can be exercised directly, in the immediate participation of each member of a given polity, or it can be ceded to representatives of the people, mediated not only by an individual person but also by whatever persons, codes, forms, and structures constitute the mode in which a representative is chosen. Every element that intervenes between the commons and authority carries with it a danger for the democracy to come; every idea and procedure that limits or circumscribes common participation is, similarly, a danger. And of the myriad ways in which the democratic dream is deferred and direct participation eclipsed, the most important are those in which the consent of the governed is manufactured by governors and boards of governors in the name of saving already existing democracy. When considering “democracy” as a keyword in culture and cultural studies in the United States, one must come to grips with the severity of the difference between what exists and what is yet to come under the name of democracy while inhabiting a state that constantly announces itself to be democracy’s very incarnation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is partly by way of the shrill ubiquity of such celebratory announcements that we become aware that democracy in the United States has always been in crisis. This fact is indexed by constant contradictory assertions that the United States is democracy’s unique and solitary home and that the nation has the right and duty to export violently what it calls democracy. What it has meant to be a part of the intellectual cohort of the US ruling class, at least in part, is to have participated in the ongoing identification and amelioration of that crisis. The constant crisis of democracy in the United States—something recognized with clarity in the normative national intellectual formation from James Madison to Samuel Huntington, something whose proper management is celebrated every four years, with every presidential inauguration, in what is often reverently and uncritically described as a ritual of continuity, a series of spectacles in which the abortive nature of repetitive beginning is everywhere present, though almost nowhere remarked, </span><span class="s2"><i>as exclusion</i></span><span class="s1">—is precisely that democracy constantly threatens to overflow its limits, to emerge from the shadows in the outlaw form of an excluded, denigrated middle. It is not that which is given but that which invades, as it were, from an alienated inside, from the interior that it has been the business of already existing democracy, throughout the long history of its devolution, to expunge and criminalize (whether in the form of a duplicitous speaking for that middle by the ones who call themselves conservatives or in the forms of abandonment and dismissal, of condescension and mischaracterization, of that middle by the ones who call themselves progressives). Thus US democracy is, on the one hand, what exists now as crisis management and, on the other hand, the acts, dispositions, improvisations, collectivities, and gestures that constitute and will have constituted the crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Noam Chomsky, who has had much to say about what Huntington calls “the crisis of democracy,” is fond of invoking John Dewey as a kind of conceptual antidote to Huntington (Crozier, Huntington, and Watanuki 1975). Early in the last century, Dewey already recognized that “politics is the shadow cast by big business over society” (Chomsky 2005). We could expand on this now by saying that US democratic politics is a mode of crisis management whose most conspicuous and extravagant rituals—elections and the inaugural celebrations and protests that each in its way confirms them—operate at the level of the demonstration. Elections in the United States are meant, finally and above all, to demonstrate that an election took place—a central consideration for structures of authority that depend on the eclipse of democratic content by the ritual reanimation of supposedly democratic forms. We might examine, along with Chomsky and Edward Herman, the history of the US-mandated demonstration election that is a central element of US foreign policy in the “American Century” while emphasizing the fact that such demonstrations were first enacted domestically (Chomsky and Herman 1979). We operate within a long history of the self-nomination of the elect and their restriction of elections and, more importantly because more generally, a long history of antinomian political voicing that, as poet and critic Susan Howe (1993) points out, goes at least as far back as Anne Hutchinson. Straining against pseudodemocratic formality is a question whose utterance defines alternative membership. Where will democracy—which is to say the democracy that is coming—have been found? The answer remains on the outskirts of the American polis.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It remains possible and necessary, then, for anyone who aspires to do cultural studies in the United States to consider and to participate in what Chomsky (2005, 35) calls the “public attitudes that are kept in the shadows.” When one dreams, along with C. L. R. James (1956), of the government of cooks, of the government that cooks or swings in ways that belie facile identifications of the music that cooks and swings with what is called, or what already exists under the name of, American democracy, when one imagines the common and fantastic counterpoint and countertime that moves in perpetual disturbance of the American exception and the imperial acquisitiveness and domestic predation, the ongoing endangering of internal and external aliens, that exception is supposed to justify, then one could be said to move in as well as toward the outskirts and shadows—which are, in fact, the social essence—of the polis. Intimations of this city, which is not on a hill but underground, are given in those occult forms where participation and mediation, participation and representation, interact by way of linkage and articulation rather than eclipse: for instance, in the paramusical, intervallic space where Ray Charles’s voicing and phrasing submits itself to the force of an exteriority that comes, paradoxically, from his own, alien interiority, or in speculative-fiction writer Samuel R. Delany’s paraliterary excursions into the diffuse origins of the city and of writing, where he extends his continuing invocation of what one of Delany’s critics, fellow novelist Joanna Russ, calls “the subjunctivity of science fiction” in order both to illuminate and to inhabit that excess of the mundane that characterizes (the politics of) everyday life in the shadows (Russ 1995; Laura Harris 2005).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Such illumination, such </span><span class="s2"><i>theoria</i></span><span class="s1">, such fantasy, links Delany and Charles, because in both, it is enabled by their placement in the tradition of black radicalism, a tradition of alternative vision predicated on the enabling inability to see (which is to say the capacity and curse of seeing through) the glaring light of already existing democracy and its demonstrations. Something Al Sharpton once said of Charles—that his blindness is the condition of possibility of a rendition of “America the Beautiful” that is at every moment infused with phonographic insight and foresight—helps us understand how Delany’s documentary writing on Times Square is given only through the lens of submerged cities and fragmentary texts of lands that have never, or have not yet, been (Charles 1972; Delany 1994, 2001). Charles and Delany see shades of red and blue that are wholly outside the spectrum of intellectual and pseudointellectual democratic management. Moreover, Sharpton, against the grain of his own obscurantist tendencies, makes clear what must be understood, at least in part, as the Afro-diasporic constitution—and invasion (the incursion of what Cedric Robinson [(1983) 2000] conceptualizes as the eternal internal alien, the </span><span class="s2"><i>metoikos</i></span><span class="s1">)—of a problematic Greek revival, the violently suppressed and nevertheless ongoing work that W. E. B. Du Bois ([1935] 1998) called the “black reconstruction of democracy in America.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Reading and rereading works such as that of Du Bois sharpens our awareness that the United States is the land of formal democratic enclosure and, moreover, the land in which critical analysis of such oxymoronic forms is relegated to the shadows. Such analysis occurs in nonstandard languages and styles; at the same time, whatever democratic energy that remains in the practically empty interior of our democratic forms makes itself manifest as dissatisfaction with those forms. Of course, the irregularity of common cries and common dreams is manifest as both mourning and optimism at the very outset and from the very outskirts of the polis. Recent analyses of the constitutive irruption of the outside (and the outsider) in Athenian democracy bear this out while providing transcendental clues regarding the constant irruptions into the democracy that now exists of the democracy that comes (Loraux 1998; Butler 2000). At the same time, democrats of the outside, the partyless democrats who like to party, who rock the party, recognize that the presence of that future prompts a constant and total mobilization against, moves as if in regulation of, such irruption (Hanchard 2006). Democracy is the rupture of any exclusion, however common that exclusion might appear to be, the recalibration of the polis, of the city, by and according to the most irregular measures. In the United States and in every place subject to US authority, there are multitudes who work to discover it.</span></p>
