				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One might wonder whether any twenty-first-century preoccupation with agrarian values, agrarian ecology, and agrarian ideals comes as too little, too late. Less than 2 percent of the North American public lives in rural areas outside towns, cities, and suburbs, and less than half of the world’s population now lives outside cities. But the New Agrarianism, which is emerging globally, is not restricted to the rural domain, nor is it necessarily a romantic desire to reenact social behaviors and mores associated with rural populaces in bygone eras. Instead, a New Agrarianism is emerging within urban as well as rural communities, and may indeed be the set of values and operating principles that can obliterate the rural-urban divide that, in many ways, characterized and crippled North American and European cultures during the second half of the twentieth century. But what exactly does “agrarian” mean? Why are the concepts associated with it being used once more as rallying cries, decades after most global citizens have become disenfranchised from the land? Finally, why has “agrarian ecology” become a useful focus for anthropologists, biologists, demographers, geographers, historians, and land-tenure lawyers, and why is it being applied to solving problems in at least a dozen countries on four continents?</p>
<p>If we return to its etymological roots, <em>agri-</em> can be traced as far back as the proto-Indo-European noun <em>“h₂é´gros,”</em> meaning field or pasturage, which has cognates not only in Old English but in ancient Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit as well. As used over the centuries in Europe and England, this term refers to a constellation of activities, values, and premises regarding human relationships to cultivated soil or to the land in general. As a prefix in Latin, and then Old, Middle, and modern English, <em>ager-</em> and <em>agri-</em> relates to soil, fields, farms, land, terrain, landscape, territory, and country. In the related term “agriculture,” based on the Latin <em>ager + colere</em>, we see the relationship between humans and the land circumscribed by the activities and values of cultivating, tilling, stewarding, tending, and safeguarding. Agrarian ecology, as articulated by agricultural anthropologist Robert McC. Netting in 1974, is the study of both the social and the legal frameworks that guide tenure to and the human uses of cultural “working” landscapes and the interactions between human communities and their agricultural and ecological resources in the landscapes.</p>
<p>Agrarianism, of late, has come to embody a nuanced set of social, political, and ecological values that see rural activities, behaviors, and ethics as functioning on a higher order than urban- or suburban-derived comparables. However, for well over a century, the phrase “agrarian reform” has had broader recognition in Latin America, Europe, and Asia as a movement to keep peasant societies from becoming increasingly landless and in greater servitude to capitalistic institutions by enacting the redistribution of land and other wealth. Agrarian ecologists have paid particular attention to how peasant societies resist such extractive institutions and organize themselves to protect, sustain, and efficiently use the natural resource base and traditional knowledge upon which their members’ livelihoods depend.</p>
<p>In a very real sense, agrarian values place heightened importance on the daily human commitment to and daily involvement in rural lifeways as God-given responsibilities. Accordingly, Thomas Jefferson is often designated the best early articulator of American agrarian values, while Henry Wise Wood, Louis Bromfield, Ralph Borsodi, Robert Swann, Wendell Berry, Wes Jackson, Helen Nearing, and Will Allen are granted status as the most elegant contemporary North American defenders of agrarian values in the face of agricultural industrialization and ex-urban growth. However, agrarian values are not exclusively Euro-American or even Christian, for Marxist materialists around the world have come to embrace some of the same principles and strategies for valuing the work done by peasant farmers. As eloquent as Jefferson and Berry in the United States and European voices such as Jean Giono and John Berger may be, Japanese farmer Masanobu Fukouoka and Australian permaculturist Bill Mollison exemplify the power and reach of agrarian values outside of the Euro-American geographic and cultural context.</p>
<p>Because twentieth-century agrarian proponents such as Canadian Henry Wise Wood, Japanese Masanobu Fukuoka, and American Wendell Berry have often been diagnosed by urban critics as being afflicted with a nostalgia-emitting dysfunction that has symptoms of being “anti-urban,” “luddite,” or “retro,” some proponents such as Eric Freyfogle and David Walbert call their philosophies “Neo-Agrarian.” On his populist website, newagrarian.com, Walbert offers a brilliant articulation of how the New Agrarianism can be distinguished from other forms of agrarianism that may be flawed by romanticism or nostalgia. He argues that New Agrarianism is defined by four elements. First, while it draws heavily on past agrarian practices and thinking, it is not bound by them because New Agrarianism is focused on building the future. Second, New Agrarianism is concerned with creating a new kind of rural community for the twenty-first century—one that is tied neither to traditional models of rural America nor to the dominant large-scale industrial agricultural approach. Third, New Agrarianism views sustainable community as the ultimate goal, and sustainable agriculture is just one critical part of that vision. Thus, New Agrarian values can be expressed in all sectors of the economy and across all aspects of a sustainable culture and life. Fourth and finally, New Agrarianism recognizes that society is mostly urban and sees this as an opportunity to seed New Agrarian values within and across nations and urban areas, since the core of this philosophy is the desire for sustainable connections among nature, place, and community.</p>
<p>And yet, David Walbert, David Orr, Will Allen, and others concur that an agrarian believes in, if not the primacy, then at least the uniqueness of agriculture among human endeavors. Activists David Hanson and Edwin Marty, coauthors of <em>Breaking through Concrete: Building an Urban Farm Revival</em>, believe that agrarian values and practices should and can be expressed in urban, suburban, and ex-urban settings as well as in rural landscapes. Youth groups such as FarmFolk/CityFolk, the National Young Farmer’s Coalition, and Greenhorns are moving such an agenda forward as a social movement that now crosses international boundaries. In their view, a foodscape is no longer (and has actually never been) a place beyond the city’s limits, and the quest for just, equitable, and sustainable food systems and environmentally healthy foodsheds must engage both rural and urban dwellers of all races, classes, and languages with equal strength. The fact that over twenty-five hundred acres of Metro Detroit’s sixty-five hundred acres of formerly built-upon and abandoned urban lots are once again producing food is testament to the survival of agrarian values in an urban setting.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth noting that agrarian and neo-agrarian advocates link themselves to an unbroken chain of prophetic voices that have critiqued excessively urban, inward-looking, and narcissistic values of those who have become indifferent to the plight of farmers, fishers, ranchers, and foragers, and to the land itself. In theologian Ellen Davis’s finely researched book, <em>Scripture, Culture, and Agriculture: An Agrarian Reading of the Bible</em>, it becomes historically clear that agrarian voices have risen up as prophets, dissidents, and agents of change whenever urban hierarchical or industrial societies have become too excessive in their consumption, waste, and hegemony over others. Davis deftly links the messages and methods of the Old Testament prophets with modern-day agrarian voices from many countries.</p>
<p>On the academic or scholarly level, it is surprising that biologically trained ecologists are among the least engaged in the documentation and application of agrarian ecology (<em>sensu</em> Netting) compared to geographers, anthropologists, agro-ecologists, and rural sociologists. There are, of course, exceptions among broad-based natural scientists such as Mexican Victor Toledo, Chilean Miguel Altieri, and Indian Vandana Shiva, who have trained hundreds of students to apply a broader perspective to ecological issues in food-producing landscapes. Anyone who still believes that agrarianism is something of the past should spend a day with “greenhorns,” some of whom are now associated with Via Campesina, Slow Food International, or various young farmers’ coalitions and permaculture guilds. Be assured that you will be both tired and fulfilled at the end of one long but fruitful day with them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="pf">One English word, one Western concept—“animal”—somehow encompasses a vast array of creatures—sponges, spiders, capybara, camels, eels, eagles, ticks, tigers, octopi, orangutans, dinosaurs, and slugs—but it rarely contains humans. Western philosophy and everyday conceptual frameworks define the human against the animal, forcing the multitude of beings other than <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;">Homo sapiens</span></span></em> into one category. Jacques Derrida notes the absurdity and violence of this ostensibly neutral term:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="bqs">Whenever “one” says “The Animal,” each time a philosopher, or anyone else, says “The Animal” in the singular and without further ado, claiming thus to designate every living thing that is held not to be human (man as rational animal, man as political animal, speaking animal, <span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">zōon logon echon</span></span></span>, man who says “I” and takes himself to be the subject of a statement that he proffers on the subject of the said animal, etc.), well, each time the subject of that statement, this “one,” this “I” does that he utters an <span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">asininit<span style="border: none;">y</span></span></span></span> [<span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">bêtise</span></span></span>]. (Derrida 2008, 31)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="pf">Uttering the term “animal,” in the singular, he argues, is a disavowal that demonstrates one’s “complicit, continued, and organized involvement in a veritable war of the species” (Derrida 2008, 31).</p>
<p class="p">“Animal” is an overwrought, overloaded term indeed. The category has been invoked to elevate humans above all other living creatures as well as to denigrate certain groups of people as not-quite-human via racist, sexist, classist, Social Darwinist, and colonialist ideologies that place them “closer” to animals in hierarchies of being. Human exceptionalism, emerging from monotheisms, Enlightenment humanism, capitalist anthropocentrism, and other forces insulates (some) humans from kinship with degraded, brutish beasts. But repressed critters return to bite. Monster movies such as <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">The Island of Dr. Moreau</span></span></span></em> feature human/animal hybrids that rouse the viewers’ recognition of the animality of the human only to conclude by assuring us that we are certainly not animals after all (Alaimo 2001). Evolution says otherwise. Charles Darwin, who could be considered the first “posthumanist” philosopher, remarked upon the rather obvious correspondences between humans and other animals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="bqs">It is notorious that man is constructed on the same general type or model as other mammals. All the bones in his skeleton can be compared with corresponding bones in a monkey, bat, or seal. So it is with his muscles, nerves, blood-vessels and internal viscera. The brain, the most important of all the organs, follows the same law. (<span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Descent of Man</span></span></span>, 1936, 395–96)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="pcon">The word “notorious” unveils the paradox that the fact that “man” is constructed like other mammals is somehow both accepted and unacceptable, both obvious and objectionable. Darwin attempts to make human kinship with other animals more appealing by telling many a charming and humorous tale demonstrating how the animals that humans would denigrate as such actually possess various “human” characteristics, of curiosity, reason, language, affection, tool use, and even religious experiences.</p>
<p class="p">Marc Bekoff’s recent work continues this tradition, documenting how various animals think, feel, play, and even behave “morally” (2007; Bekoff and Pierce 2009). These capabilities, Bekoff and many others insist, demonstrate that living beings other than humans deserve ethical consideration. Joy Williams’s wry term “animal people” (which is also the title of her scathing essay), denotes humans who advocate on behalf of nonhuman life, but it also suggests that these people are themselves, unflinchingly, “animals” (Williams 2002). Boundary creatures, such as primates, cyborgs, the oncomouse, and dogs populate Donna Haraway’s corpus, troubling commonsensical conceptual divisions and definitions that would distance humans from other life forms. One of her most compelling arguments, however, is that what humans are as a species is partly due to canines. In <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">The Companion Species Manifesto</span></span></span></em> she argues that humans and dogs do not exist as separate entities but, instead, have co-constituted each other through their significant relations across evolutionary time. “Dogs are about the inescapable, contradictory story of relationships—co-constitutive relationships in which none of the partners pre-exist the relating, and the relating is never done once and for all. Historical specificity and contingent mutability rule all the way down, into nature and culture, into naturecultures” (Haraway 2003, 12). The conceptual abyss between “human” and “animal” that Derrida encounters becomes, in Haraway’s work, a fleshy realm of interconnected histories, significant relations within specific “naturecultures.”</p>
<p class="p">Whereas Haraway’s boundary creatures radically muddle the human/animal divide, strategic boundaries have been drawn at other sites. The Great Ape Project, for example, defends “the rights of the non-human great primates—chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and bonobos, our closest relatives in the animal kingdom” (Great Ape Project). While the appeal for the great apes stresses their kinship with humans, the “Declaration of Rights for Cetaceans: Whales and Dolphins” asserts the “equal treatment of all persons,” basing personhood on “scientific research [that] gives us deeper insights into the complexities of cetacean minds, societies and cultures.” The list of ten rights includes the right to life, freedom from captivity or servitude, the “right to protection of their natural environment,” and “the right not to be subject to the disruption of their cultures” (Helsinki Group 2010). Both the Great Ape Project and the “Declaration of Rights for Cetaceans” release particular species from the “asininity” of “the animal,” insisting that certain animals demand separate ethical and legal consideration. Yet, even for those of us who passionately believe in granting the great apes and the cetaceans all the rights outlined in these declarations, these movements do, of course, beg the question of what other living beings should be granted rights and whether the rights framework is adequate or appropriate for addressing the many assaults on the lives and well-being of a multitude of living creatures. Cary Wolfe, commenting on the “Spanish Parliament’s approved resolution to grant basic rights to great apes,” argues that</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="bqs">even as it constitutes a monumental step forward for our relations with non-human animals within the political purview of liberal democracy and its legal framework, it might well be seen, within the biopolitical context opened up by Esposito and others, as essentially a kind of tokenism in which non-humans “racially” similar enough to us to achieve recognition are protected, while all around us a Holocaust against our other fellow creatures rages on and indeed accelerates. (Wolfe 2010, 8, 23)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p">The declaration of the rights of “higher animals” reveals the fault line between animal-oriented philosophies and movements and environmental philosophies and movements. Most notably, biocentrism reverses the established hierarchy of living creatures, asserting that life on Earth could continue without humans, great apes, or cetaceans, but not without bacteria, which are crucial for ecosystems. Animal rights, animal welfare, and animal ethics tend to depart from environmentalism’s focus on large-scale, interdependent systems, such as ecosystems and habitats, for example, as well as the threats to those systems—pollution, habitat loss, climate change, overfishing, extinction—as they focus on particular animals. But climate change alone, which threatens to push a million species into extinction by 2050, illustrates why attention to large-scale, interconnected systems is crucial for the continued existence of nonhuman creatures. Conversely, environmental activists, organizations, and scholars rarely consider cruelty to factory-farmed animals, animals used for experiments, or animals exploited for the entertainment of humans. Appeals to wilderness, wildness, conservation, aesthetics, and biodiversity are cordoned off in another discursive universe, far from sterile laboratory cages or filthy feed lots.</p>
<p class="p">While environmentalists examine interconnected systems, “animal people” shift the focus from “objective” views of the big picture to “subjective” standpoints of other living creatures. Scientists, writers, philosophers, and artists have taken on the formidable task of attempting to understand particular animals’ worlds and perspectives, from Jacob von Uexküll’s <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans</span></span></span></em> (1934 [2010]) to Anna Sewell’s <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Black Beauty</span></span></span></em> (1877)<span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">,</span></span></span> Thomas Nagel’s “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?” (1974), artist Sam Easterson’s videos from animal perspectives (2001), Les Murray’s poems in <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Translations from the Natural World</span></span></span></em> (1992), and the most provocative and perhaps problematic portrayal of elephant culture, kinship, mythology, and even religion: Barbara Gowdy’s novel <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">The White Bone</span></span></span></em> (2000). Notwithstanding the irresolvable epistemological difficulties with attempting to understand the lives, cultures, and ways of being of other creatures, the scientific, philosophical, literary, and artistic endeavors can spark ethical and political engagements. Despite Joy Williams’s justified lament, “We learn more about them, and that does not save them,” animal people still somehow hope that such findings will translate into less animal suffering (Williams 2002, 122). Whereas Williams bemoans the fact that the production of knowledge about animals does not diminish cruel and exploitative practices, as the exclusively human, monolithic “we” amasses information<em> <span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">about</span></span></span></em> animals that rarely translates into movements <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">for</span></span></span></em> animals, Bruno Latour proposes a political “collective” that would include the “voices of nonhumans” (2004a, 69) as represented by scientists, with their instruments and their “capacity to record and listen to the swarming of different imperceptible propositions that demand to be taken into account” (2004a, 138). Although Latour does not grant them an official role in his collective, philosophers, transdisciplinary animal studies scholars, writers, filmmakers, and artists seek to shift beliefs, attitudes, and practices toward nonhuman species. Attention to nonhuman creatures within academic disciplines is resulting in new areas, such as “multispecies ethnography” (see Deborah Bird Rose’s essay in this collection). Whether or not such investigations will benefit diverse living creatures remains to be seen.</p>
<p class="p">Insisting upon the perceptual, cognitive, semiotic, phenomenological, and cultural differences of different species is invaluable for understanding the vast world of living creatures as more than Cartesian machines. But new materialist approaches, which turn their attention to corporeality, substances, and physical agencies, suggest that animals need to be considered within material systems—not only within ecosystems and habitats but also within food systems, big pharma, chemical industries, and other areas of global capitalism. Nicole Shukin’s brilliant book <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Animal Capital: Rendering Life in Biopolitical Times</span></span></span></em> urges us to regard animal bodies, as “capital becomes animal, and animals become capital” in a “semiotic and material closed loop, such that the meaning and matter of the one feeds seamlessly back into the meaning and matter of another” (Shukin 2009, 16). Her conception of “rendering” signifies both “the mimetic act of making a copy” and “the industrial boiling down and recycling of animal remains” (Shukin 2009, 20). Drawing on Shukin’s formulation allows for consideration of another, disturbing sort of “rendering”—of beings boiled down to data—which begs the question of environmentalism’s complicity in animal suffering. In short, to what extent do various environmental arguments, movements, and policy decisions rely upon scientific data on toxicity or radiation that has been produced through laboratory testing on mice, rats, rabbits, and other animals?</p>
<p class="p">New materialisms may interconnect environmental and animal advocacy. In <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Bodily Natures: Science, Environment, and the Material Self</span></span></span></em>, I argue for a conception of transcorporeality that traces the material interchanges across human bodies, animal bodies, and environments. BlueVoice.org, for example, a marine conservation organization that focuses on dolphins and whales, epitomizes a transcorporeal environmental politics by stressing that humans, dolphins, and whales are all vulnerable to the harmful effects of mercury and organochlorines. In the short film entitled <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">A Shared Fate</span></span></span></em>, Hardy Jones, a founder of BlueVoice.org, explains how he had dedicated his life to studying and protecting cetaceans. Ironically, his “extraordinary bond” with dolphins becomes undeniably corporeal when he discovers that, like many of the dolphins he studies, he has developed chronic mercury poisoning and multiple myoma, caused by eating the same fish the dolphins eat. Sadly, <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">A Shared Fate</span></span></span></em> does not seem to include the fish within its horizons of concern, as it focuses on “higher” creatures. Nonetheless, it does dramatize how human activities produce substances that invade marine ecosystems. Such things as coal-burning power plants, pesticides, and flame retardants result in an ocean riddled with mercury and organochlorides, which threaten marine life. As with most transcorporeal recognitions in risk society, <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">A Shared Fate</span></span></span></em> displays both the necessity for scientifically derived data and the need for embedded epistemologies that reconfigure the boundaries between scientific practices, politics, human health, nonhuman animal health, and environmentalism. Even such an anthropocentric concept as Ulrich Beck’s “risk society,” which stresses the scientific mediation of knowledge, can descend to the bottom of the sea, where benthic worms, sea cucumbers, and krill ingest “toxin-laden microplastics” (Kaiser 2010, 1506). Not unlike ordinary humans navigating the bewildering risks we cannot properly assess, the benthic creatures can no longer rely upon their own sensory organs to detect danger. Animal studies and environmental studies could be enriched by interconnecting investigations of specific animals’ modes of being and knowing with theories and data pertaining to ecological systems, risk, and material interactivity. As new materialisms—some of which demonstrate little concern for either nonhuman animals or the environment—develop, it will be crucial to consider the promises and perils of theoretical terminology that supplants the term “animal.” “Nonhumans,” “things,” and “objects” purport to encompass “the animal,” but these terms sometimes ontologically and ethically flatten the world in such a way that “plumbers, cotton, bonobos, and DVD players” exist “equally” (Bogost 2009, n.p.). Animal people and environmentalists will need to assess whether such theoretical formulations offer suitable conceptual habitats for diverse living species.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="pf">The world today is undergoing rapid environmental change, driven by human population growth and economic development. This change encompasses such diverse phenomena as the clearing of rainforests for agriculture, the eutrophication of lakes and shallow seas by fertilizer run-off, depletion of fish stocks, acid rain, and global warming. These changes are cause for concern—or alarm—among some, and are regrettable if unavoidable side effects of economic growth for others.</p>
<p class="p">How significant are these changes in total? How might they evolve, and what might their ultimate consequences be? One way of studying these changes is to consider them as the latest phase of the many environmental changes that have affected the Earth since its origin, a little over four and a half billion years ago. Humans may be considered as geological agents, and anthropogenic environmental change may be compared with events in Earth’s deep history.</p>
<p class="p">Such analysis dates, perhaps surprisingly, from the earliest days of organized geological study. Working before the French Revolution, the Comte de Buffon wrote arguably the first evidence-based geological history of the world—<em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Les Époques de la Nature</span></span></span></em>, published in 1788 (Roger 1962): his seventh and final epoch denoted the time during which humans dominated and warmed (beneficially, Buffon thought) the Earth. (While Buffon’s theories of racial environmentalism have largely been dismissed, his thoughts on geological time and process remain important to contemporary discussions of the Anthropocene.) Later, works by scholars such as George Perkins Marsh (1864) and Antonio Stoppani (1873—he proposed the term “Anthropozoic”) noted the growing impact of humans on Earth, with the likes of Vladimir Vernadsky (1945) and Robert Sherlock (1922) then developing various aspects of this concept.</p>
<p class="p">Throughout the twentieth century, most geologists (e.g., Berry 1925) dismissed human impact as insignificant when set against the broad canvas of Earth history. This was the case partly because of the time scale. The ten-thousand-year span of human civilization is barely significant on the scale of geological time, while the phase of industrialization is far shorter still. Furthermore, the great natural forces of the Earth—mountain building, volcanic outbursts, meteorite impacts, and so on—were regarded as of far greater long-term significance than the brief human alteration of an ephemeral landscape.</p>
<p class="p">This changed when Paul Crutzen (Crutzen &amp; Stoermer 2000; Crutzen 2002) proposed that we were now living in the Anthropocene, because of the scale of the human-driven chemical, physical, and biological changes to the Earth’s atmosphere, land surface, and oceans. The “Anthropocene” (an “Anthrocene” had also been proposed a little earlier by Revkin 1992) caught on, and began to be used almost immediately by a wide range of scientists and made an impact among the general public.</p>
<p class="p">Why the change in opinion? First, it was becoming clear that while human impacts may be geologically brief, they are not trivial. Some “invisible” effects—such as increases in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere—can lead to profound physiographic effects by their influence upon global temperature and therefore (through the melting of ice) on sea level. Second, the term was found useful as a means of integrating and conveying the different types of global change. Third—and particularly as regards public impact—the word itself is evocative, overtly placing humans within the same geological narrative (one of almost infinite duration!) that the dinosaurs once occupied.</p>
<p class="p">Where is the concept at present? As an informal term, it now seems firmly established in the sciences—and in the arts too. It has been the focus of studies published by the Royal Society (Williams et al. 2011), of a major initiative of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP: http://www.igbp.net/), and of a major modern art exhibition at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin in 2013–14. The use of this term to denote the current time interval seems set to continue, and probably spread.</p>
<p class="p">Given this widespread use in practice, the Anthropocene is being formally considered as a possible addition to the Geological Time Scale by an Anthropocene Working Group of the Internal Commission on Stratigraphy (http://www.quaternary.stratigraphy.org.uk/workinggroups/anthropocene/). It may, therefore, join “Jurassic,” “Pleistocene,” and other terms that underpin the science of geology (Zalasiewicz et al. 2010). This process will involve much detailed analysis over the coming years, and formalization is not assured. The term has to be shown to be not only technically valid but also of practical value (rather than a hindrance) to working Earth scientists.</p>
<p class="p">One benefit of formalization would be precise definition, for currently there is no accepted date for the beginning of the Anthropocene. It is mostly used in Paul Crutzen’s (2002) meaning, as dating from the Industrial Revolution, at around 1800 CE. However, in geology, a geological time boundary must be both synchronous (by definition) and also effectively recognizable in strata. In the case of the Anthropocene, these strata include artificial deposits produced as a consequence of urban development and mineral extraction (Price et al. in Williams et al. 2011; Ford et al. in Waters et al. 2014), damming of rivers, deforestation, and coastal reclamation (Syvitski and Kettner in Williams et al. 2011) and also deposits lacking discernable human influence—those of remote desert dunes, for instance. The “human-made strata” locally date from before the Industrial Revolution, and in general are strongly diachronous (i.e., formed at different times in different places), reflecting the spread of human civilizations around the globe over several millennia.</p>
<p class="p">One potential boundary that is both widely detectable in sediments and approximately synchronous is the spread of radionuclides from atmospheric nuclear weapons tests (Zalasiewicz et al. 2014; Zalasiewicz et al. 2015; Waters et al. 2015) and of fixed nitrogen from fertilizer manufacture (Holtgrieve et al. 2011), both of which date from ca. 950 CE. This date broadly coincides with “The Great Acceleration” (see Steffen et al. in Williams et al. 2011), during which the use of natural resources and the emission of pollutants increased rapidly. The pros and cons of various boundary candidates need to be considered prior to any decision on formalization.</p>
<p class="p">Formally, there is the question, too, of the hierarchical level of the Anthropocene, for the geological time scale consists of smaller units nested within larger ones. Thus, currently (formally), we are living within the Holocene Epoch, which is a part of the Quaternary Period (which began 2.58 million years ago, when the Earth became glaciated at both poles), which lies within the Cenozoic Era (which began at the mass extinction event sixty-six million years ago, when the dinosaurs and much else became extinct), which in turn is part of the Phanerozoic Eon (which began over a half-billion years ago, with the sudden and widespread appearance of complex animal behavior in the fossil record, represented by the burrowing traces of those organisms).</p>
<p class="p">Currently, the Anthropocene is being considered as an epoch (Zalasiewicz et al. 2015). If that is accepted, then the Holocene has formally terminated (though the Quaternary, Cenozoic, and Phanerozoic would continue). There are other possibilities, such as a period on one hand and an age (a subdivision of an epoch) on another. The hierarchical level ultimately chosen should, at least in part, reflect the scale of environmental change (which will in turn determine the distinctiveness of future geological strata). How does the Anthropocene currently seem to be measuring up?</p>
<p class="p">The answer is not straightforward, as the component phenomena of the Anthropocene are evolving rapidly and, for the most part, are in their early stages. Future (imperfectly predictable) trends will develop over many millennia at least.</p>
<p class="p">Geological changes so far include some that are entirely novel in Earth history. Most distinctive are the “urban strata,” which may be thought to approximate to (eminently fossilizable) gigantic trace fossil systems currently spreading across and beneath terrestrial surfaces (Zalasiewicz et al. 2014; Zalasiewicz, Waters, and Williams 2014). Of chemical changes to the environment, the human-driven influx of carbon from rock strata into the atmosphere is (as yet) smaller in scale than geologically ancient, natural outbursts such as that of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, some fifty-five million years ago; but, it has taken place more rapidly—over a couple of centuries rather than over several millennia (Ridgwell and Schmidt 2010). That ancient event led to warming of some 5–8° C globally (a process that is now in its early stages) and significant sea level rise (something that, currently, has barely begun).</p>
<p class="p">Ultimately, the most important changes are those to the biosphere, the sum of which are now colossal (Williams et al. 2015). These changes are complex, having begun on the land before affecting the sea. They include species extinctions, though the scale does not yet approach the “big five” mass extinctions of the past five hundred million years. But, with many species now critically endangered, “business-as-usual” will probably see a comparable mass extinction within a few centuries (Barnosky et al. 2011). A related biological change is already on a scale without precedent in Earth history: the species translocated across the globe by humans, consciously or unwittingly. These mass species invasions have led to the proposal of a “Homogenocene” (Samways 1999). Any such biological change has permanent effects, as it determines the course of future evolution. In this sense, the course of Earth history has already been reset.</p>
<p class="p">The Anthropocene is hence multifactorial (and the factors naturally interrelate, for instance as climate warming drives further biological change), complex, evolving, and in its early stages. What does it mean more widely for society? First, it provides an integrated overview of climate change, related to such concepts as planetary boundaries—the limits that should not be exceeded to ensure a functional Earth system. It may be criticized for undermining efforts at conservation (Caro et al. 2011), or invoked to accept (and take responsibility for) human planetary domination (Ellis, Antill, and Kreft 2012). Even its formalization may have significance beyond geological nomenclature, being significant to international environmental law (Vidas, in Williams et al. 2011). Its evolution, as a concept and as observed geological reality, will encompass the future of this planet and of its inhabitants.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="pf">Biomimicry is a relatively new design methodology that studies nature’s best ideas, abstracts its deep design principles, and then imitates these designs and processes to solve human problems. The term “biomimicry” comes from the Greek words “<em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;">bios</span></span></em>,” meaning “life,” and “<em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;">mimesis</span></span></em>,” meaning “to imitate.” Related to yet also different from terms in earlier use, such as “bionics” and “biomimetics,” biomimicry—an approach popularized by Janine Benyus in her 1997 book <span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><em>Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature</em>—</span></span>entails the “conscious emulation of life’s genius” (Benyus 1997), utilizing design strategies that have been fine-tuned through 3.8 billion years of evolution. Whether in the areas of energy, material manufacture, recycling, chemistry, engineering, transportation, or computing, other organisms have managed to do many of the things humans want to do, without depleting fossil fuels, polluting the planet, or mortgaging their future.</p>
<p class="p">The concept of looking to nature for design ideas is not new. Humans have been observing and imitating processes in nature for thousands of years (Merchant 1980). Leonardo da Vinci, the Wright brothers, and Buckminster Fuller, for example, are well known for their observations and innovations inspired by nature, as are many indigenous peoples. The practice of intentionally emulating nature’s forms and processes to create more sustainable technologies, however—the principle aim of biomimicry—is a comparatively recent phenomenon.</p>
<p class="p">Innovators in a variety of fields are using biomimicry to develop new technologies to solve a range of human challenges, from health care and water purification to pollution and clean energy to architecture and automation (Lakhtakia and Martín-Palma 2013; Passino 2005; Pawlyn 2011). Inspired by nature’s logarithmic spiral, for example, fluid dynamics design firms are engineering fans and propellers that use 30–70 percent less energy. Vaccines that no longer need to be refrigerated because they contain new preservatives that mimic organisms in nature that can survive in a dormant state for decades are now reaching more isolated populations. Colors created from material structure, modeled after the physical manipulations of light that produce the vibrant blue of a Morpho butterfly or the brilliant hues of a peacock feather are replacing harmful pigments in textiles and paints. Nontoxic, waterproof adhesives inspired by the “glue” of Blue mussels are revolutionizing wood composites by eliminating the off-gassing of volatile organic compounds in new buildings. Around the world, the number of biomimicry papers, patents, and products is growing rapidly (Bonser and Vincent 2007; AskNature.org).</p>
<p class="p">Biomimicry requires its practitioners to look beyond the mere imitation of a single function, such as the form or shape of an organism, to the sustainability models provided by more complex natural systems. Where many sustainability frameworks use political or consensus-driven parameters, biomimicry uses ecology to determine appropriate place-based standards. Energy parameters for the design of a building in a desert climate, for example, would be modeled from organisms found in that specific habitat and would thus be quite different from those in an arctic environment. The Eastgate Center in Harare, Zimbabwe, which mimics the intricate ventilation tunnels of termite mounds to reduce energy costs, is perhaps the best-known contemporary example of such modeling (Grant 2012). Biomimicry can work at even larger scales as well. The international architecture and engineering firm HOK has incorporated the principles of biomimicry into the master plan for the development of the new hill city, Lavasa, in the Mose Valley near Pune, India. By studying and measuring the behavior of local plants and animals, such as the deflection of rainwater by tree canopies, or the mound-building techniques of harvester ants, and then using these observations to shape the city’s design, HOK is aiming not only to integrate the project with local ecosystems but also to develop sustainable, site-specific “ecological performance standards” (Peters 2011).</p>
<p class="p">While biomimetic ideas and approaches have gained broad acceptance, they have not done so without critique. Some question whether biomimicry relies too uncritically on a belief in nature as a perfect system rather than an occasionally flawed one, and on a concept of “nature” that is entirely separate from human culture, rather than seeing the natural and the human as already interdependent systems (Armstrong 2013). Although some theorists promote a biomimicry that operates “in the service of a bio-inclusive ethic,” others have proposed biomimetic designs that in theory could replace rather than enhance the environments they mimic, giving biomimicry an ethical ambiguity that some environmental philosophers say remains to be resolved (Mathews 2011). Like all energy-saving “green” methodologies, biomimicry may also be subject to the Jevons Paradox, in which savings in production or consumption are often accompanied by overall increased energy usage (given the growth imperative in market economies), potentially negating any ecological improvements unless the broader political, economic, and cultural contexts in which they are applied are also challenged (Alcott 2005). Despite these critiques, it is the hope of practitioners like Benyus that truly sustainable biomimicry will usher in “an era based not on what we can <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">extract</span></span></span></em> from nature, but what we can <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">learn</span></span></span></em> from [it]” (Benyus 1997).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="pf">The term “biopolitics” has four distinct but overlapping meanings in modern scholarship. According to Lemke’s history of the term (Lemke 2011), political scientists used “biopolitics” in a variety of ways as early as the 1920s, and the Third Reich used it to describe their eugenic plans. But the term really found common usage first among 1960s political scientists interested in the relationship of evolutionary biology and politics (Caldwell 1964). Forming the Association for Politics and the Life Sciences (APLS) in 1981, they defined “biopolitics” as any investigation of the effect of biology on politics, from the primate origins of hierarchy to infectious disease impacts on warfare to the influence of the health of leaders on their decision making (Somit and Peterson 1998).</p>
<p class="p">Biopolitics scholars argued against the prevailing social science model that human beings were a tabula rasa shaped by socialization. During the fights over sociobiology (Wilson 1975) in the 1970s and 1980s, biopolitics scholars were suspected of biological determinism and attempts to condone sexism, racism, and other social problems (Lewontin, Rose, and Kamin 1984; Segerstråle 2001). Thirty years later, the emergence of evolutionary psychology and social neuroscience has validated and depoliticized this form of biopolitical investigation, which has been used in political arguments by both the Left (Singer 2000) and the Right (Arnhart 2005). Now there is growing evidence of the genetic heritability of political attitudes and the neurogenetic variations that govern disgust sensitivity, empathy, egalitarianism, intelligence, and other traits that shape political attitudes (Alford and Hibbing 2008; Hatemi et al. 2015).</p>
<p class="p">The second and still the most influential meaning of “biopolitics,” in the humanities, derives from the work of Michel Foucault. Throughout his career, in his work on mental illness (1965), medicine (1973), prisons (1977), and sexuality (1978), formalized in a series of lectures on biopolitics in 1978 and 1979 (2010), Foucault elaborated the idea that institutions develop biopower by creating structures of knowledge about bodies and populations. For Foucault, biopolitics was the effort of states to regulate bodies to ensure their productivity as workers, their obedience as citizens, and their conformity to social norms. This Foucauldian concept of biopolitics has been developed and applied widely, from Giorgio Agamben’s writings on death camps as the biopolitical telos of “thanatopolitics” (Agamben 1998) to Nikolas Rose’s (2007) explorations of biopower as key to modern governance to Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri’s neo-Marxist (2000) interpretation of biopolitics as a counterhegemonic struggle against biopower.</p>
<p class="p">The third use of “biopolitics” has been to encompass all the ways in which public policy shapes medicine, public health, and biotechnology. These topics were always present in the journal of the APLS and acknowledged as part of their scope, although an essay on these topics would rarely have been described as biopolitics. Now, however, there are a growing number of works drawing on the growing biopolitics literature, both ethological and Foucauldian, to illuminate health policy, such as Maren Klawiter’s 2008 <span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Biopolitics of Breast Cancer</span></span></span> and Jan Wright and Valerie Harwood’s (2009) <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Biopolitics and the “Obesity Epidemic”</span></span></span></em> collection.</p>
<p class="p">Fourth, the term “biopolitics” has been applied to the emergence of a new biopolitical axis, emerging out of bioethics, comparable to the political-economy and cultural axes that have dominated twentieth-century politics in the liberal democracies (James Hughes 2004, 2009). The origins of contemporary biopolitics can be found in the views of Enlightenment philosophy that advocated for individual autonomy, the use of reason, science, and technology to improve the human condition, the separation of church and state, and the importance of individual subjectivity to personal identity (Hughes 2010). These views formed the basis of liberal Western bioethics after World War II, and shaped the development of policies regulating abortion, animal rights, and death and dying, although at first with little involvement by mass political movements. The politicization of bioethics into biopolitics began with the emergence in the 1970s of the right-to-life movement, which made the rights-bearing status of embryonic life a defining ideological stance. Under the influence of philosophers like Peter Singer (1990), the growing animal rights movement made a parallel move articulating the rights-bearing status of animals. In the 1980s and 1990s these two movements forced an articulation of the biopolitical terrain between advocates of human exceptionalism and advocates of nonanthropocentric rights.</p>
<p class="p">By the mid-2000s, after the appointment of a conservative-dominated President’s Council on Bioethics (PCBE) by the Bush administration, American bioethicists had polarized into bioconservative and bioliberal camps with characteristic views on a wide variety of bioethical issues. After polarization, bioliberals drew sharper lines in defense of science, secular liberty, and individual autonomy. While bioconservatives in secular Europe are largely influenced by green politics, bioconservatives in the United States are predominantly religiously motivated. This polarization has reflected and been encouraged by the growing involvement of mass political groups in bioethics policy, from stem cell research to end-of-life care. Since bioconservatives and bioliberals come from both the Right and the Left, however, the biopolitical axis cuts across traditional political ideologies (Rifkin 2002; Sutti 2005; Moreno 2012). As green parties also asserted that they were beyond left and right when they first emerged, and then were assimilated into the broad Left, biopolitics may also succumb to the gravitational forces of the larger left-right political universe. On the other hand, the divisions within the Left and the Right over genetically modified organisms, reproductive technology, vaccination safety, and other issues illustrate the persistent orthogonality of biopolitics (Roache and Clarke 2009).</p>
<p class="p">Biopolitics are just beginning to emerge in the developing world, where they may develop along other lines, especially in Asia. Abrahamic beliefs about ensoulment lead to conflict over abortion, embryonic research, brain death, and animal rights, while Abrahamic beliefs in a divine plan for humanity are hard to square with plans for radical human enhancement. Unshaped by the West’s struggle between the Church and the Enlightenment, biopolitical thought in South and East Asia has a different structure. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism accept a moral and evolutionary continuity between animals, humans, and super-human beings. Surveys of bioethical opinion from India to Japan find far less resistance to genetic engineering and other emerging technologies than in the West (Macer 2014). While Western bioliberals combine individualism with techno-optimism, and Western bioconservatives trump rights claims with communitarian concerns, South and East Asian biopolitical thought often combines techno-optimism with communitarianism and authoritarianism.</p>
<p class="p">With the publication of Francis Fukuyama’s <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Our Posthuman Futur<span style="border: none;">e</span></span></span></span></em> (2002) and the PCBE’s critique of reproductive technology, cognitive enhancement, and life extension (Kass et al. 2003), the debate over human enhancement technologies moved from the fringe to the center of biopolitics. The PCBE focused on the bioconservative belief in an important distinction between the use of biotechnology for therapy as opposed to its use for enhancement, a line that when crossed would lead to hubris and disaster.</p>
<p class="p">While bioliberals like Nicholas Agar (2005), Arthur Caplan, Jonathan Moreno (2012), Julian Savulescu, and John Harris (2007) have defended human enhancement and other biomedical technologies, they do so with many qualifications. “Transhumanists” are the radicals on the biopolitical spectrum (Bostrom 2005; Miller 2006; James Hughes 2009). Ranging politically from anarchocapitalists (Bailey 2005) to leftist “technoprogressives” to millennialist “Singularitarians,” the transhumanists embrace radical life extension, cognitive enhancement, and body modification, including the uploading of consciousness to nonorganic platforms.</p>
<p class="p">Biopolitics in the context of the transhumanist-bioliberal-bioconservative debate incorporates competing visions about the desirability of various kinds of posthuman species or transhuman societies. Fukuyama argued that enhancement would fracture the biological similarity that supposedly undergirds democratic solidarity, an argument made more persuasively in Agar’s 2010 <span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;"><em>Humanity’s End</em>.</span></span></span> In response to this alleged threat, the left-leaning bioethicists George Annas and Lori Andrews have campaigned with bioconservative groups for an international treaty to make cloning and germline genetic therapy a “crime against humanity” (Annas, Andrews, and Isasi 2002). Green-leaning groups have broadened their attacks on gene-modified crops to include opposition to gene-modified humans, while left critics believe reproductive technology portends a new racist, classist, and patriarchal eugenics. At these extremes, biopolitics has developed its own revolutionary and apocalyptic wings presaged by the bombing campaign of the eco-primitivist Ted Kaczynski from the 1970s to the 1990s.</p>
<p class="p">Presumably, if the term “biopolitics” continues to be used, it will increasingly refer to ideological schisms around the regulation of biotechnology, and its associations with the Foucauldian or political science academy will decline.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="pf">Bioregionalism is a social movement and action-oriented field of study focused on enabling human communities to live, work, eat, and play sustainably within Earth’s dynamic web of life. At the heart of the matter is this core guiding principle: human beings are social animals; if we are to flourish as a species, we need healthy relationships and secure attachments in our living arrangements with one another and with the land, waters, habitat, plants, and animals upon which we depend. Unfortunately, we have lost our way. Humanity’s collective capacity to nurture healthy relationships and secure attachments is not being realized. Thus, bioregionalists argue, we need to establish new, just, ethical, and ecologically resilient ways to reconnect with one another and with the land.</p>
<p class="p">Bioregionalism’s core commitments include (1) rebuilding urban and rural communities—at a human scale—to nurture a healthy sense of place and to secure attachments and rootedness among community inhabitants; (2) reintegrating nature and human settlements in ways that holistically instill eco-efficiency, equity, and green cultural values into systems of production, consumption, and daily life; (3) making known (and valuing) the way wildlands, working landscapes, ecosystems, and rural dwellers and resources enable cities to exist; (4) developing authentic community-based participatory processes that empower just and equitable civic engagement in local and regional planning, visualization, and decision making; and (5) building global transbioregional alliances and knowledge networks to support sustainable place making around the world. To meet these commitments, bioregionalists engage in grassroots activism, group mediation, consensus building, not-for-profit and for-profit entrepreneurism, food and fiber production, ecological restoration, art, music, philosophy, spirituality, science, education, and multimedia communications.</p>
<p class="p">The spatial scale of bioregional initiatives varies. Bioregionalists focus on watersheds (“ridge top to ridge top”), multiple watersheds (“landscape scale”), river basins, and even much larger swaths of the Earth’s surface, including ocean regions. Kirkpatrick Sale (2000, 55), one of bioregionalism’s leading proponents, outlined three nested spatial scales pertinent to bioregionalism. The largest scale is the <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">ecoregion</span></span></span></em>—roughly twenty thousand square miles or more (e.g., Ozark Plateau in the United States, Sonoran Desert in Mexico, Chilean Mattoral). The scale beneath this is the <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">georegion</span></span></span></em> (e.g., the Central Valley of California nested within the Northern California Ecoregion). At the smallest end of the spectrum is what Sale calls <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">morphoregions</span></span></span></em> (several thousand or fewer square miles), identifiable by human settlement patterns, including cities, towns, infrastructure, factories, fields, and farms. These scales are nested one within the other. Globally minded bioregionalists of the twenty-first century will have to forge alliances to address problems that cut across these scales, and across urban-rural divides—for instance, global climate change; globalization of disease vectors; pandemic threats; acidification of the oceans; soil degradation; large-scale disasters; warfare; and injustices associated with race, class, and gender (Evanoff 2011; Hibbard et al. 2011; Pezzoli, Williams, and Kriletich 2010).</p>
<p class="p">Given the emphasis bioregionalism places on reconnecting people to the land in ways familiar to its inhabitants, it is at smaller scales where most bioregional action takes place. In people’s lived experience, bioregions are “life-places” where biogeography, ecology, culture, economy, and history interact in a distinct, discernable pattern. Peter Berg and Raymond Dasmann (1977, 400) coauthored one of the first documents in the United States to spell out the meaning of “bioregion”: “The term refers both to geographical terrain and a terrain of consciousness—to a place and the ideas that have developed about how to live in that place.” Inhabitants define for themselves their bioregion’s boundaries. The most relevant factors include climate, topography, flora, fauna, soil, and water together with the territory’s sociocultural characteristics, economy, and human settlement patterns.</p>
<p class="p">Robert L. Thayer Jr. (2003, 55), a widely noted bioregional activist-scholar, aptly argues that “the bioregion is emerging as the most logical locus and scale for a sustainable, regenerative community to take root and to <span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;"><em>take place</em>.</span></span></span>” That a bioregion is a fruitful place-based organizing concept stems from the premise that “a mutually sustainable future for humans, other life-forms, and earthly systems can best be achieved by means of a spatial framework in which people live as rooted, active, participating members of a reasonably scaled, naturally bounded, ecologically defined territory, or <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">life-place</span></span></span></em>” (Thayer 2003, 6).</p>
<p class="p">The aims of bioregional initiatives vary. In the United States, the Klamath Basin Coalition focuses on 15,751 square miles of land spanning the U.S. states of Oregon and California and drained by the Klamath River; it is a diverse alliance of local, regional, and national organizations promoting comprehensive social-ecological restoration and sustainable livelihoods in the Klamath River Basin (Doremus and Tarlock 2008; Gosnell and Clover Kelly 2010). The Kansas Area Watershed Bioregion is restoring the ecological health of the prairie and its inhabitants. California’s Biodiversity Council (CBC) subdivided the entire state of California into ten bioregions as part of a watershed/landscape scale strategy to protect biological diversity and the economy. In northern California, a range of bioregional groups is focusing on fishing, water quality, timber, and agriculture in ways that address livelihood and conservation. Beyond the United States, the governments of seven Central American countries plus Mexico created a Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, which pays homage to bioregional principles for the protection of biodiversity. New Zealand divided its entire national territory into ecoregions and watershed-based subregions for bioregional policy and planning purposes, backed by an environmental court system (including landscape architects).</p>
<p class="p">Bioregional initiatives conducted at the national and international scale do not necessarily advance the more radical aspects of bioregionalism (e.g., authentic participatory democracy, communitarianism, subsidiarity, mutual aid). Yet national and international efforts may help reframe public discourse, thereby creating new opportunities to advance bioregionalism’s core commitments on the ground locally. This may happen, to cite an example, in Bolivia, where the country’s legislators passed the Law of Mother Earth in 2012.</p>
<p class="p">The Bolivian Law of Mother Earth is based on Andean philosophy that views “<em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Pachamama</span></span></span></em>” (a term used commonly throughout the Andean region, associated with “Mother Earth” but meaning a nongendered “Source of Light, or Source of Life” [cf. de la Cadena 2010]) as a sentient being and sacred home. Article 3 of the law defines Mother Earth as “the dynamic living system formed by the indivisible community of all life systems and living beings who are interrelated, interdependent, and complementary, which share a common destiny.” The law provides legal-institutional support for nature itself as a “collective subject” entitled to legal rights, including rights to life, ecosystem health, and regeneration. Whether or not the law generates significant change is far from certain. However, it may make it easier for indigenous movements to gain leverage for their causes using their cultural heritage and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)—including sophisticated agroecological knowledge accumulated over thousands of years. Some academics have referred to these Global South movements as “indigenous cosmopolitics” (de la Cadena 2010). Along such lines, the Zapatista movement in Chiapas, Mexico, rebuked neoliberalism in a quest for local autonomy and the preservation of their ecocultural heritage. These movements have much to offer twenty-first-century understandings of bioregionalism, especially when it comes to ecological governance, sustainable livelihoods, and management of common wealth. Indigenous struggles around food sovereignty are a strong case in point (Adamson 2012b).</p>
<p class="p">Bioregionalists tend to fault foot-loose transnational finance and the reckless growth of the world’s resource-intensive, export-oriented, hypermobile, corporate-dominated global economy for many of the twenty-first century’s increasingly complex problems (e.g., climate change, peak oil, peak fresh water, ecosystem degradation, runaway economic speculation, food insecurity, poverty, and a widening gap between haves and have-nots). In view of such problems, bioregionalists advocate “localization.” Localization is a place-based strategy to create sustainable and resilient communities at a human scale; it encourages local investments in resources, livelihoods, and institutions that build the community’s assets (including community power/capabilities) (De Young and Princen 2012).</p>
<p class="p">Peter Berg, Raymond Dasmann, Gary Snyder, Robert G. Bailey, Freeman House, and Ian McHarg, among others, laid the initial foundation for bioregional thought and practice in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s. This early work has roots in utopian and anarchist ideas from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries (Owen; Fourier; Proudhon; Bakunin; Kropotkin) and in the call for ecological regionalism first articulated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Geddes; Howard; Odum; Mumford; the Regional Planning Association of America). Bioregionalism in the United States initially developed outside academia. Its identity was countercultural—a back-to-the-land and appropriate-technology movement responding to the perceived failings of North American and Eurocentric conceptions of industrial modernism. Gary Snyder, a civically engaged intellectual and poet, along with Peter Berg, helped get bioregionalism onto a serious academic footing by interweaving counterculturalism with incisive critical analysis and methodology (Snyder 1995; Berg 2009). They accomplished this through civically engaged scholarship and effective science communication enriched with poetry, theater, art, and experiential learning. Doug Aberley (1999), Michael Vincent McGinnis (1999), Robert L. Thayer Jr. (2003), and Tom Lynch et al. (2012), among others, have also added academic rigor to bioregionalism.</p>
<p class="p">Doug Aberley (1999, 13) provides a good historical overview of bioregionalism’s development over time, outlining how bioregionalists worldwide have “learned the cultural and biophysical identity of their home territories—their bioregions. They have also worked to share the lessons of this hard-won experience, developing intersecting webs of bioregional connection that now stretch across the planet.” Bioregionalism has a track record that includes semiannual congresses (meetings of upwards of two hundred bioregional enthusiasts, from North America mainly but also from other countries around the world). The Planet Drum Foundation (www.planetdrum.org) and the Bioregional Congress (www.bioregionalcongress.net) have been documenting and archiving the congresses. An increasing number of universities offer degrees in bioregionalism, including the University of Idaho, Utah State University, the University of California at Davis, Montana State University, and the University of Pennsylvania. Bioregional programs outside the United States can be found at universities in Mexico, Asia, Europe, and Australia, among other places.</p>
<p class="p">The number of organizations advocating bioregional principles (though not always identifying themselves as bioregionalists) is growing. In the United States, the New Economy Working Group (a progressive, multipartner, action-oriented think tank) highlights the possibility and potential of localized living economies that support a healthy biosphere (www.neweconomyworkinggroup.org). Ecotrust, based in Portland, Oregon, operates an environmental bank, an ecosystem investment fund, and a range of programs in fisheries, forestry, food, farms, and indigenous affairs (www.ecotrust.org). On a global scale, Bioneers, a group of social and scientific innovators, grows social capital by building bioregional and community-based alliances (www.bioneers.org). The Global Action Research Center (the Global ARC) uses bioregionalism as a framework to help connect the dots among diverse types of globally minded localization (e.g., community gardens, watershed protection, greening of livelihoods, and infrastructure) (www.theglobalarc.org).</p>
<p class="p">At the dawn of the twenty-first century, bioregionalism has an increasingly effective set of tools and concepts from which to draw, including locavore, locavesting, slow foods, food justice, green infrastructure, adapting-in-place, eco-districts, biocapacity, ecological footprint, BALLE (business alliance for local living economies), LOIS (local ownership and import substitution), community-based natural resource management (CBNRM), relocalization, and reinhabitation. The efficacy of bioregionalism as a movement hinges on the application of such tools and concepts through learn-by-doing and “living-in-place.” Nurturing bioregional culture and imagination is key. Fortunately, there are an increasing number of groups skilled at doing this—i.e., skilled at cultivating place-based environmental literacy and a new ecological progressivism through the arts and humanities (Lynch et al. 2012). California Northern is a good example (www.calnorthern.net). Their work provides a deeper understanding of bioregions by fostering strong local identity through effective place-based storytelling, art, and communications. Along such lines, Thayer Jr. (2003, 94) expresses hope that as bioregional groups struggle to reinhabit their life-place, “A distinctly regional art, aesthetics, literature, poetics and music can evolve from and support bioregional culture.” This hope has deep roots; it resonates with a view expressed three-quarters of a century ago by Lewis Mumford. In his classic work <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">The Culture of Cities</span></span></span></em> (1938), Mumford eloquently argued that “[t]he re-animation and re-building of regions, as deliberate works of collective art, is the grand task of politics for the coming generation.” This oft-quoted statement rings as true today as it did seventy-five years ago.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="pf">Biosemiotics, or semiotic biology, is the study of qualitative semiotic processes that are considered to exist in a variety of forms down to the simplest living organisms and to the lowest levels of biological organization. Biosemiotics can be seen as an alternative to the mainstream approaches of contemporary evolutionary biology that use reductionist quantitative methodologies and tend to objectify living processes. Emphasizing the role of sign processes in nature makes it possible to restore the “subjectness” or agency of living organisms that in turn are considered to influence larger ecological and evolutionary processes. Here, a sign process or “semiosis” is defined as a process, in which something—a sign—stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity (Peirce 1931–1935, 228). A simple example is a bird song that indicates to the singer’s species mates that he is guarding his nesting ground. In biosemiotics, processes taking place inside an organism, such as interpretation of DNA for protein synthesis by a cell, are also regarded as sign processes. Although, up until now, biosemiotics has been a paradigm mostly in the biological sciences, this field of study is increasingly referred to in cultural and literary studies.</p>
<p class="p">As a discipline, biosemiotics emerged from comparative studies of animal communication conducted by the Hungarian-American semiotician Thomas A. Sebeok in the 1960s (and referred to, at the time, as “zoosemiotics,” Sebeok 1972, 1990). Semiotic approaches to animal communication provided biosemiotics with the concepts of repertoire, code, and context that connect the parties of communication and make mutual understanding possible. Later reconstructions of the history of biosemiotics trace the field back to German biology, mostly to the <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Umwelt</span></span></span></em> theory of Jakob von Uexküll (1982), and to theories of the American philosopher and semiotician Charles S. Peirce. Uexküll’s <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Umwelt</span></span></span></em> theory gives biosemiotics its subject-centered perspective. <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Umwelt</span></span></span></em> theory describes an organism’s relations with its environment as shaped by its species-specific perceptual and cognitive capacities and organized by meanings that bind the animal to living and nonliving entities in its environment. An important principle for biosemiotics is to consider semiotic and biological processes as they appear to the organism and to treat biological communities as the sum of interconnecting <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Umwelten</span></span></span></em>. Relying on Peirce’s semiotics helps biosemioticians to study semiotic processes in other species. Peirce’s understanding of sign differs in important respects from the other major semiotic tradition, the semiology of Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, who proposed a two-part model of the sign. In contrast, the Peircean sign is tripartite (including the “object” that can also be an environmental object) and does not rely on the existence of (human) language. These properties make Peircean semiotics suitable for describing sign processes occurring outside the human species.</p>
<p class="p">Synthesizing different intellectual traditions allows biosemioticians to raise questions about both the general properties of biological communication systems and the special position of human language therein. For instance, is the combination of digital and analogical codes (such as DNA and behavioral codes) necessary for the development of any complex biological system (Hoffmeyer and Emmeche 1991), are there any special rules for communication between the members of the different species (Maran 2012), or what are the similarities and differences between the codes that cells use for interpreting DNA and the codes of human language? Early efforts to organize the field of biosemiotic studies followed largely taxonomical logic by distinguishing zoosemiotics (semiotic study of animals, see Maran, Martinelli, and Turovski 2011) and phytosemiotics (semiotic study of plants, Krampen 1981). Later alternative classifications following hierarchical logic were proposed that distinguished between endosemiotics (study of semiotic processes inside organism), zoosemiotics (study of semiotic processes between animal organisms), and ecosemiotics or ecosystem semiotics (study of semiotic aspects of ecological processes, Nielsen 2007) or were based on the mechanisms of sign processes, distinguishing between the study of vegetative (based on analogical relations and recognition), animal (based on physical linkage and associations), and cultural (based on symbolic relations and conventions) semiosis (Kull 2009).</p>
<p class="p">In the last decade, biosemiotics has advanced significantly, as exemplified by the establishment of the International Society for Biosemiotic Studies, the launch of the journal and book series, both named <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Biosemiotics</span></span></span></em>, and the emergence of biosemiotic courses in curricula of many universities (for historical overviews, see Kull 1999; Favareau 2009). At present the most intriguing topics in biosemiotics seem to include the role of codes and coding in semiotic processes (Barbieri 2010; Markoš and Faltýnek 2011), as well as developing semiotic views on biological evolution (see Schilhab, Stjernfelt, and Deacon 2012). The logic of biosemiotic inquiry can be demonstrated by research questions provided by Kull, Emmeche, and Favareau’s 2008 essay, “Biosemiotic Questions”: what are the major modes of biosemiosis? How does the world appear to the organism, and what are the methods that allow the study of subjective worlds (<em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Umwelten</span></span></span></em>)? What are the general biological functions that are made possible through the phenomenon of semiosis? These questions can be used, for instance, to think about the process of recognition. Recognition is clearly an <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Umwelt</span></span></span></em>-specific phenomenon, as humans do not perceive the same signs (or at least not in the same way) as other animals. Recognition may be a key for important biological functions: for instance, reproduction in most cases is not possible without recognition of the mate. Being a qualitative process, recognition requires special methods of study (<em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Umwelt</span></span></span></em> modeling, participatory observation). One example of practical research where biosemiotics has been applied includes the ongoing search for minimal biological entities that show any activity in perceiving and producing signs (e.g., “autocell” in Deacon 2006). Biosemiotic concepts have also been fruitfully applied in landscape ecology to study the engagement of different species with the environment, their use of resources, and their interaction and conflicts both with one another and with human influences (Farina 2008).</p>
<p class="p">Biosemiotics is also contributing to studies of human culture as it is taken up by ecocritics (see Garrard, this volume), ecofeminists (see Gaard, this volume), and multispecies ethnographers (see Rose, this volume), among others. “Biosemiotic criticism,” as I have termed it (Maran 2014), is attracting a number of scholars from environmental literary criticism and other environmental humanities (e.g., Wheeler 2008; Coletta 1999; Maran 2010; Tüür 2009; Siewers 2011). Biosemiotics broadens the reach of sign processes into the biological realm as well as into the inner milieu of the human organism, providing the humanities a substantiated expansion beyond human cultural processes and artefacts. There are several possible approaches in biosemiotic criticism. For instance, biosemiotic tools can be applied to cultural phenomena on the basis of analogies between biological organisms and human culture, or through study of different ways that humans and other animals model their surrounding environment (Sebeok 1991), or through study of representations of semiotic processes either from inside or from outside the human body or from the environment. An example of the latter would be to inquire into the ways in which human bodily perceptions and reactions (having a cold, developing an immune reaction, recovering from an injury or a shock) relate to creation and interpretation of literary and artistic works.</p>
<p class="p">Biosemiotic criticism can be invoked to ask questions such as, what are the roles and relations between different modeling processes in cultural representations? Thomas A. Sebeok has distinguished between linguistic and zoosemiotic types of modeling. Linguistic modeling based on human language is specific to the human species, whereas zoosemiotic modeling unites humans with other animals. Zoosemiotic modeling is based on <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Umwelt</span></span></span> </em>structure, where signs distinguished by the organism’s species-specific perceptual organs are aligned with its behavioral resources (Sebeok 1991). On the basis of this distinction we can ask, where and in what forms does prelinguistic zoosemiotic modeling occur in humans? In literary studies, what is the role of the author and readers as biological semiotic creatures in literature and other cultural artifacts? Are there traces of zoosemiotic modeling in nature essays and in other cultural representations of nature? In which ways do different models and representations of nature loop back to influence the material structures of the world? For instance, in nature essays, authors are often present in the text as bodily creatures perceiving their environment by sights, sounds, smells, and touch. From the perspective of biosemiotic criticism, representing not just the environment but also subtle semiotic ways of relating to the environment (so-called sensory sign, Hornborg 2001) appears to be an important communicative and didactic strategy.</p>
<p class="p">The research program of biosemiotic criticism is still at a very early stage of development and is waiting for further practical applications to different research objects as well as for syntheses with paradigms of both environmental humanities and semiotics of culture. In any case, biosemiotic criticism is coming to be considered a viable alternative to other paradigms, like Darwinian literary studies or posthumanism, that seek to overcome the culture-nature divide.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="pf">All forms of life and the three environmental matrices of atmosphere, soils, and oceans form a closely integrated network that can be called the “biosphere.” Thus the biosphere is the system with four main internal, interacting components: air, water, soil, and life. Considering this system, what makes the biosphere dynamically distinct from other layers of Earth, such as lithosphere, mantle, or core, is undoubtedly the presence and influence of life.</p>
<p class="p">Alternative uses of the word “biosphere” in environmental writings, both technical and popular, are (1) the zone that life inhabits or (2) simply, the sum of all of life. Regarding the first, because bacteria are found in deepest ocean sediments, and even floating in air currents, there is little to gain by trying to distinguish it from the definition used in this essay, in terms of where the biosphere begins or ends. Regarding the second, there is an adequate and more precise alternative term for all of life, and that is “global biota.”</p>
<p class="p">Even with the definition used here—a system with four components—one might be curious about system boundaries. The biosphere’s upper boundary is clearly the top of the atmosphere, which is crossed by incoming solar radiation, outgoing infrared radiation from Earth that exits to space, and minute quantities of space dust. Of course, once in a great while there is also the killer asteroid or two.</p>
<p class="p">The biosphere’s lower boundary is admittedly fuzzier. Groundwater reaches kilometers down into pores of rock, and bacteria have been found kilometers down, too. But we can exclude from the definition of the biosphere the minerals in rocks underneath the soil, using the logic that the chemical elements in those rocks have been outside of active circulation in air, water, or soil for millions or hundreds of millions of years. With this logic, which helps clarify the definition of the biosphere, we gain at least two practical results: (1) a focus on the physical fact that creatures live within and exchange gases, liquids, and solids with the environmental matrices of air, soil, and ocean as a system, and (2) an appropriately integrated, bounded system for technical modeling of the impacts of organisms on the chemistry of the global environment on relatively short time scales.</p>
<p class="p">With boundaries, we can inquire into the matter and energy that cross them. The simple upper boundary of the biosphere has been noted. What about its lower boundary? Though compared to the solar and infrared fluxes of energy across the upper boundary, the energy coming up across the lower boundary from the deep Earth is trivial in terms of magnitude; but it is not trivial in terms of effects. The upwelling of deep Earth heat, most visible in volcanoes and deep ocean vents but present everywhere, is responsible for mountain ranges, the movements of continents, the opening and closing of oceans. Across the biosphere’s lower boundary, there is matter transfer, too. Chemical weathering of minerals at rock interfaces as well as material and gases that come from volcanoes and deep-sea ocean vents result in inputs of fresh matter upwards into the biosphere. Exiting fluxes that leave the biosphere by going relatively permanently downward include the burial of minerals and organic sediments. These processes remove chemical elements from what had been their times of active circulation among the four components of the biosphere.</p>
<p class="p">A look into its interior time scales sheds light upon the dynamics of the biosphere. There are exchanges of materials among the four main components, and therefore the entire biosphere is circulating (chemically speaking) according to the mixing times of its components. For example, studies of isotopes in the ocean have demonstrated that the huge ocean, from its surface down to depths that average about four kilometers, mixes completely in about a thousand years. Soils can be said to “circulate” on the basis of the times of disintegration of materials that enter soil as detritus from organisms, such as the drop of tree leaves but also including the dying of plant roots. In addition, creatures such as worms that live in the soil literally mix it. The time scales involved here depend on the quality of the materials put into the soil, but we can roughly cite durations of tens to hundreds of years for mixing of most soil (sites such as tundra can be exceptions).</p>
<p class="p">The atmosphere is in constant and rapid motion. Earth’s wind-driven, swirling layer of air circulates in merely a year. This is why rising levels of the greenhouse gas CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are essentially the same over Antarctica’s ice sheets as they are over the average of North America. Coupled with the fact of the relative inertness of fossil fuel combustion’s waste gas CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the rapid mixing of the global atmosphere is the reason why the ever-increasing greenhouse effect is a truly global problem not isolated to source regions of emissions, and is therefore different from many other pollution problems. One can hope that a positive side effect of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; challenge is to make Earth’s citizens more aware of their shared interest in the biosphere.</p>
<p class="p">This mention of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; brings us to the topic of the impacts on life within the biosphere system. Two points need to be introduced. First, there are exchanges of matter among the three environmental matrices (air, soil, ocean) that take place without life. Gases move back and forth between ocean and atmosphere, across the air-sea interface. Rain and wind bring dust with elements such as iron from the continents to the ocean. Of course, the oceans are the main source of water to the continents, via water vapor in the atmosphere and the hydrological cycle. Rain that enters soil will dissolve minerals from soil particles and carry these as ions to the ocean by rivers.</p>
<p class="p">Second, because all organisms bring materials into their bodies from their environments through their membranes, skins, mouths, and other boundary-pores, whether living as single independent cells or as great blue whales, the creatures act as mechanisms for exchange within the biosphere, too. Organisms must get rid of wastes, which they also do through a variety of membranes and body pores and openings. Green leaves, for example, bring CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into their bodies through tiny pores in their leaves that allow the air to pass in, from which their cells strip some of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  as a source of carbon to build their bodies. Those same pores, the stomata, release oxygen to the air. Oxygen is a waste byproduct from the plant’s photosynthesis, and it just happens to be what oxygen-requiring heterotrophs such as animals and many microbes need to consume organic materials as food, creating waste CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the process, which they release and the plants can then use.</p>
<p class="p">Actually, this neat linkage doesn’t “just happen.” One of the drivers of evolutionary change in the metabolisms of organisms is the presence of waste materials from other species circulating in the environmental matrices of the biosphere. These waste materials become available to those creatures who can figure out (evolutionarily speaking) how to use the wastes as, well, nutrients.</p>
<p class="p">So living things flux materials in and out of their bodies: various forms of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, oxygen, calcium, and other chemical elements. These materials leave and enter the environmental matrices of air, water, and soil. Bring in the nearly four-billion-year-old process of evolution operating in the lives and deaths of organisms. The result is the presence of what are known as global biogeochemical cycles, a great and unique feature of the biosphere.</p>
<p class="p">All the bio-essential elements have unique stories. Sometimes two or more elements travel together for portions of their individual cycles. For example, when you consume a fresh ear of sweet corn, carbon and nitrogen within the corn enter your body together (there is carbon and nitrogen in the amino acids of the corn’s proteins, and carbon in its sweet carbohydrates, which you ingest at the same time). In such situations the flux of one element closely corresponds to the flux of another, in proportions required by the living cells of corn, in the case just cited.</p>
<p class="p">Sometimes the pathways of the biogeochemical cycles are decoupled. For example, there are microbes in soils and ocean waters called denitrifiers (many species). These denitrifiers can utilize nitrate ions in the soil’s pore water or ocean water as an oxidizer and then some of them release, at the end of a chain of reactions, a waste gas, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the most abundant gas in Earth’s atmosphere. In these reactions, nitrogen as a chemical element is traveling its own pathway, separate from the biogeochemical cycle of carbon, to which it is sometimes tied, as the eating of corn showed.</p>
<p class="p">The coupling and decoupling of segments within the biogeochemical cycles of various bio-essential elements means that each element has its own branch of science within the study of the biosphere. However, one overarching fact is that life is a major player in the workings of biosphere. These fluxes and exchanges caused by organisms, summed under the heading of the effects of the global biota, are significant and usually rival or surpass those fluxes and exchanges that are purely physical between ocean, air, and soil noted above.</p>
<p class="p">For example, the carbon that flows annually as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into plants and algae in global photosynthesis is roughly the same amount as the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that passes back and forth across the global ocean’s entire air-sea interface. As another example, in the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into forms of nitrogen usable by plants, both soil bacteria and lightning can do the job. But bacteria dominate the rate of conversion.</p>
<p class="p">What this means is that there is no understanding of Earth’s surface system that provides us with habitat—the biosphere—without an understanding of life as an integral part of that system. The giant effects of life make predicting the future of the biosphere particularly challenging. A nontrivial portion of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; we inject into the atmosphere is being incorporated into tree bodies or soil carbon somewhere, and it has been difficult to discern the details. How will the biological carbon in the peat of the high latitudes respond to climate change? How will marine ecosystems respond to an increase or decrease of nitrogen fertilizer that runs off from croplands in rivers? We humans are all connected to all other creatures, from the mighty to the microbial, and with all of them to the environmental matrices, making such questions and the understandings already won pertinent and also poignant.</p>

The built environment might thus include not only structures and sites such as buildings, roads, bridges, parks, and playgrounds but also (and more broadly) land-use patterns, transportation systems, architecture, and design (Saelens and Handy 2008; Bartuska 2007). Closely identified with cities but not exclusively urban, and often regarded in the modern era as separate from or even opposed to the “natural” environment—epitomized by Lewis Mumford’s formulation, “As the pavement spreads, nature is pushed farther away” (Mumford 1938)—the built environment did not figure prominently in early currents of environmentalism either in the United States or globally. In the last decades of the twentieth century, however, theorists and practitioners alike began to question this absence. “Why is it that we tend to think of the built environment of cities as somehow or other not being the environment?” asked geographer David Harvey in the late 1990s. “There is, it seems to me, nothing particularly anti-ecological about cities. Why should we think of them that way?” (Harvey 1997).</p>
<p class="p">Today the built environment is increasingly regarded as vitally involved in many of the central questions of environmental studies, including sustainability, climate change, and environmental justice. Part of this shift can be attributed to the growing realization that the perceived dichotomy between “natural” and “built” environments is a false one. As environmental historian Ari Kelman notes, the field of landscape studies in particular, which rejects the simplistic binary of “human” and “nature” in favor of recognizing (in D. W. Meinig’s words) an “intricate intermingling of physical, biological, and cultural features” in every environment has helped expose the artificiality of this divide (Kelman 2003; Meinig 1979).</p>
<p class="p">This shift also gained momentum after the widely publicized announcement by the United Nations in 2007 that for the first time in human history more than half the world’s population would be living in cities by 2008. The report also predicted new urban growth on an “unprecedented scale,” particularly in the developing world, where the population in towns and cities is expected to double by 2030 (United Nations Population Fund 2007). A more recent report anticipates that this “second wave” of urbanization will place 80 percent of the world’s population in cities by 2050, with most of the growth occurring in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean (United Nations Environment Programme 2012). Even acknowledging that the density of cities may make them more energy efficient than the landscape of sprawl, this growth carries substantial implications for global energy consumption and materials use. Given the expectation that this growth may also exacerbate rather than alleviate global inequality, poverty, and vulnerability to climate change, it also carries substantial implications for environmental justice.</p>
<p class="p">“Green” or sustainable design represents one approach (or more accurately, an ensemble of approaches) to the challenges presented by the exponential growth of the built environment. Engineers, architects, landscape architects, planners, and designers are seeking new materials, principles, and techniques to make buildings, infrastructures, and technologies more sustainable and resource efficient. In the building and construction industry, for example, the nonprofit U.S. Green Building Council promotes a certification program known as LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) that identifies green buildings according to a set of rating systems and credits. Initially restricted to the United States, LEED now certifies buildings globally. Many other countries also have their own green building certification programs, some of which, such as the U.K.’s BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) and Germany’s DGNB (German Sustainable Building Council) also have an international presence (Galbraith 2012).</p>
<p class="p">These certification programs, particularly LEED, have not been without their detractors. LEED has been criticized, for example, for allowing buildings to accumulate points even for elements that have no practical purpose, such as installing bicycle racks and showers in a building that is difficult to reach by bike. Critics argue that such practices inadvertently enable forms of greenwashing (or “LEED-washing”). A more serious charge sometime levied against performance-based standards for green buildings such as LEED is that by focusing on individual structures, they neglect the context in which those structures are embedded. A highly energy-efficient building, for example, might only be reachable by employees who must drive there in automobiles, rendering the overall environmental gains suspect (Bowen 2014). Global certification programs have also been criticized for ignoring or downplaying regional and local environmental differences in favor of one-size-fits-all technology and design.</p>
<p class="p">Recent academic scholarship on the modern built environment in a broad range of fields—including environmental history, urban studies, civil and environmental engineering, architecture, geography, sociology, literature, postcolonial studies, and critical race theory—is bringing many new questions to the forefront, from the role of waste and environmental management in urban life (Foote and Mazzolini 2012; Douglas 2013) to the prospects for sustainability in the post–Rio Summit era (Roberts, Ravets, and George 2009; Bulkeley 2013) to the impact of race, class, and gender on the social and physical experience of the built environment (Taylor 2009; Gleason 2011; Harris 2012). New studies of antiquity, moreover, are reintroducing the sustainable technologies of ancient architects and planners—from the passive cooling of Indian stepwells to the sewerage systems of Mesopotamia—to the greening of the built environment today (Melosi 1981; Livingston 2002; J. Donald Hughes 2009). In short, there remains no place but the center of environmental studies for the built environment to be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="pf">Climate change is a significant shift, over a long period of time, in the statistical profile of weather patterns. For most of geologic history, natural factors—solar radiation, continental drift, oceanic circulation, volcanic activity—have forced these shifts. In the period since the late nineteenth century, anthropogenic global warming (AGW) displays the impact of industrial activity, largely through the concentration of greenhouse gases generated by the burning of fossil fuels. AGW can be seen as one component of the “Anthropocene,” an unofficial chronological term that acknowledges the significant influence of human behavior on the Earth’s ecosystems. Most scientists who favor the naming of this new geological era date its onset to the commencement of the Industrial Revolution, but some backdate it to the rise of agriculture, when humans began to transform land use and biodiversity on a large and global scale.</p>
<p class="p">While many human activities are destructive of local ecosystems, emissions of greenhouse gases—carbon dioxide and methane above all—command most attention today because of their contribution to rising temperatures. Documented consequences of AGW include the retreat of glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice, ocean acidification, soil salinization, desertification, habitat inundation, mega-drought, loss of food security, mass species extinctions, and the more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events. All the available evidence shows that each of these phenomena have been occurring for some time, and that some are proceeding much more rapidly than predicted.</p>
<p class="p">Because these declines are not abrupt, they are not perceived as catastrophic—the Hollywood iconography of natural disaster is spectacular and short-term, and it holds sway over the popular imagination. Nonetheless, large-scale trigger points, such as Arctic methane release from widespread permafrost thaw or the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, have the potential to cause precipitous and irreversible climate change, or what climatologists refer to as Dangerous Anthropogenic Interference (DAI). The threshold for DAI is commonly recognized as a temperature rise of more than 2.0°C (3.6°F) above preindustrial levels, or 450 parts per million (ppm) of atmospheric carbon dioxide, although not a few climate scientists have put the critical limit around the 400 ppm mark.</p>
<p class="p">In 1824 Joseph Fourier was the first scientist to suggest that greenhouse gases helped to warm the Earth’s lower atmosphere by absorbing and emitting infrared radiation. This “greenhouse effect” was investigated quantitatively by Svante Arrhenius in 1896. Contemporary estimates show that the atmospheric volume of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels has risen from preindustrial levels of 275 ppm to 397 ppm. Thermometer data records show that the Earth’s mean surface temperature has increased by about 0.8°C (1.4°F) since the early twentieth century. About two-thirds of the increase has occurred since 1980. The detection of this AGW signal has been further corroborated by climate profiles of much longer historical span generated from analyses of ice cores and sediment, as well as floral and faunal and sea-level records.</p>
<p class="p">The most authoritative scientific surveys of human-induced climate change are produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). These comprehensive assessments (the last issued in 2007, the next in 2014) are supposed to provide policy advice in the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Progress in the international treaty process of the UNFCCC has been hampered by the reluctance of the major carbon powers—the United States and China especially—to enter into binding agreements about emission-reduction targets. The race to decarbonize has many willing contestants, but their number does not include those whose contribution would have the biggest impact. Among the obstacles standing in the way of international policy making is the powerful lobbying pressure of the fossil fuel industries, widely perceived to be responsible for encouraging “climate change denial” (Washington and Cook 2011; Norgaard 2011).</p>
<p class="p">The prospect that inadequate political action will guarantee the continuing rise in emissions has generated widespread concern on the part of scientists, a community not readily distinguished by a rush to judgment, let alone by public alarmism. Their increasingly activist standpoint can be contrasted with that of oceanographer Roger Revelle’s milestone 1956 testimony to Congress about the rise of CO<span class="sub"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">2</span></span></span> emissions. “From the standpoint of meteorologists and oceanographers,” he submitted, “we are carrying out a tremendous geophysical experiment of a kind that could not have happened in the past or be reproduced in the future” (Revelle 1956, 467). His choice of words has long been criticized for suggesting that the increase of atmospheric CO<span class="sub"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">2</span></span></span> presented merely a rare opportunity for scientists to study its impact. That clinical mentality no longer prevails. Natural scientists are in the forefront of lobbying for radical policy measures to address the climate crisis, issuing periodic warnings, signed by the leading figures in a variety of fields, beginning with the 1992 “World Scientists’ Warning to Humanity.”</p>
<p class="p">Today, it is the task of averting drastic climate change that might be described as an experiment—a vast social experiment in decision making and democratic action. Stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations will require concerted action on the part of political and economic elites as well as comprehensive shifts in the routine behavior of general populations, especially in carbon-rich countries. Success in that endeavor will not be determined primarily by large-scale technological fixes, though some—such as building an adequate infrastructure for sustainable energy sources—will be needed. Just as decisive to the outcome is whether our social relationships, cultural beliefs, and political customs will allow for the kind of radical changes that are necessary. That is why the climate crisis is as much a social as a biophysical challenge. Moreover, if this social experiment is to avoid an authoritarian turn, then its mechanisms of public consent cannot be bypassed by geo-engineering schemes, such as seeding the oceans with iron or reflecting sunlight though orbiting mirrors and brightened clouds (Kintisch 2010; Fleming 2010). Such schemes for intervening in complex and unpredictable natural systems are likely to generate a variety of unintended consequences, both geophysical and sociological.</p>
<p class="p">In addition, as part of a new phase of green capitalist development, most technical green innovations are being targeted toward the affluent populations in the market segment known as LOHAS, or Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability, covering almost 20 percent of adult consumers in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. LOHAS evangelists assume that reforming the high carbon consumption of this population may be enough to stave off the scenarios of eco-collapse. The problem is that the carbon savings to be gotten out of this 20 percent cannot possibly outweigh the commercial neglect of the other 80 percent (Jones 2008). The sociology of climate change has made it quite clear that no one can opt out, or be left behind. Either the green wave has to lift all boats, or else we may find ourselves with the dismal “lifeboat ethics” first proposed by ecologist Garret Hardin—where those not already on board are left behind (Hardin 1974).</p>
<p class="p">Advocates of climate justice, who draw attention to the uneven geographic distribution of environmental risks, argue that sustainable technologies need to be developed as remedies for social inequalities. Otherwise, affluent communities in the Global North and in the global cities of the South will turn into eco-enclaves, hoarding resources and knowledge about resilience from others. If resources tighten rapidly, a more ominous future beckons in the form of triage crisis management, where populations are selected for protection inside these eco-enclaves, while those outside or across the borders are abandoned. In the “climate wars” to come, the threat of global warming will increasingly be used to shape immigration policies around a vision of affluent nations or regions as heavily fortified resource islands.</p>
<p class="p">Anti-immigrant sentiment in the North has been stoked by fears about population pressure on resources, and by the manipulation, on the part of right-wing nativists, of the new carbon consciousness—immigrants, it is imputed, increase their carbon footprints when they move to the North. Among the broad social spectrum of border crossers, climate migrants (alternately termed “environmental migrants” or “climate refugees”) pose a particular ethical dilemma. This fast-rising population comprises those forced off their land or deprived of their livelihoods by the impact of climate change. A much greater population is being severely impacted by climate change but cannot, for one reason or another, leave their homes. Migrants who cross borders, especially from poor to rich countries, attract the most attention. Alarmist estimates of their numbers feed into neo-Malthusian sentiment about overpopulation, on the rise again since the mid-1990s despite the overall slowing demographic trend in population growth. Those who migrate within the borders of poorer countries do not generally register as a concern among overpopulationists. China, for example, has tens of millions of internal climate migrants—set in motion by increased droughts, flooding, coastal erosion, saltwater inundation, glacial melt in the Himalayas, and shifting agricultural zones—but they are not recognized, identified, or counted as a distinct population, nor do they attract the anxious ire of groups like the UK’s Population Matters (formerly the Optimum Population Trust) and the United States’ Population Connection (formerly Zero Population Growth).</p>
<p class="p">Those who are counted as climate refugees numbered in the tens of millions globally by 2000, and estimates from the IPCC, the 2006 Stern Report, and other sources predict that climate change will generate upwards of two hundred million such refugees by 2050 (Myers 2001; Stern 2006). To date, no international convention has recognized the needs and rights of climate migrants, even though, by 2010, according to the Red Cross’s estimate, they had outnumbered the population of refugees from war and violence (International Federation 2001). The International Committee on Migration has been pushing for multilateral legal recognition, though the consequences are not clear. Some fear that legal refugee classification would only create another level of second- or third-class immigrant status that would hold migrants in limbo. More promising are the moral demands that issue from the climate justice movement, which has embraced climate migrants as a living embodiment of the debt owed by carbon-rich beneficiaries of industrialization in the North to populations in the South most affected by the impact of climate change.</p>
<p class="p">Under these terms, what is owed to climate migrants? What rights and resources can they demand in compensation from the beneficiaries of carbon-rich industrialization whose emissions are responsible, however indirectly, for setting them in motion (Ross 2011)? They should be offered sanctuary and legal protection at the very least, but other forms of reparations may gravitate to the center of international treaty attention in the years to come.</p>
<p class="p">A similar understanding of repayment applies to this central principle of the climate justice movement that rich nations owe a carbon debt to poor ones. Advocates argue that reparations are appropriate since the industrial development of the North was achieved at the environmental expense of the South. Negotiations over the terms of this debt have been a sticking point in the biennial UNFCCC climate summits. In addition, representatives of southern nations insist that the industrialized countries transfer adequate resources, both financial and technological, to enable them to build renewable energy systems as part of a low-carbon pathway of development.</p>
<p class="p">Currently, the favored mode of negotiating climate debt is through carbon trading markets and mitigation swaps of the kind favored by the United Nations program Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD). Large industrial polluters buy pollution credits openly through the carbon markets, or they bargain for the right to continue polluting by purchasing a chunk of rainforest, most often without the consent of the indigenous communities who live there. Another way for them to evade direct climate debt repayment is to transfer accountability onto the consciences of individuals. This is an ongoing ideological shift, whereby individuals are encouraged to assess the carbon footprint of every personal act or material that they consume. The guilt and sense of responsibility is thereby reassigned, or outsourced, away from the large polluters who have the most effective power to lower emissions. This “carbon calculus” introduces a new kind of moral tyranny. Hydrocarbon becomes the loud scourge of our civilization, rather than an outlawed byproduct of it.</p>
<p class="p">For real evidence that progress is being made in building responses to the climate crisis, we can look to cities. Today, there is a thriving “sustainable cities” movement all over the developed world, and in many developing countries. Mayors toot their horns whenever their cities move up in the national sustainability rankings. Unlike state and federal lawmakers who rule on energy regulation, city managers and politicians are not subject to the fierce lobbying power of the fossil industries, so they are generally freer to push green policies. The Large Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) is comprised of forty of the world’s largest cities collaborating on extensive decarbonization programs. C40 issued its own Climate Communiqué at the UNFCCC summit in Copenhagen, in which mayors pleaded with the national representatives of the carbon powers to “recognize that the future of our globe will be won or lost in the cities of the world” (“C40” 2009). The mayors’ statement reflected a growing consensus that only in dense urban environments could efficient, low-carbon living be achieved on a mass scale. Humans are fast becoming an urban species, and our survival will depend on how we live in cities, which already consume 75 percent of the world’s energy and emit 80 percent of the greenhouse gases (Newman, Beatley, and Boyer 2009). Even without a decisive shift in energy supply away from fossil fuel, more compact patterns of urban growth are delivering a sizable boost to efforts at decarbonization.</p>
<p class="p">Advocates of urban sustainability push on a number of fronts: water conservation, decentralization of energy production and distribution, transformation of transit and transport, redesign of buildings and infrastructure, establishment of closed-loop waste systems, growth of a bioregional food supply, and municipal planning along carbon-neutral lines (Kahn 2006; Birch and Wachter 2008; Portney 2003). But if these initiatives do not take shape as remedies for social and geographic inequality, then they are likely to end up reinforcing existing patterns of environmental injustice. A “green gap” has already opened up between the eco-oases of affluent carbon-conscious communities and the human and natural sacrifice zones on the other side of the tracks, where populations have to fight to breathe clean air and drink uncontaminated water. To prevent this gap from widening, municipal administrations will have to break with the habit of making environmental policy solely at the behest of moneyed voters, and craft their sustainability plans as vehicles for civil rights, primed to deliver justice to those who have been sidelined, ghettoized, and stranded by a century and a half of unsustainable growth.</p>
<p class="p">The future of green governance hangs in the balance, and not only in those cities that have taken the lead in low-carbon policy making. What if the key to combating the climate crisis lies in innovating healthy pathways out of poverty for populations at risk, rather than marketing green gizmos to those who already have many eco-options to choose from? These are not mutually exclusive options. After all, the high-carbon lifestyles of affluent communities need to be targeted. But building a low-carbon economy by catering only to the LOHAS demographic will end up doing little more than adding a green gloss to patterns of chronic inequality. Likewise, placing all of our faith in clean-tech fixes will cede too much decision making to a closed circle of experts who, regardless of their technical prowess, will have no power to prevent the uneven application of their solutions.</p>
