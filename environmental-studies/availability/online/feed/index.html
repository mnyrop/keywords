				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="pf">“Biodiversity” was coined by E. O. Wilson in 1988 to describe all living organisms on the planet (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/wilson-edward-o/">Wilson 1988</a>); it is a condensation of “biological diversity.” It is more commonly used to describe all species other than humans; this creates an unfortunate dichotomy between the voting and nonvoting species! Economic, aesthetic, and health benefits that biodiversity contribute to the human economy are termed “ecosystem services” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/daily-gretchen/">Daily et al. 1997</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/daily-gretchen-c-2/">Daily et al. 2000</a>). We are only just beginning to quantify these and are rapidly realizing how dependent the quality of human life and economic well-being is upon biodiversity. Ironically, the current increasing rates of species extinction may provide the sharpest way to quantify human dependence upon biodiversity.</p>
<p class="p">Biodiversity’s greatest strength is its diversity; it includes huge organisms such as whales, and giant redwoods that live for centuries. At the opposite end of the spectrum are viruses and bacteria that are only visible under electron microscopy, including some of the most dangerous infectious agents on the planet: smallpox, anthrax, and influenza. The abundance of biodiversity is simultaneously its greatest problem; despite several centuries of biological investigation, we still have no exact idea of how many different species share the planet with us. Best estimates range between five and ten million; the number could be as high as one hundred million (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/may-robert-m-se-2/">May 1988</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/may-robert-m/">May 1990</a>). Because we do not know how many species are currently extant, we do not know how rapidly they are going extinct. Our best estimates suggest we are losing biodiversity at around one hundred to a thousand times the normal background rate of extinction (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/may-robert-m-6/">May et al. 1995</a>).</p>
<p class="p">Although the sheer diversity of species inhabiting the planet seems almost overwhelming, taxonomists, ecologists, and evolutionary biologists continue to find ways to organize it from perspectives that reflect the underlying process of speciation and the birth and death processes that both determine abundance and reflect interactions between species in their major roles as consumers of, and as resources for consumption by, other species. New biodiversity is created by speciation when the processes of natural and sexual selection act upon two or more subpopulations of the same species that are partially isolated from each other. If selection operates with sufficient intensity for long enough, then the original species will diverge to form two subspecies that will eventually be incapable of breeding with each other. The amount of biodiversity on the planet at any time always reflects the interaction between speciation and extinction rates. Ultimately, all extinct and extant species evolved from a common ancestor that lived in the primitive organic soup of the world’s oceans sometime between two and five billion years ago. The branching processes that are driven by speciation create a natural organization of species into a hierarchical treelike system of branches and twigs that define groups of closely related species with a common evolutionary ancestor (that may be now extinct). The first person to classify all known biological species in this way was Linnaeus (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/linnaeus-carl/">Linnaeus 1735</a>). Subsequent early classifications were based on the morphology of species; more recently this has been replaced by molecular trees that compare the DNA (or RNA) that contains the genetic code that drives the individual physical development of each individual of each species. Mutations in this code are the raw material upon which natural selection operates to modify structure and function and drive speciation. Subdivision of populations through time give rise to new species, which creates an evolutionary treelike structure for all species that have ever lived; the genetic relationships between species are defined by the branch lengths between them, and these define the total time since they shared a common ancestor.</p>
<p class="p">On a broader geographical scale, speciation and dispersal have tended to spread species from their commonest origin in the tropics out into the temperate and Arctic zones. This pattern has in turn been modified by the slow underlying breakup and movement of the continents: thus the oldest plant groups are found in New Caledonia and northeastern Australia, while an arc through Antarctica follows the main trunk and many of the major branches of the evolutionary tree of plants to colonize South America. The ancient diversity of plants then decreases as a subset of the original botanical diversity crosses the Atlantic and passes through Europe and down into Africa, or across the Urals into Asia. The strip of rainforest along the coast of Queensland contains nearly all of the world’s most ancient plant families; in contrast, although the forests of Indonesia and the Fynbos of South Africa have a huge number of plant species, they have mainly evolved recently as massive radiations of closely related species from within very few plant families. The insects that feed on these plants show similar patterns of radiation; in contrast, the geographical patterns in the mammals and birds are less distinct, given their much greater ability to disperse more rapidly. Once these patterns of speciation and radiation were recognized, many creation myths were quickly tripped up, particularly the Christian one: it is essentially impossible to reconcile the simultaneous creation of ten million species with the observed underlying genetic and geographical structure of biological diversity that reflects sequential, hierarchical, and intrinsically timed evolutionary radiation from an ancestral ocean-dwelling, single-celled organism (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/darwin-charles/">Darwin 1859</a>).</p>
<p class="p">Although the amount of biodiversity seems bewildering, there are curiously beautiful and consistent patterns in the way the abundance and diversity of species seems to be organized: there are many more species in habitats close to the equator than at the poles, suggesting that sunlight, day length, and available moisture are important in determining the number of species that can be supported at any location. Similarly, we tend to find more species on continents and larger oceanic islands than we do on smaller and more isolated oceanic islands (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/macarthur-robert-h-and-edward-o-wilson/">MacArthur and Wilson 1967</a>). Within any location there is always a mixture of a few abundant species and many rare species. This delights bird watchers and plant hunters, who ferociously seek to identify as many rare and uncommon species as possible. Yet, the relative abundance of plants, or birds, or insects, or bacteria at any location seems to follow an underlying statistical pattern that is remarkably consistent and almost predictable. If the numbers of individuals are plotted out as a frequency distribution, boxed into categories that sequentially represent a doubling of abundance, then the pattern is always very close to log-normal (the notorious bell curve), except with logarithmic classes of abundance along the x-axis. Ecologists have long been fascinated with the mechanisms that produce this pattern: once we know the number of species that occupy a region, then we can quickly ascertain their relative abundance (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/may-robert-m-se-3/">May 1975</a>). The most parsimonious explanation has been provided by Hubbell’s Neutral Theory of Biodiversity (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/hubbell-stephen-p-3/">Hubbell 2001</a>), which suggests that the observed patterns of relative abundance can be produced by a model that assumes all species are equal and have similar birth, death, and extinction rates (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/hubbell-stephen-p-se/">Hubbell 1997</a>). Yet biologists know that these assumptions cannot be correct, as different species tend to have different birth and death rates and actively compete with each other. So two of the greatest questions facing ecologists who are interested in diversity are (1) what determines the number of species that can coexist at a particular location? and (2) how does this factor interact with the birth, death, and extinction rates of neutral theory to create the consistently observed patterns of species abundance? Ultimately, we will also need to know whether the observed species abundance relationship creates resilience in the ways in which biodiversity contributes ecosystem services to the human economy.</p>
<p class="p">At any location, biodiversity is organized into a food web: the many plant species will be fed upon by slightly fewer species of herbivorous animals that can digest cellulose and other plant structural material. These in turn will be fed upon by even fewer predatory species. Throughout their lives, all these free-living species will be fed upon by a large diversity of parasitic species that slowly consume them from the inside out, rather than the outside in. These parasitic species may form between 40 and 90 percent of the species networked together within the food web at any location (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/dobson-andy-et-al/">Dobson et al. 2008</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/lafferty-kevin-et-al/">Lafferty et al. 2008</a>). There will also be a large diversity of “decomposer” species that digest individuals that have died, or consume the excretory products that live individuals discard. We have no good estimate of the abundance of decomposer species, but a simple thought experiment tells us that the world would be a much messier place in their absence. We are just beginning to understand the structure of food webs; mathematically, it is one of the deepest and most intractable problems in science and arguably one requiring the most urgent attention. Central to the complexity of this problem is that the mathematical structure of all food webs always becomes increasingly less stable as the number of interacting species increases (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/may-robert-m-se-4/">May 1974</a>). Mathematically, there have to be constraints on the intensity with which species interact with each other, constraints that interact with the geometrical structure of the web in ways that allow multiple species to interact, consume, compete, and coexist with each other. Ecologists have begun to identify some of these rules and geometries (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/mccann-kevin-s/">McCann 2011</a>). The current rates of extinction emphasize the urgency of fully understanding this problem before there are either no pristine webs left to study, or the reduction in vital services supplied to humans declines dramatically.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="pf">The popular understanding of culture in mid-twentieth-century America and Europe was arguably the symphony orchestra, the ballet, the art museum, and a “national” white, elite etiquette dictating, and explaining, how people should behave. Since the mid-1960s, we have witnessed the production and recognition of a proliferation of “cultures” and “multiculturalisms” within popular culture and informal political and economic institutions. Current usage is replete with compound cultures: counterculture; pop culture; office culture; indigenous culture; urban culture; peasant culture; global culture; “mainstream” culture; and “other-cultures.”</p>
<p class="p">The biological and agricultural roots of the word have also expanded, as illustrated by frequent references to “lab culture” (a living bacterial or fungal assemblage produced by humans in a laboratory); and living “micro-cultures” purposely fostered in yogurt, sourdough, tofu, and other living foods. The latter sense of the word is by no means irrelevant to the prior “social” sense; they are all about the terms of relationship among various elements in complex assemblages of humans, other beings, the Earth, and things. In contemporary vernacular understanding, culture is the ongoing collective sense making of how we <span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">be</span></span></span> in relation with each other, other living beings, and the living world, and may include everything from microbes to artificial intelligence, virtual worlds, and the “viral” phenomena that sweep across the worldwide web.</p>
<p class="p">In academic contexts, “culture” refers to a process, or a code of practice rooted in a shared understanding of the world(s). It can be an artifact, or a performance that simultaneously creates and conveys meaning through symbolic representations. Social scientists often define it as the behaviors and beliefs characteristic of a particular social or national group. Most natural scientists place culture outside their domain of species, spaces, patterns, and processes of the biophysical world, notwithstanding the convergence of social, biological, and physical categories in popular culture and in theoretical breakthroughs across disciplines (complexity, network theory).</p>
<p class="p"><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/williams-raymond-3/">Raymond Williams (1973)</a> noted that “culture” described persons, and whole peoples and their practices, whose civilized, aesthetic sensibilities and intellectual focus lifted them above the gritty physicality of farming, manufacturing, and artisanal work. The cultured person transcended nature, Earth, the body, and “animal instincts” through the life of the mind and the “fine arts,” reflecting class overtones and delineating clear boundaries between types of people (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/williams-raymond-se/">Williams 1976 [1983]</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/mitchell-don-2/">Mitchell 2004</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/yudice-george-2">Yudice 2007</a>). He cited the origins of the word in Europe as related to “cultivate,” meaning “to work with or upon nature,” a perspective that informed cultural-landscape and cultural-ecology approaches to the crafting of cultural landscapes and the appropriation of nature by humans (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/mitchell-thomas-w/">Mitchell 2000</a>). This framing of nature-culture connections was dualistic, hierarchical, nonreciprocal, and partial, yet asserted universality. Whether they celebrated or mourned the fact, scholars generally agreed that culture stood outside of nature, transforming it. Contemporary scholars have suggested that the rift between the humanities and sciences, described by C. P. Snow (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/williams-raymond-se/">1964 in Williams 1976 [1983])</a> as the “two cultures” phenomenon, as well as the current “culture wars” and “science wars,” all rest on a deeper shared assumption of active human cultures working upon the passive raw material of a separate and opposite nature (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/ingold-tim-se/">Ingold 2004</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/de-sousa-santos-boaventura-se-2/">de Sousa Santos 2010</a>).</p>
<p class="p">Three key points have emerged since Williams’s keyword essay that warrant special mention here. The first is the breakdown of the nature-culture binary by feminist, poststructuralist, and science and technology studies (STS) scholars. The second is the convergent development of network, complexity, and relationality theories in the social and natural sciences and in social movements. The third is the new wave of decolonial thought and action that derives from and supports cultures <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">of</span></span></span></em> resistance and culture <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">as</span></span></span></em> resistance in relation to power struggles over land/territory/ecologies and the nature of the world. We present each of these separately and a brief summary of their convergence in current theory and practice.</p>
<p class="p">Since the 1980s, feminist and poststructuralist theorists across disciplines have challenged the nature-culture binary and have called out the power relations inherent in this construct. Poststructural feminist questioning of culture and nature-culture binaries is best epitomized by three critiques of science and culture. <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/harding-sandra-2/">Sandra Harding (1986)</a> advanced a critique of scientific notions of objectivity, based on assumptions of rational scientific actors standing outside of culture, creating knowledge about nature. She proposed an epistemology of situated knowledge(s), taking into account the culturally embedded positionality of all knowers. <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/plumwood-val-se/">Val Plumwood (1993)</a> criticized the culture of science that purports to govern nature, and directly challenged the dualistic constructs that lie beneath the ecological crisis of reason. Building on <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/harding-sandra/?preview=true">Harding</a> and <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/strathern-marilyn-2/">Marilyn Strathern (1987)</a>, Donna Haraway (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/haraway-donna-se-5/">1988</a>, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/haraway-donna-se/">1991a</a>, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/haraway-donna-se-4/">1991b</a>, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/haraway-donna-se-2/">1994</a>, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/haraway-donna-se-6/">2007</a>) exhorted feminists to blur the lines separating human, animal, and machine, and to see and speak from an acknowledged, situated position with the “power of partial perspective” in the nature-culture borderlands that we all inhabit.</p>
<p class="p">With the exception of Plumwood, most ecofeminism critiques maintain elements of essentialized dualistic categories of nature and culture, identified with woman and man, although they criticize the ways in which these are deployed by powerful patriarchal institutions, including science, to the detriment of nature and women (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/merchant-carolyn-se/">Merchant 1989</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/shiva-vandana-se-3/">Shiva 1988 [1989]</a>). Marxist and socialist feminists have maintained dualistic constructs of humans and nature, focusing on the gendered distribution of labor and property, though several works have complicated the use of nature and culture and note how they often enable hegemonic political and economic power (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/katz-cindi/">Katz 1998</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/jackson-cecile/">Jackson 1993</a>.</p>
<p class="p">Feminist political ecology (FPE) scholars have countered the nature-culture binary through culturally and ecologically situated feminist critiques of science, sustainable development, and environmental injustices, in place and across places (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1374">Rocheleau, Thomas-Slayter, and Wangari 1996</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/rocheleau-dianne-e/">Rocheleau 2008</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/nightingale-andrea/">Nightingale 2006</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=974">Hawkins and Ojeda 2011</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/sundberg-juanita/">Sundberg 2004</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/harcourt-wendy/">Harcourt 2009</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/harcourt-wendy-and-arturo-escobar-eds/">Harcourt and Escobar 2005</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/escobar-arturo-se-4/">Escobar 2008</a>). Several works have moved beyond men and women, applying insights from feminist theory and practice to analyze the intersecting fields of power in specific contested ecologies (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/mollett-sharlene/">Mollett 2010</a>).</p>
<p class="p">Critical and poststructural nature-culture theorists across disciplines have also questioned nature-culture dualities on the basis of ethnographic research (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/nash-june-c/">Nash 2001</a>), archival and oral accounts of environmental history (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/braun-bruce-3">Braun 2008</a>), social constructivism (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/whatmore-sarah-se-2/">Whatmore 2006</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=675">Braun and Castree 1998</a>), and case studies of power in political ecologies. While much of the early work in political ecology left culture largely unexamined, feminist, poststructural, postcolonial, and decolonial political ecologies have embraced culture and challenged nature-culture dualisms (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1374">Rocheleau, Thomas-Slayter, and Wangari 1996</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=205">Blaser and Escobar</a>, this volume). Proponents of STS and actor network theory (ANT) have also explored the cultures of science and its social construction(s) of nature (see for instance <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/haraway-donna-se/">Haraway 1991a</a>, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=948">1991b</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/latour-bruno-se-3/">Latour 2005</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/law-john/">Law 1992</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1107">Law and Mol 2002</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/stengers-isabelle-se-2/">Stengers 2000</a>). Several ethnographic scholars have concluded that wild and domesticated are not fundamental and universal categories across all peoples, nor are nature and culture to be found always and everywhere (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/strathern-marilyn-2/">Strathern 1987</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=771">Croll and Parkin 1992</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=799">Descola and Palsson 1996</a>). Similarly, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1024">Tim Ingold (2011) </a>concludes that ways of life, of being, seeing, and doing, are not about fixed repertoires contained within symbolic systems of representation. He eschews culture and nature for “the dwelt-in-world,” which we know through immersion, encounter, process, sensibility, and becoming (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/ingold-tim-se-2/">Ingold 2000, 42</a>). He notes that what we call cultural transmission occurs by cultivating habits and possibilities of attention and of “being alive to the world” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/ingold-tim-se-2/">Ingold 2000, 2011</a>).</p>
<p class="p">What is made visible through these various polemics is the artificial separation of nature and culture by hegemonic, and often colonial, thought. What remains are some key questions about the different connections and relationships that make dwelling in the world possible. For instance, how are people connected to each other and to other beings/elements of the world? Social connections that have long been posited within social theory as hierarchical structures are increasingly characterized as “flat” social networks devoid of power. Labor-based understandings of human relationships to nature, in terms of raw material to be transformed, are giving way to metaphors of humans rooted in place(s). Visions of rhizomes, mushrooms, rooted networks, networked places, and relational territories are increasingly invoked to reconcile these dichotomous formulations with the complexities of the more-than-human world (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1586">Whatmore 2002</a>, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1585">2004</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1373">Rocheleau and Roth 2007</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=837">Escobar 2008</a>; Massey in <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=955">Harcourt et al. 2013</a>).</p>
<p class="p">The network, the web, and the rhizome are rapidly gaining over the tree as metaphor in the study of culture, nature, and technology. The transgression of the nature-culture binary requires a vision that does not see a focal, self-contained organism, human or otherwise, planted upon nature as substrate. Rhizomatic metaphors have become especially fashionable in social theory, as well as in technology studies and communications (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=795">Deleuze and Guattari 1987</a>). The humble mushroom is perhaps ideal for purposes of thinking about culture(s) and the relationships of humans to other beings, whether in the case of rooted social movements (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/rocheleau-dianne-and-robin-roth/">Rocheleau and Roth 2007</a>) or explicit associations of people and other species (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/tsing-anna/">Tsing 2012</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1372">Rocheleau 2015</a>). The actual organism, the thing called mushroom, is the living network below ground, and the thing we usually refer to as mushroom is only the fruiting body, which is an ephemeral “organ” of reproduction. It presents a visible expression that allows us to read the presence of the organism, though we then tend to conflate that fruiting body with the thing itself. That subterranean web of relations is what “powers” the ongoing development, performance, and result of visible, legible connections among humans, and among the Earth, humans, other beings, their artifacts, and their technologies—hence, culture.</p>
<p class="p">Rooted networks (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/rocheleau-dianne-and-robin-roth/">Rocheleau and Roth 2007</a>) bring the material into assemblages of actors, while recognizing the importance of place and the rooting of all networks (that include humans) in the Earth. All networks go to ground somewhere, even if that ground is dispersed and networked in a web of sources. There is a need to ground network and assemblage-based visions to accommodate actually existing and emergent nature-cultures (see also <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1024">Ingold 2011</a>). These range from indigenous peoples and farming communities in specific ancestral lands to the contingent territorial roots of pastoralists, agropastoralists, and urban nomads who are at home, on the move, over vast regional homelands. Likewise, this encompasses the various rhizomic modes of “rooting” in the emergent urban, rural, and regional nature-cultures of the pluriverse.</p>
<p class="p">“Pluriverse’’ has been invoked by many indigenous and decolonial thinkers, activists, and scholars to express the “coexistence of multiple interconnected worlds” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=835">Escobar 1995 [2011]</a>, viii). While the Western academy credits William James (see <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=850">Ferguson 2007</a>) with the concept, we suggest that he codified, rather than invented, a phenomenon already alive in many cultures across place and time. The dictionary provides a pluralistic definition of “universe,” though James’s “pluralism” went beyond the common usage today. It evokes a sense of coexistence, simultaneity, and copresent realities, going beyond multiple epistemologies to multiple ontologies. Writing about such a pluriverse, decolonial thinkers Arturo Escobar, Marisol de la Cadena, and Mario Blaser suggest that we are actually talking about modernism as a reduction, collapsing the pluriverse into a single world where real politics is impossible and what passes for politics polices culture, while a rationalist, modernist science polices nature. The attempted hegemony of modernist “economy” seeks to govern both. It is a world of the pluriverse denied, of many worlds occluded to serve the interests of an aspiring (but always incomplete) dominant power structure. This “mainstream” globalized culture is built on one lie of universality, a second lie of invented and enforced duality between Nature and Culture, and a third lie of multiple domesticated versions of culture(s) as proof of difference to deflect recognition of (attempted) hegemony as well as the real diversity of multiple worlds.</p>
<p class="p">Pluriversal thinking stands in opposition to Euro/capitalocentric constructs that reify difference and mask hegemony. It also contrasts with denials of difference such as those by <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=967">David Harvey (1990)</a>, encapsulated by <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1235">Don Mitchell (1995, 111) </a>as “‘[c]ulture’ makes ‘others.’ ‘Others’ do not make ‘culture.’” Instead, the inversion of that same “othering” gaze has repeatedly made visible, and politically powerful, the multiple and overlapping cultures, including oppressed and oppositional groups within “the West” and globally, among “the rest” (Hall 1992). The reemergence of decolonial thought and practice and the rise of explicit cultures<em> <span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">of</span></span></span></em> resistance/culture(s) <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">as</span></span></span></em> resistance (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1624">Yudice 2007</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1270">Nash 2001</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/simpson-leanne/">Simpson 2011</a>) has roots in the work of <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=844">Franz Fanon (1963)</a>, as well as in several waves of “Third World” and other liberation struggles throughout the world and the United States, including the Black Power movement, the American Indian Movement (AIM), and Chicano/Latino movements. Nationalist and identity-based politics of liberation derived in part from shared cultures of resistance and to some extent from cultures as resistance, though the language invoked peoples, races, and classes, in relation to land and freedom, rather than nature-cultures in more-than-human worlds.</p>
<p class="p">New social movements, scholars, artists, and activists have brought decolonial, indigenous, and subaltern thinking into the emergence of a new liberation culture and politics, based on “decolonizing knowledge and reinventing power” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1471">de Sousa Santos 2010</a>; <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1003">Hopkinson 1998</a>, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1004">2000</a>, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1005">2012</a>), much of it linked to Earth, land, territory, and the more-than-human world. These demonstrate that “others” <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">do</span></span></span></em> make cultures, and choose to defend certain ways of being, in many (but not all) cases against capital, empires, authoritarian/totalitarian states, and other repressive patriarchies. La Via Campesina makes culture(s) and knowledge(s), along with the World Social Forum, the Zapatistas, the Indignados, Occupy, and a profusion of indigenous movements worldwide. While violent racial supremacists, militant patriarchal religious movements, and international corporations also make cultures, the presence and practices of liberatory social movements clearly demonstrate that cultures do not, of necessity, emanate from coercive power. They can also be powerful agents and advocates of emerging nature-cultures based on principles of social justice and ecological viability.</p>
<p class="p">As Arturo Escobar notes, “Culture is political because meanings are constitutive of processes that, implicitly or explicitly, seek to redefine social power. When movements deploy alternative conceptions of woman, nature, development, economy, democracy, or citizenship that unsettle dominant cultural meanings, they enact a cultural politics” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=838">Escobar 1998, 64</a>). In fact, to some indigenous scholars like <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=998">Brendan Hokowhitu (2009)</a>, such a cultural politics is enacted on and by indigenous bodies serving as sites of resistance. Various indigenous movements, too, conceptualize culture as the enactment of a radical politics of change. The “Idle No More” movement, in Canada, to protect lands and waters against tar sand extraction and mining is a contemporary decolonial indigenous movement that sees culture as political, and cultural practice as the enactment of political thought. For scholar-activists like Leanne Simpson, the revisioning of political thought from an indigenous way of being-in-relation-in-the-world implies a continual struggle against a culture of extraction, and for a creative culture of “continuous rebirth” (cited in <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1070">Klein 2013</a>). Here, a decolonial feminist understanding of culture emphasizes not only a reintegration of nature and culture but the decoupling of modernist and colonial interpretations of culture from its actual enactment as a site of political struggle to legitimate different ontologies/epistemologies of being in the world.</p>
<p class="p">The reemergence of decolonial thinking is converging with other radical currents that question basic categories of knowledge and language as deeply steeped in Eurocentric, racist, sexist, classist, and heteronormative binaries, hierarchical assumptions, and patriarchal values and practices. Decolonial theorists are in conversation with pluriverse and feminist thinkers, and are coalescing with resurgent indigenous and alternative movements, under the umbrellas of world anthropology, decolonial theory, indigenous theories of liberation, and alter-globalization. Together, they treat nature-cultures as particular responses to colonial acts, on the one hand, and as existing also within acolonial space-times, on the other. The decolonial turn validates both the precolonial existence of multiple nature-cultures and the possibilities that particular existing nature-cultures provide for decolonization. Building on these decolonial visions, we see culture as the habit-forming practices and politics of connection and disconnection that shape, and are shaped by, the dynamic experiences of being-in-relation-in-the-world(s).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The twenty-first-century planetary challenge orbits around three integrated Earth system trends—species extinction and threats to biodiversity, rapidly changing biospheric circulations, and altered biogeochemical cycles. These patterns are the template for the proliferation of natural resource extraction, accelerating consumer demand, and the challenges of global wealth distribution. Meanwhile, the extraordinary synergistic advances of global communications networks, computerization, miniaturization, and instrumentation provide humanity with the daunting prospect of simultaneously exacerbating these challenges while offering the means to solve them.</p>
<p>Since the late 1960s, and to some extent before then, environmental education has taken on this challenge, assuming that by expanding awareness of ecological relationships, natural history, and the human impact on natural systems, it would better equip people to perceive, understand, and manage these issues. Implicit in this assumption is the sense of grandeur and wonder that accompanies this awareness. With greater appreciation of the magnificence of the biosphere, people would be more inclined to protect and preserve what they have grown to love. Deeper awareness motivates ecological citizenship. The holy grail of traditional environmental education is formulating a robust ethic of care. Its great conceit (or naïveté) suggests that if they (those we educate) only knew what we know, they would act as we do. I have been privy to hundreds of academic and practitioner conversations that embody this attitude. Indeed, it is the foundation of hope that lies at the core of education and teaching.</p>
<p>Environmental education wanders through a wide assortment of ideas, approaches, and methods to implement this implicit mandate. Allow me to trace some of these connecting paths, which are all interested, in some measure, in how people think and learn about their relationship to the natural world. Hence they collectively comprise whatever we mean by “environmental education.” Conservation psychology aspires to understand human behavior and motivations while applying its research to the practice of conservation biology. Place-based education and bioregionalism intend to build affiliation with local habitats and community. Natural history promotes familiarity, understanding, and identification of flora and fauna. The Wilderness Excursion promotes the virtues of outdoor expeditions. Urban ecology emphasizes understanding of the city as a complex ecosystem. The environmental arts and humanities engage diverse milieus to promote voice and imagination—the nature essay and poem, performance arts, acoustic ecology. Environmental justice links ecological challenges to issues of equity, gender, race, and diversity. Environmental ethics contemplates the virtues of ecological behaviors for individuals and communities. Spiritual ecology investigates how the world’s wisdom traditions might incorporate ecological knowledge. Sustainability science studies how to minimize the human ecological footprint. There are literally dozens of fields of environmentally related inquiry—from green business to theories of the commons, from phenomenology to environmental security—that are relevant for environmental education. Most importantly, these approaches are implicitly concerned with how people apprehend the relationship between humanity and the biosphere.</p>
<p>This education agenda holds true for environmental organizations. Almost every regional and global environmental organization, from the Wildlife Conservation Society to Worldwatch to your local watershed association, considers the educational implications and applications of its work. Environmental education is a prominent concern for just about anyone who thinks about ecological issues—academics, practitioners, and concerned citizens alike.</p>
<p>There is a new trend that greatly impacts the theory and practice of environmental education—the proliferation of academic programs, organizations, businesses, and scholarship emphasizing sustainability. The practice of sustainability builds on the environmental education approaches described above. However, it brings many new emphases, stressing the built environment, especially energy, food, and water, and calling attention to how and whether organizations implement sustainability initiatives. Fields such as architecture, landscape design, planning, organizational behavior, finance and investment, and social entrepreneurship now have “green” orientations that also share educational missions. Sustainability studies contributes to an increasingly robust environmental education portfolio.</p>
<p>If environmental education is prevalent in all of these domains, what makes it distinctive as a field of study unto itself? What compelling synergy results from the combination of these words? Education connotes an emphasis on the teaching and learning process. The environmental prefix suggests that we are mainly concerned with teaching and learning processes that cultivate a deeper awareness about ecological processes and the biosphere. Ultimately, environmental educators are concerned with three curricular questions. What are the primary subjects of study? What are the most effective learning processes for teaching those subjects? How can those principles and processes be applied to real-world situations? In the remainder of this essay, I will present my view on these questions, but with an additional tweak. Given the planetary challenge described above, what is the foundation of a core environmental education curriculum? My suggestions are mainly organized for the college curriculum, although they can be readily adapted for a range of educational venues as developmentally appropriate.</p>
<p>I propose four broad categories as a curricular foundation—biosphere studies, social networking and change management, the creative imagination, and sustainability life skills. These are mutually reinforcing and reciprocal categories. They correspond with the classic formulation of natural and physical science, social science, the humanities, and professional practice. However, they are reconstructed to emphasize environmental education for the twenty-first-century learner. This formulation is derived from the tradition of approaches listed previously in the essay, and then synthesized and remixed for a contemporary perspective. For each foundation, I’ll briefly present a core learning process, distinguish a personal and public dimension, and then suggest some areas for substantive inquiry and experimentation. These are intended as ways of stimulating discussion, controversy, and imagination for an environmental education curricular agenda. Consider them as a suite of emerging curricular design potentials, rather than a blueprint or manifesto.</p>
<p>Biosphere studies emphasizes an understanding of scale, learning how to interpret spatial and temporal variability, as informed by the dynamics of ecosystem processes and local ecological observations. The challenge is to develop a conceptual sequence that helps students perceive, recognize, classify, detect, and interpret biospheric patterns, what I’ll describe as “pattern-based environmental learning.” The purpose is for students to better understand and internalize global environmental change. The personal dimension involves the development of natural history observation skills so as to enhance appreciation of home and habitat. The public dimension involves how to contribute those observations and assessments to global networks of biospheric data collection. Examples for study may include biogeochemical cycles, atmospheric and oceanic circulations, evolutionary ecology, restoration ecology, watersheds and fluvial geomorphology, biogeographical change (species migrations, radiations, and convergences), plate tectonics, and climate change.</p>
<p>The field of social networking and change management describes how to enhance, cultivate, and utilize social capital. This includes a personal dimension—providing students with the ability to better understand how they learn and think, how they respond to stress, and how to maximize psychological and physical wellness. The public dimension promotes the ability to interpret collective behavior in organizational settings. The learning process involves how to integrate the personal and social dimension so as to maximize human flourishing in diverse institutional settings. Examples for study include cognitive theory, neuropsychology, organizational process, theories of social change, behavioral economics, ecological economics, social entrepreneurship, decision-making science, adaptive management, and networking theory.</p>
<p>The creative imagination entails the cultivation of an aesthetic voice, personal expression, and improvisational excellence to enhance the arts, music, dance, play, literary narrative, and philosophical inquiry. The personal dimension emphasizes how to use the creative process as a means to explore questions of ethics, meaning, and purpose, how to maximize aesthetic joy, and how to express emotional responses to challenging environmental issues. The public dimension develops the capacity for collective expression in social milieus—how to use public spaces such as buildings, parks, campuses, etc., to promote learning about sustainability and environmental issues. Examples for study include environmental art and music, acoustic ecology and sound design, biophilic design and architecture, environmental interpretation, environmental perception, environmental ethics, ecological identity, the aesthetics and epistemology of patterns, game design, information design, and biomimicry.</p>
<p>Sustainability life skills is the application of sustainability principles to the routines, behaviors, and practices of everyday life. The personal dimension involves the individual behaviors of sustenance, shelter, transportation, health, and domestic life. Further, it emphasizes how to incorporate sustainability principles into one’s career and professional choices. The public dimension involves how to support organizational or regional sustainability efforts, including procurement, ecological cost accounting, recycling, health services, and/or other forms of community capacity building for sustainability. Examples for study include organic agriculture, nutrition, home building and engineering, construction, alternative energy, energy and water conservation, alternative transportation, sustainability metrics, habitat restoration, gardening, urban and regional planning, career development, reflective practice, and service learning.</p>
<p>For environmental education to be pertinent, enhancing, evocative, and ubiquitous, it has to continuously emphasize the importance of understanding the biosphere, but to do so in ways that correspond to how people learn, and finally to how they apply what they learn. The great new frontier in education is how brain research, evolutionary processes, and cognitive psychology inform perception and behavior. This has extraordinary implications for facilitating learning and teaching about the biosphere, and will be crucial for developing the skills and awareness necessary for the forthcoming decades—adaptation, resilience, versatility, anticipation, open-mindedness, self-reflectiveness, and clarity. The ultimate challenge for environmental education is posed with this question: how can humans come to recognize that they are the biosphere and their ecological behaviors and actions have significance for both human flourishing and the future of life on Earth?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="pf">The first decade of the twenty-first century has been marked by several environmental disasters and debates about global climate change, which have compelled academics, policy makers, and grassroots organizations to reexamine the relationship between environment and development. But what exactly do these varied stakeholders mean when they use the term “environment”? For students and specialists alike, “environment” carries as much of a “complex and contradictory symbolic load” as “nature” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1468">Soper 1995, 2</a>). An overview of the etymology of “environment” brings some clarity and is a useful place to start if we are to understand the contrary ideologies and symbolic load the term carries.</p>
<p class="p">The<em> <span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Oxford English Dictionary</span></span></span></em> (<em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;"><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=831">OED</a></span></span></span></em>) traces “environment” to the word “environs,” from Middle French. Ironically, in contrast to twentieth- and twenty-first-century perceptions of environment as wide open natural spaces, early moderns understood “environment” as a noun—“the state of being encompassed or surrounded”—or a verb—“the action of circumnavigating, encompassing, or surrounding something.” By the eighteenth century, “environment” designated “the area surrounding a place or thing.” Not until the twentieth century did the term “environment” come to represent the natural world, but even then “environment” also designated physical surroundings “as affected by human activity.” It is difficult to ignore the close proximity of the <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">OED</span></span></span></em> definitions of environment to the etymology of the terms “colony” and “colonial”—or the Latin “<em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">colōnia</span></span></span></em>”—a public settlement of a newly conquered country, “the planting of settlements.” Both “environment” and “colony” invoke a sense of enclosure, of space cordoned off by human activity. How might our understanding of “environment” and “the tragedy of the commons” be altered if we place the closing of the commons within the context of colonial settlement, as well as industrialization? Although the concept of common pasture lands and their enclosure dates to medieval land tenure systems, the term “the tragedy of the commons” is attributed to a <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=959">1968 <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Science</span></span></span></em> article by Garrett Hardin</a>, who argued that overgrazing will eventually deplete the commons unless its use is regulated by a private party or government. As a practical matter, the enclosure movement limiting open access to the commons resulted in the privatization of public space. What happens, for example, if we think of the tragedy of the commons in terms of Indian removal and the creation of the vast reservation system in the United States, reserves in Canada, or cotton plantations in the southern United States, sugar plantations in the Caribbean and Brazil, or tea plantations and poppy fields in India under the British raj? If we rethink environment as a history of enclosures, then we must also think about enclosures at the scale of the body.</p>
<p class="p">In its broadest sense, the term “environment” connotes contested terrains located at the intersection of economic, political, social, cultural, and sexual ecologies. Scholars of postcolonial studies, indigenous studies, and globalism, as well as environmental activists from the Global South, point out that ideas about the relationship among culture, environment, and development are bound up with colonial ideologies of race, civilization, and progress. Until the last two decades of the twentieth century, the environmental perceptions of the poor, working-class, and marginalized minorities were not the subject of sociological or anthropological studies in the Global North or the Global South. Although environmental justice activism and research in North America, Latin America, and South Africa, “environmentalism of the poor” in South Asia, green movements in Africa, and “landless peasant movements” in Latin America are receiving greater scholarly attention, to a large extent, perceptions of the environment in the Global North have been shaped by a small group of writers with access to publishers of works of literature. As a consequence, nature writing in North America and Europe, influenced by the Romantics, has been associated with leisure activities, escapes from the world of work and interactions with other human beings. Moreover, American and English poets and novelists, when gazing east, frequently exoticized the “Orient” as a “natural” reservoir for their spiritual longings. Although mountains, rivers, and other waterways may hold religious significance for indigenous peoples, conservation politics (embedded in colonial and imperial expansionist regimes) are often inspired by interpretations of particular places and peoples as virgin territory, untouched by human hands, urbanization, and technological revolution. This sentimentalization of nature perpetuates the nature-culture dualism inherited from European and North American Romanticism, a response to industrialization in the Global North. The challenge of modern environmentalists, or “contemporary new world pastoralists,” as Lawrence Buell puts it, is one of decolonization (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=690">1995, 55</a>). How does one think through the “natural” environment without becoming entangled in the symbolic load of nature, or of nature-culture dualisms?</p>
<p class="p">A focus on decolonization returns us to an understanding of “environment” as the enclosure of bodies of land, water, people, plants, and nonhuman animals in a colonial logic to exploit and appropriate biodiversity and indigenous knowledge. Vandana Shiva, physicist and India’s foremost environmental writer and activist, identifies the privatization of water and the plunder of seeds and indigenous knowledge through the use of intellectual-property legal conventions as only the most recent form that enclosures have taken. “Patents on life,” Shiva argues, “enclose the creativity inherent in living systems that reproduce and multiply in self-organized freedom. They enclose the interior spaces of the bodies of human beings, plants, and nonhuman animals. They also enclose the free spaces of intellectual creativity by transforming publicly generated knowledge into private property” <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1442">(1997, 7)</a>. In articulating a concept of “living systems that reproduce and multiply in self-organized freedom,” Shiva invokes an understanding of ecology that opposes itself to the imagined closed space of environment. “Biodiversity has been protected through the flourishing of cultural diversity,” Shiva insists, citing the example of neem, <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Azarichita indica</span></span></span></em>, a tree native to India and used for centuries as a biopesticide and a medicine, which has been patented by four companies owned by a U.S. multinational corporation <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1442">(1997, 72, 69–71)</a>. This privatization (enclosure) is both a threat to biodiversity and an appropriation of indigenous environments and knowledge. Ecological economist Joan Martinez-Alier agrees, pointing out that chemical compounds, “such as morphine and quinine, [which] were originally discovered through their use by indigenous cultures,” are just a few examples of the debt the North owes to the South (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1182">2000, 62</a>). Martinez-Alier argues that the “main enemy of environmental justice in South Africa remains the globalized economy plus a local ideology which still sees the environment in terms of wilderness more than human livelihood despite the competent efforts of a very large group of activists and intellectuals who show in practice that environmental justice may become one main force for sustainability” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1183">2003, 59</a>). In her articulation of ecology as living systems inclusive of human knowledge, Shiva bridges the chasm between principles of deep ecology and environmental justice that have arisen in South Africa, which shares more ideologically with the settler colonies of North America than it does with India.</p>
<p class="p">The <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">OED</span></span></span></em> offers a second definition of “environment,” dating to the mid-nineteenth century, which comes closer to late-twentieth-century understandings of ecology. In the English language, environment as “the physical surroundings or conditions in which a person or other organism lives, develops, etc., or in which a thing exists; the external conditions in general affecting the life, existence, or properties of an organism or object,” moves beyond anthropocentric or human-centered approaches; nevertheless, the retention of the term “surroundings” continues to connote enclosures or cordoned-off places rather than the more fluid concept of interdependent and interrelational ecological systems. Deep ecology or biocentric understandings of the environment arose out of a strand in the wilderness movement in American environmental thought and ecological movements in Norway. In the United States, deep ecology traces its roots to Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) and John Muir (1838–1914). If for Thoreau preservation of wild nature is important for the preservation of civilization, even though his idea of the wild is pastoral, a middle ground between the encroaching cities and the savagery of the “wilderness” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=690">Buell 1995, 54</a>), for nineteenth-century ecologist John Muir, “nature has an intrinsic value and consequently possesses at least the right to exist” independent of the needs of civilization (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1316">Payne 1996, 5</a>). Although Muir is credited with developing the idea of the interconnection of ecosystems for American ecologists, his ecosystems are purified through the occlusion of human inhabitants. And while the Norwegian Arné Naess’s platform for deep ecology affirms that “the richness and diversity of life forms on earth, including forms of human cultures, have intrinsic worth,” his support for “a substantially smaller human population” is controversial in marginalized communities, which have overall higher mortality rates and consume less of the world’s resources than affluent northern nations (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1387">Rothenberg 1993, 127–28</a>). Critics of Naess’s biospheric egalitarianism, which seeks to place humans on an equal footing with other species, point out structural inequality and inequity within the greater human community. Environmental justice scholars and activists charge that deep ecologists—who reject anthropocentric or human-centered understandings of the environment—ignore social and economic inequality in both northern communities and the Global South (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=930">Guha 2000, 85</a>).</p>
<p class="p">Notwithstanding large and growing urban populations and the transformation of rural environments by agribusiness, mainstream environmentalism, by focusing exclusively on preserving “pristine wilderness” areas visited by those with leisure time and neglecting the environments and economic needs of workers, has long been vulnerable to charges of elitism. Although early-twentieth-century writers like Theodore Dreiser (1871–1945) chronicled the toxic environments faced by poor immigrant workers (Swedes, Poles, Hungarians, and Lithuanians) in an oil refinery in New Jersey, the urgency of industrial environmental problems did not transform environmental discourse in the United States. In short, green environments were subjects of environmental activism, while toxic brown environments became the purview of labor movements and occupational safety experts. It was not until the late twentieth century that the environmental justice movement linked issues of environmental equity with issues of social and racial justice. Environmental justice activists and scholars point out that the anti-urban bias of preservation politics has often resulted in the creation of toxic ghettoes in cities while scenic wonderlands have been cordoned off (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=562">Adamson, Evans, and Stein 2002</a>). While the environmental justice movement has been influenced by Rachel Carson’s (1907–1964) investigation of the relationship between the use of DDT and other pesticides and the health of human and bird populations in <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Silent Spring</span></span></span></em>, few are aware of César Chávez’s (1927–1993) struggles (as leader of the United Farm Workers) to end the spraying of banded pesticides over California fields where migrant farm workers toiled, grew sick, and died. The unequal enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, along with the creation of toxic wastelands in minority communities, raises issues of environmental equity. As sociologist Robert D. Bullard points out, “all communities are not created equal. Some are more equal than others” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=696">2002, 90</a>). “Environmental racism,” Bullard argues, refers to “any policy, practice, or directive that differentially affects or disadvantages (whether intended or unintended) individuals, groups, or communities based on race or color” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=696">2002, 90–91</a>). In his research, Bullard investigates the ways in which seemingly innocuous municipal policy decisions such as where to locate municipal bus terminals have broad environmental justice implications for racialized communities often formed as a result of past restrictive housing and lending policies and practices. Environmental justice researchers and scholars point out that the exploitation of the environment and the exploitation of people are inextricably linked. Finally, a consideration of social, cultural, and sexual ecologies encourages investigations of the differing ways in which “culture may be said to ‘work’ upon nature” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1468">Soper 1995, 135</a>). Bodies do not simply exist as finished products, but are complex ecologies continuously in the making. Their overdetermination as natural ignores the ideological naturalization of what is socially and culturally construed (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1468">136</a>).</p>
<p class="p">If, as Bill McKibben asserts in his introduction to the Library of America anthology <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">American Earth: Environmental Writing since Thoreau</span></span></span></em>, “environmentalism can no longer confine itself to the narrow sphere it has long inhabited” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1207">2009, xxx</a>), then environmental scholarship and movements must return to the broader meaning of the term “environment.” “If it isn’t as much about economics, sociology, and pop culture as it is about trees, mountains, and animals,” McKibben continues, “it won’t in the end matter” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1207">2009, xxx</a>). The future of the environment depends on the dissolution of the border zones between the environmental idealism of naturalism and the passion for environmental justice. At the grassroots level, community organizers in New Orleans have begun to engage with organizers in the Maldives, and Canadian university students participate in exchanges and dialogues with their counterparts in South Asia. But they are not encouraged by decisions made by those at the highest echelon of power in both the North and the South, where governments continue to treat environments as if they are enclosed “surroundings” rather than complex interlinked ecological systems.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="pf">Our understanding of the environment is first and foremost informed by our experience of place—the geographic location where we live, work, and interact with nature and people. Our identity, culture, history, and politics are bound up in a sense of place. Though intuitively place may seem inherently conservative, a reading of place as a site of progressive politics allows us to understand more concretely how environment is linked to culture through relations of power, agency, and responsibility to human and nonhuman environments (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=953">Harcourt and Escobar 2005</a>).</p>
<p class="p">My reading of place follows Doreen Massey’s definition of place as inevitably inflected by the global (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1187">Massey 2002,</a> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1188">2004</a>). Understanding place as “a meeting-place” enables us to theorize place as within networks of relations and forms of power that stretch beyond specific places. I explore place with reference to my own engagement in place as a feminist political ecologist (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=951">Harcourt 2009</a>), looking at three stories of struggles, networking, and connections around place at the local, national, and global level.</p>
<p class="p">Bolsena, the place from where I write, is a tiny town in north Lazio, Italy, a small Etruscan town on the shores of a volcanic lake founded over two millennia ago. The politics of place is currently being shaped by burgeoning tourism, failing agriculture, and the vested interests of the local church, government, and business. Here environment and culture intersect as Bolsena, only recently made up of poor fishing settlements, a castle, and pilgrims, is now subject to modern life marked by overfishing, tourism, speed boats, and the influx of waste from agricultural chemicals being used in the hills surrounding the lake. The national authorities have declared the water unsafe to drink and citizens now pay for filtered water collected at a central dispensary in the town. Local community groups hold town hall meetings to lobby national or European authorities to provide pump filters to clean the lake, set up eco-islands around the town, promote biological farming, and control the use of speed boats. The emphasis is on care for the peace and beauty of the lake alongside the culture—the Etruscan and Roman histories, pottery, local wine, and food. This understanding of place and the responsibility of nature intertwined with culture is in contrast to the business lobby that wants to promote Bolsena for its boating and fishing, tourism, resurrected medieval religious festivities, and popular musical evenings.</p>
<p class="p">Negotiating around who decides what happens in Bolsena is a continual struggle among the town hall, governmental committees, the church, and progressive environmental groups. It is mostly women who have been leading the progressive environmental groups. They are the local women who are running the book and coffee shops, “eco” wine bars, and “bio” cheese farms and holding workshops on local food and Etruscan cultures. Defending the environmental and cultural integrity of the Lake of Bolsena in order to ensure the sustainability of the environs has become a daily activity. The current austerity measures imposed by the Italian state government since 2012 have heightened the struggle around the town’s economic and ecological survival. The local protests are usually ignored by the mayor, who puts economic benefits from tourist fishing competitions, lake-side caravan parks, and hotels ahead of the polluting impacts of such activities on the lake.</p>
<p class="p">The struggles between progressive and business interests in Bolsena show how place is not static but is shaped by the changing experiences of the people living in the place as they connect to other flows of information, economic activities, and social forces (be they tourism, feminism, or religion).</p>
<p class="p">Australia, my birthplace, has in the last years seen a proliferation of progressive narratives around place, environment, and identity. These narratives recognize the violence of colonial history; acknowledge the complexity of forty-five thousand years of indigenous cultures, divergent understandings of land, time, and spirituality; and attempts to deal with the overexploitation of waters, minerals, and soils. Such narratives counter the vision of Australia as a place of great empty spaces and blue skies, a lucky country that offered Europeans wealth and prosperity to be yielded from its mineral wealth and what they considered to be “unpeopled” land.</p>
<p class="p">Since the 1990s, the racial political landscape in Australia has been transformed through various legal and federal decisions related to land rights, equity, and justice: the 1992 Native Titles Act gave back land to traditional owners along with the renunciation of the term “<span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">terra nullius</span></span></span>”; the 1994 national “Going Home Conference” recognized the aboriginal children, “the stolen generation,” who had been forcibly removed from their families; and the 1996 apology campaign led to the annual “Sorry Day” (held every May 26 since 1996 in memory of the stolen generation). The most famous symbol of central Australia, Ayers Rock, was renamed “Uluru” and officially returned in 1993. In 2000, indigenous Australian and gold medal Olympic athlete Cathy Freeman, with her vivid smile and arm tattoo saying “cos I’m free,” became the heroine of all Australians in the 2000 Olympic Games, celebrating her four-hundred-meter victory by waving an aboriginal land rights flag along with an Australian one (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=952">Harcourt 2001, 197–98</a>).</p>
<p class="p">This reclaiming of identities and reconciliation of white and black Australia illustrates how place can be renegotiated. Taking responsibility for creating new understandings of place, is not easy. A sense of belonging in Australia is wrought with an inherent racism of the poverty, ill health, drink, drugs, and violence that indigenous peoples experience. While other Australians can also suffer poverty, the high levels of child and maternal mortality among indigenous Australians in particular belie the First World status of Australia.</p>
<p class="p">It is challenging for Australians to take responsibility and make connections across the racial and cultural differences. Anglo-Celtic Australian Peter Read (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1352">2000</a>), in writing about place in Australia, confronts the racism of rural Anglo-Celtic Australians. He speaks of how the contestation between different understandings of place among indigenous and other Australians—one rich with spiritual meaning and a profound sense of collective living together with the land, contrasting with the predominantly capitalist drive to create individual wealth through the ownership and exploitation of land and its resources—needs to be articulated in order for a new sense of Australia to emerge. Such a new understanding would acknowledge and combine different cultural understandings of place, acknowledge the profound power imbalances, and provide a basis for learning to care for the land materially and spiritually.</p>
<p class="p">Places, such as Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, also exist at global levels. In UN and international-development-speak, “Rio” has become a symbolic place for modern “eco-governmentality” or the creation of the environment as a subject of global public discourse around “sustainable” development. The Earth Summit held in 1992 was not only about reframing public policy to be based on stewardship and resource management, but also about creating the first global meeting place of thousands of individuals campaigning on forestry, water, environmental justice, peace, and human rights. The NGO Global Forum in Flamengo Park, Rio, hosted hundreds of tents where civil society passionately engaged with Agenda 21 (the official outcome document). During the Global Forum, ecologists, the peace movement, trade unions, women’s and youth organizations, development NGOs, and local community groups intermingled, creating a collective vision for global environmental justice (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=784">Dankelman 2012</a>).</p>
<p class="p">This creation of “alternative” places where advocates, NGOs, and movement people could meet alongside the official negotiations has continued through the last twenty years in peoples’ struggle to defend the environment and the culture of local places in public global fora. Rio and its prototypes are highly negotiated places that have helped build connections, understanding, and knowledge among communities defending place, moving beyond the local and national space, shaping a global environmental movement. These places of progressive global negotiations (for example, the UN NGOs Forums held in the early 1990s, the protests held in 1999 in Seattle against the World Trade Organization) have emerged as historic moments flowing onto other places. These created places for movement engagement are illustrations of Massey’s “meeting-place” forging networks of relations and forms of power that stretch beyond specific places. I would argue that for all the cynicism around engaging in such global shows, these places have been key nodes for networking that strengthens local power in ways that extend and transform place-based politics and connections. These places are holding a sense of global responsibilities for exploitation of environments and culture. In places like Bolsena, the global forums strengthen the ecological organizations, connecting what is happening in the microcosm world of the lake with the larger movement. Utilizing social media, the forum debates create new forms of learning that politicize beyond the mainstream policy hype. These global places have played an important role in our global imaginary of the environment that can be politicized as something to be defended, creating a culture of translocal defense of place in vibrant global networks of connectivity (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=837">Escobar 2008</a>).</p>
<p class="p">These three examples illustrate that places, whether experienced at local, national, or global levels, are not natural, nor fixed. Our experience of place flows across spatial scales from the body to the household to the community, national, and global levels. Place extends beyond the physical. People negotiate place as they protect and conserve places, enhance and modify places, create connections with other places at different levels. Our attachments to place are about social, spiritual, and cultural meaning and identity as well as economic need. Political negotiations over the environmental and cultural issues informing place are part of our lived “glocal” realities (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=810">Dirlik 1998</a>).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="pf">The term “queer ecology” refers to a loose, interdisciplinary constellation of practices that aim, in different ways, to disrupt prevailing heterosexist discursive and institutional articulations of sexuality and nature, and also to reimagine evolutionary processes, ecological interactions, and environmental politics in light of queer theory. Drawing from traditions as diverse as evolutionary biology, LGBTTIQQ2SA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transsexual, intersex, queer, questioning, two-spirited, and allies) movements, and queer geography and history, feminist science studies, ecofeminism, and environmental justice, queer ecology currently highlights the complexity of contemporary biopolitics, draws important connections between the material and cultural dimensions of environmental issues, and insists on an articulatory practice in which sex and nature are understood in light of multiple trajectories of power and matter.</p>
<p class="p">In <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">The History of Sexuality</span></span></span></em>, Michel Foucault lays the groundwork for much contemporary queer ecological scholarship in his observation that, beginning in the nineteenth century, modern regimes of biopower came to conceive of sex as a specific object of scientific knowledge, organized through, on the one hand, a “biology of reproduction” that considered human sexual behavior in relation to the physiologies of plant and animal reproduction, and on the other, a “medicine of sex” that conceived of human sexuality in terms of desire and identity (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=864">1978, 54</a>). Although Foucault rightly notes the tenuous early connections between the two discourses, the establishment of sex as a matter of biopolitical <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">truth</span></span></span></em> could not help but be connected to ideas of nature, and especially to racialized, sexualized, and other anxieties over hygiene and degeneracy. In this context, the figure of the homosexual came to haunt the margins of emerging discourses in urban development, environmental health, and even wilderness preservation: the effeminate homosexual and the lesbian gender invert were not only seen increasingly as <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">against nature</span></span></span></em> but also sometimes considered symptoms of the toxic underside of industrial, urban, and increasingly cosmopolitan modernity.</p>
<p class="p">In this context, a prehistory of queer ecology must include the attempts of such authors as André Gide and Radclyffe Hall to turn these discourses on their heads (famously, of course, Oscar Wilde <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">embraced</span></span></span></em> his position “against” nature). Specifically, the placement of sexual desire and orientation in the purview of evolutionary concern gave rise not only to the articulation of homosexuality with degeneracy but also to the possibility that a variety of sexual practices and identities could be understood as “natural” and, therefore, morally neutral; indeed, early sexologist Havelock Ellis wrote, in 1905, that “one might be tempted to expect that homosexual practices would be encouraged whenever it was necessary to keep down the population” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=830">9</a>). Drawing on the rich historical inclusion of same-sex (male) eroticism in pastoral literatures, Gide’s <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Corydon</span></span></span></em> (published in four parts from 1911 to 1920) thus pursued the idea that the homosexual activities of boy-shepherds represented a more authentic and innocent sexuality than the heterosexual conventions they needed to learn in order to enter into adult relations of (enforced) heterosexuality (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1450">Shuttleton 2000</a>). Similarly, Hall’s <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Well of Loneliness</span></span></span></em> (1928) painted a tragic portrait of a lesbian gender invert who was, if anything, by nature nobler and <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">more</span></span></span></em> moral than any of the other characters in the book (a portrayal that caused the book to be banned in Britain, see <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1251">Mortimer-Sandilands 2008b</a>). Although both texts were thoroughly steeped in the class, racialized, and gender politics of the era and are problematic for a host of reasons associated with neopastoral literatures more broadly (<em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Corydon</span></span></span></em> is deeply misogynist; <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">The Well</span></span></span></em> is profoundly nationalist; both deploy nature as an agent of conservatism), they and others played an important role in setting the conceptual stage for more recent attempts to queer nature and ecology. Indeed, despite their considerable political differences, one can place in productive conversation with Gide and Hall such phenomena as the post-Stonewall emergence of gay and lesbian-feminist anti-urbanisms (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=985">Herring 2007;</a> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1071">Kleiner 2003;</a> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1405">Sandilands 2002</a>) and the more recent articulation of (some) discourses on urban cruising and public sex with organicist renderings of eroticism, freedom, and opposition to heteronormative productions of/restrictions on urban public space (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=885">Gandy 2012;</a> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1027">Ingram 2010</a>).</p>
<p class="p">From these roots, beginning in the mid-1990s (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1542">e.g., <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Undercurrents</span></span></span></em> 1994;</a> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=879">Gaard 1997</a>), a distinct body of queer ecological scholarship has emerged that has attempted to develop theoretical and activist connections between sexual and ecological politics, often drawing from ecofeminist and environmental justice perspectives and including concerted attention to the racialized, gendered, colonial, and species politics with which notions of sex and nature are articulated (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=948">especially as influenced by the writings of Donna Haraway, e.g., 1991b</a>). As Rachel Stein writes, “by analyzing how discourses of nature have been used to enforce heteronormativity, to police sexuality, and to punish and exclude those persons who have been deemed sexually transgressive, we can begin to understand the deep, underlying commonalities between struggles against sexual oppression and other struggles for environmental justice” (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1479">2004, 7</a>). This emphasis on the intersectional politics of sexuality, race, and ecology informs the work of Dayna Scott (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1421">2009</a>) and Giovanna Di Chiro (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=809">2010</a>), both of whom develop critical responses to the “gender-bending” impacts of endocrine-disrupting hormones in the environment (which particularly affect racialized and indigenous communities) while simultaneously disrupting heterosexist panics about the so-called feminization of organisms and populations of organisms, human and otherwise. Beth Berila (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=640">2004</a>), Stacy Alaimo (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=575">2010a</a>), and Mel Chen (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=739">2012</a>) likewise examine the politics of contamination as toxic affects move in, through, and <span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">as</span></span></span> gendered, sexualized, and racialized bodies: as Chen writes powerfully, toxic substances and discourses organize worlds in which some biopolitical subjects are enabled and their life optimized by medical and environmental interventions at the same time as other subjects are themselves considered toxic, expellable, and expendable. And Eli Clare (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=746">1999</a>) treats the intersections of class and disability in his account of (among other things) the varied exclusions of an urban environmental politics and aesthetics that pays scant critical attention to the ways in which people <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">work</span></span></span></em> and <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">move</span></span></span></em> in natural environments, and also to bodies and landscapes that are abjected in the production and management of the pristine.</p>
<p class="p">Sharing similar roots but on a slightly different trajectory, beginning in the late 1990s (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1518">although drawing on a longer line of inquiry, see Terry 2000</a>), research in animal behavior by the likes of Bruce Bagemihl <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=609">(1999)</a> and Joan Roughgarden <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1388">(2004)</a> has drawn popular attention to the fact that a large array of animal species include elements of same-sex eroticism in their sexual repertoires; in so doing, this research has attempted to dislodge heterosexual reproduction from its singularly privileged place in evolutionary biology, to connect notions of sexual diversity with biological diversity (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1211">for a critique, see McWhorter 2010</a>), and to open the door for a nonteleological reconsideration of animal/human sociality and pleasure (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=577">Alaimo 2010b;</a> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1046">Johnson 2011</a>). As homonormative popular culture has embraced so-called queer animals in the midst of a larger naturalization of same-sex marriage (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1492">especially “gay” male penguins, see Sturgeon 2010</a>), and as images of polymorphously perverse animal and invertebrate sex have come to populate the ideosphere in the service of sexual pluralism (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=924"><em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Green Porno</span></span></span></em> 2009</a>), several scholars suggest ways in which this queering of the more-than-human could proceed in more critical directions. Elizabeth Wilson (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1612">2002</a>) and Myra Hird (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=993">2004,</a> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=992">2008</a>) consider the ways in which nonhuman sexual and gender diversity both calls into question human exceptionalism and destabilizes notions of identity, authenticity, and technology on which modern categories of human sexual orientation rest; Karen Barad (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=616">2012</a>), deploying a notion of queer performativity to strong posthumanist ends, explores the ways in which the material world can be understood as unfolding according to a process of relational co-constitution in which materialization itself can be understood queerly (s<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1254">ee also Morton 2010</a>); and several authors call upon the queer potentialities of Deleuze and Guattari’s thought in order to nudge queer and trans theory to think more ecologically, in other words, to consider sexual and gender becomings as complex biological, technological, and political assemblages rather than as either purely discursive or biologically determined processes (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1305">Parisi 2008;</a> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1155">MacCormack 2009;</a> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=740">Chisholm 2010;</a> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/hayward-eva/">Hayward 2008</a> and, for a critique, <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/works_cited/garrard-greg-se/">Garrard 2010</a>).</p>
<p class="p">Recent scholarship has drawn from combinations of these theoretical trajectories (and beyond) to generate a proliferating array of queer ecological possibilities, including provocative considerations of cross-species and eco-sexualities as part of an ethico-political opening of love to include more-than-human corporealities (e.g., <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1089">Kuzniar 2008;</a> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1404">Sandilands 2004;</a> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1486">Stephens and Sprinkle 2012</a>); of the implications of queer theorist Lee Edelman’s critique of reproductive futurism for ecological politics (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=895">Giffney 2008; </a><a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=592">Anderson 2011;</a> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1432">Seymour 2013</a>); and of canonical literary texts, reread and restaged in light of queer ecological concerns (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=839">Estok 2011;</a> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=607">Azzarello 2012</a>). In addition, new forms of specifically ecoqueer <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">activism</span></span></span></em>, demonstrating interesting forms of coalitional politics in opposition to homonormative agendas, are also emerging in response to such concerns as violence, space, and food (<a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=996">Hogan 2010;</a> <a href="https://keywords.nyupress.org/environmental-studies/?p=1413">Sbicca 2012</a>). In both theoretical and activist milieux, however, questions remain about the specific meaning of the term “queer,” given its historically and politically unstable relations to LGBTTIQQ2SA communities and activisms; the current constellation of queer ecologies—including as it does both more conventional lgbt histories and communities and more recent challenges to these terms and political affinities—may be on the verge of something new.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="pf">Religions can be understood in their largest sense as a means whereby humans, recognizing the limitations of phenomenal reality, undertake specific practices to effect self-transformation and community cohesion within cosmological and natural contexts. Religions refer to those cosmological stories, symbol systems, ritual practices, ethical norms, historical processes, and institutional structures that transmit a view of the human as embedded in a world of meaning and responsibility, transformation and celebration. Religions connect humans with a divine presence or numinous force. They bond human communities, and they assist in forging intimate relations with the broader Earth community. In summary, religions link humans to the larger cultural, biological, and material matrices of life.</p>
<p class="p">Most definitions of religion are based on concepts from Western Abrahamic religions of God and salvation. These concepts are presented as universal, but generally do not take into account the varied kinds of religious sensibilities in the world religions, especially from Asian or indigenous traditions. Most Asian religions, for example, do not require belief in a Creator God or in redemption and salvation outside this world. Some, such as Buddhism, are considered to be atheistic, or not focused on God or supernatural beings. Religious sensibilities, thus, are not limited to monotheism or even theism. Nor does religion preclude those inner experiences associated with spirituality. The cultivation of a spiritual path has extensive roots in religious traditions and beyond. Spirituality involves a search for the sacred in which humans experience their authentic being in relation to a larger whole, for example, local bioregions, the Earth, and the cosmos itself.</p>
<p class="p">As the environmental crisis has been well documented, it is increasingly clear that human attitudes and decisions, values and behavior are crucial for the survival and flourishing of ecosystems and life forms on Earth. Religion, ethics, and spirituality are contributing to the shaping of a sustainable future along with the natural and social sciences. In addition, a more comprehensive worldview of the interdependence of life is being articulated along with an ethical responsiveness to the need to care for life for future generations. One telling of this worldview has been formulated as an evolutionary story in <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Journey of the Universe</span></span></span></em>, which is a narrative telling in film and book form by Brian Swimme and Mary Evelyn Tucker. Thomas Berry described this worldview shift as a new cosmological story.</p>
<p class="p">Certain distinctions need to be made between the particularized expressions of religion identified with institutional or denominational forms of religion and those broader worldviews that animate such expressions. By “worldviews” we mean those ways of knowing, embedded in symbols and stories, that find lived expressions, consciously and unconsciously, in the lives of particular cultures. In this sense, worldviews arise from and are formed by human interactions with natural systems or ecologies. Consequently, one of the principal concerns of religions in many communities is to describe the emergence of local geography as a realm of the sacred. This is evident, for example, with mountains such as Wutai in China, rivers such as the Ganges in India, and cities such as Jerusalem, Rome, and Mecca. Worldviews generate rituals and ethics, ways of acting, that guide human behavior in personal, communal, and ecological exchanges. Religions have also helped people to celebrate the gifts of nature, such as air, water, and food, that sustain life.</p>
<p class="p">The exploration of worldviews as they are both constructed and lived by religious communities is the work of religion and ecology scholars who attempt to discover formative and enduring attitudes regarding human-Earth relations. There are many examples of diverse ecological worldviews in religions. Buddhism sees change in nature and the cosmos as a potential source of suffering for the human while Confucianism and Daoism affirm nature’s changes as the source of the Dao, and the Western monotheistic traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam view the seasonal cycle of nature as an inspiration for the challenges of human life. Among indigenous traditions, nature is the locus for encountering the power of the sacred, such as <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">kami</span></span></span></em> for Shinto practitioners in Japan, <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">manitou</span></span></span></em> among Great Lakes Native Americans, and <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">mana</span></span></span></em> among Polynesian peoples.</p>
<p class="p">The creative tensions between humans seeking to transcend the anguish of the human condition and at the same time yearning to be embedded in this world are part of the dynamics of world religions. Christianity, for example, holds the promise of salvation in the next life as well as celebration of the incarnation of Christ as a human in the world. Similarly, Hinduism holds up a goal of <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">moksha</span></span></span></em>, of liberation from the world of <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">samsara</span></span></span></em>, while also highlighting the ideal of devotion to the god Krishna acting in the world. Indigenous traditions also manifest such creative tensions but do not move toward radical transcendence. For example, among the Navajo/Diné of the American Southwest, the Holy People come from beyond the human realm and yet reveal themselves in the inner forms of the natural world.</p>
<p class="p">This realization of creative tensions leads to a more balanced understanding of the possibilities and limitations of religions regarding environmental concerns. Many religions retain orientations toward personal salvation outside this world; at the same time they can foster and have fostered commitments to social justice, peace, and ecological integrity in the world. Historically, religions have contributed to social change in areas such as the abolitionist and civil rights movements. There are new alliances emerging now that are joining social justice with environmental justice.</p>
<p class="p">In alignment with these “eco-justice” concerns, religions are formulating broad environmental ethics that include humans, ecosystems, and other species. Scientists acknowledged this potential of religious communities for encouraging a broadened environmental ethics from their particular traditions. Two key documents were issued in the early 1990s. One is titled “Preserving the Earth: An Appeal for Joint Commitment in Science and Religion.” A second is called “World Scientists’ Warning to Humanity” and was signed by over two thousand scientists, including more than two hundred Nobel laureates. This document states, “A new ethic is required—a new attitude towards discharging our responsibility for caring for ourselves and for the earth.” Moreover, the Earth Charter, inspired by the Earth Summit in 1992, brings ecology, justice, and peace together in a scientific evolutionary framework.</p>
<p class="p">The response to these appeals was slow at first but is rapidly growing. It might be noted that there were some strong voices advocating a religious response to environmental issues over half a century ago. These included Walter Lowdermilk, who in 1940 called for an Eleventh Commandment of land stewardship, and Joseph Sittler, who in 1954 wrote an essay titled “A Theology for the Earth.” Likewise, the Islamic scholar Seyyed Hossein Nasr has been calling since the late 1960s for a renewed sense of the sacred in nature that draws on perennial philosophy. Lynn White’s essay in 1967 on “The Historical Roots of our Ecologic Crisis” sparked controversy over his assertion that the Judeo-Christian tradition has contributed to the environmental crisis by devaluing nature. In 1972, the theologian John Cobb published a book titled <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Is It Too Late?</span></span></span></em> underscoring the urgency of environmental problems and calling Christians to respond.</p>
<p class="p">Over the last several decades, key movements have taken place among religious communities that have shown growing levels of understanding of the environmental crisis and growing commitment to alleviating it. In particular, the religions have come together in innovative interreligious dialogues, witnessing to their common concern for endangered ecosystems and biodiversity. The Parliament of World Religions held in Chicago in 1993 and in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1999 issued major statements on global ethics that embraced human rights and environmental issues. The Parliament in Melbourne in 2009 had more than twenty sessions on religion and ecology. Indigenous peoples gathered in Bolivia in 2010 to formulate the <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">Universal Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth</span></span></span></em> as an expression of their concern for the degradation of land, religion, and culture. Indigenous peoples continue to report on the evidence of climate change in various regions through the Indigenous Environmental Network (ienearth.org).</p>
<p class="p">Several major international religious leaders have emerged as a result of a renewed appreciation of their tradition’s respect for the environment. The Tibetan Buddhist leader, the Dalai Lama, and the Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Nat Hahn have spoken on the universal responsibility the human community has toward the environment and toward all sentient species. The Greek Orthodox patriarch Bartholomew has sponsored symposia on water that have brought together scientists, religious leaders, civil servants, and journalists to highlight the problems of marine pollution and fisheries depletion. Many of the world religions have issued statements on the need to care for the Earth and to take responsibility for future generations.</p>
<p class="p">It is within this global context that the field of religion and ecology has emerged within academia over the last two decades, animated by several key questions. Theoretically, how has the interpretation and use of religious texts and traditions contributed to human attitudes regarding the environment? Ethically, how do humans value nature and thus create moral grounds for protecting the Earth for future generations? Historically, how have human relations with nature changed over time, and how has this change been shaped by religions? Culturally, how has nature been perceived and constructed by humans, and conversely, how has the natural world affected the formation of human culture? From a socially engaged perspective, in what ways do the values and practices of a particular religion activate mutually enhancing human-Earth relations? It is at this lively interdisciplinary intersection between theoretical, historical, and cultural research and engaged scholarship that the field of religion and ecology is still emerging.</p>
<p class="p">The values embodied by religious perspectives on the environment provide viable alternative views of nature simply as resources or as services to humans. The shared values of the world religions include <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">reverence</span></span></span></em> for the Earth and its profound ecological processes, <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">respect</span></span></span></em> for Earth’s myriad species and an extension of ethics to include all life forms, <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">reciprocity</span></span></span></em> in relation to both humans and nature, <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">restraint</span></span></span></em> in the use of natural resources combined with support for effective alternative technologies, a more equitable <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">redistribution</span></span></span></em> of economic opportunities, the acknowledgment of human <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">responsibility</span></span></span></em> for the continuity of life, and <em><span class="i"><span style="border: none;"><span style="border: none;">restoration</span></span></span></em> of both humans and ecosystems for the flourishing of life. These values are beginning to intersect with other approaches to environmental problems from the perspectives of science, economics, law, and policy.</p>
